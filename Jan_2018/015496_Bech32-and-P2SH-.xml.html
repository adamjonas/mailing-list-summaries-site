            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The concept of P2SH² improvements, which involves having the address include a single SHA256 hash of the public key or script, rather than RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) or SHA256(SHA256(script)), was previously discussed but not included in Bech32. The idea is to enable relaying the &#34;middle-hash&#34; as a way to prove the final hash is a hash itself, thereby proving it is not embedded data spam. The suggestion is that a quick revision to add this improvement to Bech32 would be worthwhile since everyone will likely be upgrading to it at some point.</p>
