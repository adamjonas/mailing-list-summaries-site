        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>Aymeric Vitte had raised a query on the inclusion of pubkey in standard p2pkh transactions, stating that it was not the case earlier. However, despite seeking answers on what motivated this change and when it happened, Aymeric did not receive any response. The reply to this query stated that there was no such behavior that existed previously and Aymeric was simply mistaken.</p>
