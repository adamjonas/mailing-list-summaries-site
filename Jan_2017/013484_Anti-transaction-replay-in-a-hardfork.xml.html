            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The context discusses proposals for a hardfork in the Bitcoin network and how to prevent replay attacks that can occur during a blockchain split. The proposal suggests creating a &#34;bridge&#34; between the old and new networks that replays all transactions from one network over to the other, preventing the need for end-users to choose which network to use. The proposal also includes rules for pre-forked coins, preventing them from being claimed by any other networks and ensuring that they belong to the network with hashpower majority. The proposal does not require any consensus changes in the existing network but introduces new SignatureHash algorithm for verifying signatures in the new network. The proposal also comes with certain limitations such as the inability to protect transactions made before the proposal. A demo of the proposal is available in jl2012&#39;s forcenet2 branch.</p>
