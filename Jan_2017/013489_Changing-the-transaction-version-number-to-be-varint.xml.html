            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In today&#39;s transaction, the version field is always 4 bytes, while the rest of the integer encoding is variable-sized. This means that most transactions have bytes 2, 3 &amp; 4 set to zero. The suggestion is to change the way the version number is serialized to be varint when accepting a new version of the transaction format. This would result in each transaction saving 3 bytes, which can be used differently in version 1 transactions and are not needed for newer formats. It would also ensure that all integers in the transaction followed exactly the same encoding, the var-int encoding. The proposal suggests implementing this change from a certain block-height as a soft fork, with a rule that only valid transactions are those that do not lie about their version number (i.e., version 1). There is currently no consensus rule that rejects transactions that lie about their version number.</p>
