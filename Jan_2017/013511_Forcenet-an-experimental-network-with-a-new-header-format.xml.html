        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, Matt expressed concern that the complexity of the new forcenet version proposed by Johnson Lau was leading to an unnecessary amount of risk. In response, Johnson Lau outlined the changes he had made to forcenet, which included a new header format with one merkle tree for transactions and a commitment header instead of merkle branches, anti-tx-replay, block sighashlimit, a new way to define tx weight, smooth halving, a new coinbase tx format with more than one input exempt from the 100 block maturity requirement, and a merkle sum tree that allows generating fraud-proof for fee and weight. However, Matt expressed concern about the scalability of the proposed method for defining tx weight. Johnson Lau justified his approach by arguing it sets an upper block resource for every metric while making the tx fee estimation a linear function.</p>
