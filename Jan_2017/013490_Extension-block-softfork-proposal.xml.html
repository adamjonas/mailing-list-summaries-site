        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>This proposal is for a pre-BIP that would create extra block space through a soft-fork while maintaining transparency to existing wallets, both senders and receivers. The soft-fork would have no impact on current security assumptions. A new type of witness program called the bridging witness program would be defined. It would allow users to spend bitcoins from the main UTXO to the xUTXO, where they could trade inside the xblock just like in the main block. However, sending money back from the xblock to the main block is the trickiest part. It requires a special xtx called the returning transaction, which sends money to a bridging witness program with a direction flag of 0x01. This transaction is not recorded in the xUTXO set but rather an output is added to the integrating tx, with the bridging witness program and corresponding value, called the “returning UTXO”. The returning UTXOs are not spendable until confirmed by 100 blocks. Fees collection in xblock is the same as normal tx, and the proposal includes two-way peg side chain design.</p>
