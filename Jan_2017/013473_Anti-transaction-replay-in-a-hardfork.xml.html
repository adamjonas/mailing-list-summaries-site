        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>This proposal suggests a way to prevent replay attacks during a hardfork, while maintaining backward compatibility. The proposal states that anti-replay protection should be optional for users on both existing and new forks, and that transactions created before the proposal is made are not protected from anti-replay. Additionally, the proposal does not require any consensus changes in the existing network to avoid unnecessary debate. The proposal also aims to fix the O(n^2) signature checking bug for non-segregated witness inputs optionally. The proposal provides rules for both the new and existing networks, with specific rationales for each rule. However, there are limitations to the proposal, including the inability to protect transactions made before the proposal and the fact that it is up to the designer of a hardfork to decide whether to respect the proposal. A reference implementation is available in the forcenet2 branch of GitHub.</p>
