            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>This proposal aims to prevent replay attacks during a blockchain split, which can occur when both forks share the same historical ledger. The proposal outlines rules for both the existing and new networks, including opt-in anti-replay options for existing network transactions on the new network, allowing time-locked transactions made before the proposal to remain valid in the new network, and verifying signatures with a new SignatureHash algorithm. However, it is not possible to protect transactions made before the proposal, and designers of hardforks must decide whether to respect the proposal. A reference implementation is available in the forcenet2 branch of the Github repository.</p>
