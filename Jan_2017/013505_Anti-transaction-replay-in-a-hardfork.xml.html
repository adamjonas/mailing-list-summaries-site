            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange between Tom Harding and Johnson Lau on January 24th, 2017, Lau pointed out that their proposals for a new network were different. Specifically, Lau&#39;s proposal was opt-in while Harding&#39;s was opt-out. Harding responded by stating that Lau&#39;s proposal would require unmodified yet otherwise compatible systems to change in order to support the new network, making it unlikely to be included in new network designs. Harding suggested that an opt-out approach would be more realistic and make sense for everyone. Lau clarified that their proposals were actually the same, with the only difference being the use of a bitwise not (~) before the network characteristic byte. This meant that Lau&#39;s proposal used a bit to opt-in to a network while opting-out of all others, while Harding&#39;s proposal used a bit to opt-out of a network.</p>
