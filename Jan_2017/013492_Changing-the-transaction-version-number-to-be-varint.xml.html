            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Tom Zander presented an idea on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to introduce a new transaction format. The proposed method involves labeling bytes 2, 3 &amp; 4 as unused and interpreting the first byte as varint from a certain block-height. Additionally, only version 1 transactions would be considered valid from that block-height. However, the proposal faces some issues such as it being a hardfork since existing nodes will not be able to deserialize the transaction and use of non-version 1 transactions is permitted. Moreover, the proposal might only require a p2p protocol upgrade rather than a soft or hard fork. There are three ways to introduce new transaction formats: through a softfork, hardfork, or p2p only which won&#39;t affect consensus.</p>
