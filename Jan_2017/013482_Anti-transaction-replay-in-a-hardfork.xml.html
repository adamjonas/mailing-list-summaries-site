            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange between Natanael and Johnson Lau, the latter proposed a scenario in which if Alice is paying Bob with an old-style time-locked transaction and Bob receives all the money on both forks after a hardfork, it is already a successful replay. However, Natanael argued that if Alice still has full control, she is already protected by his proposal, which does not require any protecting child transaction. But in cases where she may not have full control, such as in a 2-of-2 multisig of Alice and Bob, and the time-locked transaction is sending to Bob, if the time-locked transaction is unprotected in the first place, Bob will get all the money from both forks anyway, as there is no reason for him to renegotiate with Alice.</p>
