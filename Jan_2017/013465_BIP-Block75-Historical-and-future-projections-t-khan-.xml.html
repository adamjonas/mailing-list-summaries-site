            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The concept of an adaptive/automatic block size limit has been discussed for some time, although the reasons why it hasn&#39;t gained traction are not entirely clear. Concerns have been raised that such a system may not consider the optimal economic equilibrium for transaction fees and size, potentially creating unforeseen externalities for miners and users. For example, miners could decide to mine very small blocks to constrict supply and increase marginal fees, while users may push for larger and larger blocks causing higher latency and network issues. While an auto-adjusting limit is not unworkable, it would need to be built with social benefit considerations in mind, optimizing benefit/minimizing cost for both miners and users via a Marshallian surplus model. Meanwhile, a proposal called Block75 aims to keep blocks at 75% full and maintain reasonable transaction fees by altering the maximum block size every 2016 blocks based on the current average percentage full and target capacity. This approach is estimated to allow for growth while keeping blocks as small as possible and maintaining fees at a similar level to those seen in May/June 2016.</p>
