        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>The function in question was originally written for Bitcoin Core v0.8.0 with no need for a maximum length on the R and S arguments, as overly-long values would never result in valid encoded signatures according to the ECDSA specification. However, in the current proposed soft fork, non-DER results in immediate script failure, which is distinguishable from invalid signatures. The author suggests that adding individual R and S length restrictions would be trivial, but it deviates slightly from the standardness rule implementation that has been deployed for a while. Therefore, there are two options: either add the R/S length restriction rule as a standardness requirement or add it to the soft fork now.</p>
