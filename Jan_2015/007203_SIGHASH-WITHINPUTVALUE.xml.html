            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The conversation is about the limitations of memory in embedded systems and the use of dynamic memory allocation to avoid any artificial restrictions on the number of inputs or outputs. The discussion also touches upon the use of tables as an optimization technique and how it can be done in constant memory without resorting to retransmission if filled. The transaction is streamed along with its inputs interleaved in order to reduce the memory requirements. In the worst case scenario, if there are 800 inputs spending from 100kb input transactions, the system might send about 800MB of data, which could take up to half an hour if hashing runs at 45KB/s or slower. The TREZOR device uses a powerful MCU to perform validations and calculate hashes. Using SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE or similar techniques may help in cutting down hardware costs significantly.</p>
