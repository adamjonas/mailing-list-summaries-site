        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a conversation between Alan Reiner and slush, they discuss the implementation of a new signature type in the Bitcoin system. Alan explains that most soft-fork variations to achieve this require coins being spent in a special way, which would not work with existing coins and would require senders to update their software. This is deemed unreasonable by slush, who suggests a safe soft-fork approach that requires newly created addresses for those who want the new capability. They also mention the use of hardware wallets and question why a complex transaction is taking 40 minutes. Alan notes that the need for the new signature type could be addressed as a side effect of a new, more efficient checksig operator that some people have been working on.</p>
