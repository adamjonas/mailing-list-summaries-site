            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On January 4, 2015, Ross Nicoll reported a severe bug in Bitcoin&#39;s system regarding unlocked transactions being relayed or mempoled far in advance. He was testing a simple test case from chain.so that wouldn&#39;t lock until January 5th at 0028 UTC. Ross attempted to spend the transaction immediately after moving the wallet.dat file and closing the wallet, but it would either reject the acceptance to the mempool or not include it in a block. When asked for the actual raw transaction, Ross mentioned that it was a severe bug if unlocked transactions were being relayed or mempooled far in advance. Additionally, he corrected his previous statement that only final transactions could replace non-final ones. Finally, when asked if it was a major issue, Ross replied that it was an issue twice over if the first transaction could be relayed in the first place.</p>
