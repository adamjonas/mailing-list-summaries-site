            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown individual, the limitation of existing micropayment channels is discussed. The issue at hand is that payments can only flow in one direction, which is a result of ad-hoc DoS fixes over time. However, the original protocol as designed by Satoshi did not have this limitation. Hearn suggests that eventually, a different approach to handling DoS attacks based on resource prioritisation and scheduling will be needed, and at that point, the original design could be safely brought back to life. The unknown individual disagrees with Hearn&#39;s understanding, stating that expecting a replacement to work and be enforced is completely unsafe. They argue that people refuse to use protocols that are broken by refund malleability, and expecting the sequence ratchet to go one way is a much narrower expectation for miners.</p>
