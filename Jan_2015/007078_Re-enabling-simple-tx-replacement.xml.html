            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On January 4, 2015, Ross Nicoll sent an email to a group of individuals regarding his work on atomic cross-chain trading between the Bitcoin and Dogecoin blockchains. He had created a mostly functional prototype, but discovered that if the refund transaction was relayed before the actual spend transaction, it would block the legitimate spend transaction from being accepted into the memory pool. To address this issue, he drafted a patch, but had not yet raised a PR due to concerns about potential discussions on Github. Nicoll requested feedback while he continued testing the patch. However, one individual responded with concerns about the lack of protection against denial of service, stating that a single user could exhaust the relay bandwidth of the entire network by rapidly updating their transaction.</p>
