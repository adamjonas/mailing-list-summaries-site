            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange on January 23, 2015, Alan Reiner expressed the difficulty of achieving a benefit without any soft-fork approach that has favorable properties. Most of the variations of the soft-fork required the coins being spent to have been originated in a special way which would not work with existing coins and would require senders to update their software to be compatible with the goal. In response, slush suggested using newly created addresses to get coins that use the new signature type for people who want the new capability, instead of expecting every other user of the system including miners and full nodes to replace their software with an incompatible new version. Additionally, slush was sitting next to TREZOR for 40 minutes because it was streaming and validating a complex transaction but it remained unclear why it was taking that long. Alan Reiner also expected the need to be addressed simply as a side effect of a new, more efficient checksig operator which some people had been working on and off but which had taken a backseat to other more urgent issues.</p>
