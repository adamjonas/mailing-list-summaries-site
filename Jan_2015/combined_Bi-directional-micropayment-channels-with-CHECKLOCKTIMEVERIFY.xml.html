            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion between Mike Hearn and an unknown person revolves around the security concerns of Bitcoin network. The unknown person argues that even 1% of malicious miners can jeopardize the integrity of the system while Mike Hearn suggests that soundness of rules is crucial for the system to work, stating that economic soundness is better than honesty soundness. He also mentions the importance of cryptographic tools in making stronger assurances, reducing the need for trust. They discuss the limitations of micropayment channels and how they have evolved over time due to ad-hoc fixes for DOS attacks. Mike Hearn expresses concern about replacing existing protocols, as it may not be enforced and therefore unsafe.</p>
