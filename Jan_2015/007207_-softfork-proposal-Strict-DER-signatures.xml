        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>Pieter Wuille suggested adding R/S length upper bounds as both IsStandard and in STRICTDER to the softfork to make it more robust to implementation differences. Initially, there were concerns that such a softfork could create a forking risk, but the realization that imbalanced R/S plus checksig-not would only work with 0.10rc/git changed his mind. Miners no longer appear to be racing the bleeding edge, and it has never shown up in a release. The deployment of the soft-fork rules themselves will already drive people to update before the soft-fork activates for whatever stragglers there are on 0.10 prerelease code to update.</p>
