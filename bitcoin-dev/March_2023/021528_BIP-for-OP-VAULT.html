    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email chain, James O'Beirne discusses the concept of "forwarding" input amounts to specific outputs and restricting output script forms with the new "OP_VAULT" proposal. He notes that this approach makes it easier to get the logic right and facilitates spending multiple inputs to a single output. Four opcodes are considered interesting for this class: `OP_FORWARD_TARGET`, `OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE`, `OP_FORWARD_SELF`, and `OP_FORWARD_PARTIAL`. The `OP_VAULT` and `OP_VAULT_RECOVER` opcodes are named similarly to `OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE` and `OP_FORWARD_TARGET`, respectively. In the vault structure, coins are spent to an output with a taproot structure that includes `$recovery_leaf`, `$trigger_leaf`, and optional other leaves in the taptree. The trigger leaf script can include specific opcodes, such as `OP_FORWARD_SELF` and `OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE`.O'Beirne provides an example of how this might work. If someone has 2.0 BTC in a vault UTXO, they might spend 0.4 BTC by supplying witness data specifying output indices and providing a signature. The script would include `OP_FORWARD_PARTIAL`, `OP_FORWARD_SELF`, `OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE`, and `CHECKSIG`. Other inputs/outputs (for fees etc.) would still be committed to by , so nothing is malleable. The script is about 45 bytes, and the witness data is about 105 bytes.Finally, O'Beirne notes that `OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE` is equivalent to a very specific form of TLUV, which avoids introducing x-only pubkey complications and keeps things relatively simple.</p>
