    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to replace two opcodes. The new opcode, OP_TRIGGER_FORWARD, takes three arguments: output index to match against, target-outputs-hash and spend-delay. This can be generalised to idx .. npush script OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE (OP_FLU) with the behaviour being pop script from the stack, pop npush from the stack. A derived tapscript is embedded in a output scriptpubkey of the form tr(NUMS,{...,EXPR_WITHDRAW}). If the output scriptpubkey doesn't match, it fails. An existing OP_VAULT cleverness could work here, allowing for two inputs to the same output, accumulating their values. However, there is no way to refund values without having a doubled delay. A solution to this would be an additional "idx OP_FORWARD_REFUND" opcode, which has the same sPK as this input, and the total value of this input is accumulated amongst all the outputs specified by OP_FORWARD opcodes. There would be three new opcodes to cover the "accumulate value from one or more inputs into specified outputs": OP_FORWARD_LEAF_UPDATE, OP_FORWARD_DESTINATION and OP_FORWARD_REFUND, along with OP_CTV. Doing TLUV payment pools wouldn't require much more than the ability to combine OP_FLU and OP_FDEST in a single script, explicitly specifying how much value is extracted via OP_FDEST with the rest assigned to OP_FLU.</p>
