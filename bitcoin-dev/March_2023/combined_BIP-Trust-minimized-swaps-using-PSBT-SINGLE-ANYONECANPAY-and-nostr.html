        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been put forward suggesting the use of partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) to swap inscriptions in a trust-minimized and efficient way. This approach is said to be superior to two other alternatives, joinpsbts and coinswap, which are said to degrade the user experience. The BIP's author recommends using the SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY flag to create a PSBT by the seller, which is then signed and published as the offer. The buyer then updates the PSBT with the appropriate inputs and outputs. It is important to note that incorrect ordering of inputs and outputs can result in burnt inscriptions, and so the Ordinal theory uses an algorithm to determine how satoshis hop from the inputs of a transaction to its outputs, upon which the swap relies. A sequence diagram is presented showing the steps for both the seller and buyer, with the seller creating a PSBT with an inscription UTXO input and a new address with the sell amount as output. They sign the PSBT before publishing it as defined in the Network Implementation Plan (NIP). The buyer adds a new address as output in the PSBT to receive the inscription, creates a dummy UTXO if not available in the wallet, adds UTXOs to pay the seller and dummy UTXO as inputs in the PSBT, signs, and broadcasts the transaction. Two functions used by Openordex for creating PSBTs are presented in pseudocode or implementation. Links to additional resources, including an FAQ page explaining how the Ordinal theory works, are provided in the BIP. The document concludes with examples of transactions that have used the proposed approach.</p>
