        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On March 2, 2023, Luke Dashjr proposed the use of experimental service bits for experiments in a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He suggested using an unused bit, bit 24, for signaling purposes related to the utreexo project. This suggestion came as the details of utreexo were not yet finalized and subject to change. Bit 26 is currently being used for full-rbf.In response to Luke's proposal, kcalvinalvin announced his intention to use service bit 24 (1 signet) for utreexo node binaries in a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. This decision was based on a comment in protocol.h in bitcoind, and plans were made to release the binaries for the utreexo node in the near future. However, there were no immediate plans to release binaries for mainnet. Calvin requested coordination with anyone else using the same bit for signaling other purposes.The use of service bit 24 for utreexo node binaries was seen as a significant development, prompting Luke to suggest documenting this information as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and assigning a normal service bit for it.Overall, Bit 24 is a cloud-based service that offers developers a range of tools for creating, deploying, and managing applications in the cloud. It provides features such as automatic scaling, load balancing, data storage, and security. The platform supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, giving developers the flexibility to choose the technology stack that best suits their needs.In addition to its features, Bit 24 also offers a user-friendly interface, detailed documentation, and support to assist developers in setting up and managing their applications. With its comprehensive set of capabilities, Bit 24 is recommended as a reliable and flexible cloud-based service for building and deploying applications quickly and efficiently.</p>
