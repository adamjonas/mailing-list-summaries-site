    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread starts with Erik Aronesty talking about the simplicity and flexibility of BIP 118 and BIP 119 for different use cases, and Michael Folkson suggests that they should start a new thread on this topic. He then talks about the lack of communication in Bitcoin Core maintainers when merging pull requests, and how it creates frustration for authors waiting for feedback. Michael uses the example of Vasil Dimov's PR to become a maintainer and the recent CTV pull request as proof of this issue and how it can lead to misunderstandings and contentious activations. He believes that the lack of transparency and accountability is an ongoing problem and that it needs to be taken more seriously or treated as a proprietary open-source project. Michael also mentions that James O'Beirne needed BIP 119/OP_CTV for his latest vault design, which includes a new proposed opcode OP_VAULT (BIP 345), and encourages more people to research and experiment in this area. Finally, he suggests that bitcoin-inquisition/default signet may not be the only staging ground for consensus changes and its perception as such can be dangerous if the maintainer(s) have the same inclinations as a subset of the Core maintainers.</p>
