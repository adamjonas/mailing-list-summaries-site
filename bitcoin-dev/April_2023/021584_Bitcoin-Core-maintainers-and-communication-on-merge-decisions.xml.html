    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context revolves around the criticisms of the W3C process for being slow and inefficient. Many suggestions are often disregarded, leading to frustration among developers. The conversation also touches on the involvement of big companies in Bitcoin development and the need for more efficient work practices.One commenter suggests that every company involved in Bitcoin should have at least one person in the development process. This would allow for better handling of the hundreds of requests and comments that come through. They suggest having individuals from different time zones to ensure a smoother workflow.Another commenter argues that maintainers do not need to provide commentary on every merge. Instead, they argue that it is self-evident when the code is ready to be merged once a sufficient number of contributors have ACKed it. Requiring commentary would only increase the burden on maintainers and lead to burnout. They also note that PRs are often not merged because maintainers were not aware that a PR was ready or because they feel it needs further review.Finally, the commenter notes that no one is obligated to implement any feature requests. Features may be rejected or require significant revision due to interactions with other things.The context also introduces Ayms, a developer with various projects listed on GitHub. Some of his notable creations include a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin, a bitcoin NFT system, a browser version for moving coins, simplified bitcoin transactions, and developed torrent-live and node-Tor. Additionally, he offers anti-spies and private torrents with a dynamic blocklist through torrent-live.peersm.com and provides information about Peersm.</p>
