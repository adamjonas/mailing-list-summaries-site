    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine has proposed Tuesday, April 18th at 18:00 UTC as the date and time for the 6th Bitcoin contracting primitives WG meeting. He suggested discussing topics such as ANYPREVOUT+OP_VAULT, payments pools/factories, Eltoo channels, and vaults, which have been actively worked on in recent months. The proposal can be found on GitHub.Antoine apologized for the late announcement and explained that he made an announcement on #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera chat last week. He also noted that he will be hosting the meeting.Additionally, Antoine is looking for more maintainers and reviewers for the repository and aims to achieve high-quality archiving of the consensus changes documentation. He believes that the meetings are helpful for listening to what everyone has been working on and identifying if review bandwidth is needed.</p>
