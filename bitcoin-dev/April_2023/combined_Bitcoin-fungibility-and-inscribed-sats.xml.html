        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a new thread created in response to a request by one of the Bitcoin developers, the author discusses their personal involvement with Bitcoin dating back to 2010 when it was closer to their definition of money as an electronic cash system. However, they express concern about the current state of Bitcoin, which they consider more of an electronic asset than a peer-to-peer cash system due to regulation and the artificially rate-limited block size causing network congestion and high fees.The author also notes the challenges facing attempts to improve fungibility, such as regulatory hostility towards protocols like CoinJoin. They emphasize the importance of practical applications and global usability for Bitcoin to remain a global currency, despite pressure from governments, industrial lobbies, and cartels. The author believes NFTs distract from the hard work being done to ensure the safety of Bitcoin as a reserve currency.Regarding fungibility, the author believes that NFTs cannot be considered money as they are not fungible by definition. However, inscribed satoshis do not affect the fungibility of Bitcoin as there is no token standard being used, and these sats or UTXOs can be sold as normal Bitcoin on exchanges and consolidated to use as regular Bitcoin.The author is working on a coinjoin implementation to avoid censorship of post mix UTXOs on some exchanges and explains the parallel universe of Ordinals theory, where some users believe in it and try to learn how bitcoin works. Developers are interested in building things around Bitcoin and have tried to create BIP, DEX, look for libraries, ask questions, and projects implementing PSBT.The author admits to not living in a first-world country and not attending bitdevs but has always wanted Bitcoin to be accessible. They urge people to do what they want with Bitcoin without changing consensus rules as it will help Bitcoin. The message was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</p>
