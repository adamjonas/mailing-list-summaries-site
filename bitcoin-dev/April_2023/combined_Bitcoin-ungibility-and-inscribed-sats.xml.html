        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation with Steve and Bitcoin developers, alicexbt expressed the desire for Bitcoin to be considered as money. However, one of the developers pointed out that NFTs are not fungible and hence cannot be regarded as money. Alicexbt countered this by stating that inscriptions do not affect the fungibility of Bitcoin since there is no token standard being used, and inscribed sats can be sold or used like normal Bitcoin on exchanges.Alicexbt acknowledged that the fungibility of Bitcoin is subject to debate, especially with some post-mix UTXOs getting censored on certain exchanges. Nevertheless, they were working on a coinjoin implementation to address this issue. Developers were interested in building different things such as BIP, DEX, and projects implementing PSBT, while some users believed in ordinal theory to understand how Bitcoin worked.Alicexbt advocated for allowing people to do what they want with Bitcoin without altering consensus rules, suggesting it would benefit Bitcoin. Finally, they stated their aspiration for Bitcoin to be accessible to everyone despite not living in a first-world country or attending bitdevs.</p>
