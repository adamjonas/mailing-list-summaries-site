    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 5th, 2023, Murch sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing the creation of an informational BIP that would establish a shared vocabulary for various components and aspects of transactions. Murch noted that there are many competing terms in use, which can cause confusion during conversations about transactions. The proposed BIP aims to avoid this confusion by establishing a shared terminology. Murch's proposed BIP is available on GitHub, and he asks the bitcoin-dev community to review it and provide feedback. He acknowledges that some established terms are already contradictory, so the proposal does not aim to provide a perfectly consistent selection of terms. Instead, its primary goal is to establish a shared vocabulary that will help facilitate conversations about transactions. Antoine responds to Murch's email, agreeing that the proposed BIP makes sense to him as well.</p>
