    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach expressed his thoughts regarding BIP148, stating that it is making an explicit choice to favor dragging along users who have upgraded to BIP141 support over those miners who failed to upgrade. However, another user argued that if the goal of user activation is not met, then it isn't really a "user activated softfork." The user also expressed disappointment that public statements against UASF proposals detract from grassroots efforts. This led to suspicion regarding the need for public support but the inability to express one's concerns.</p>
