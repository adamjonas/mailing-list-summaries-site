    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the implementation of User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) and its relevance has been ongoing among members of the bitcoin-dev community. Some members have expressed their doubts about the necessity of UASF if a WTXID commitment is tried first. This, they believe, should be the first effort's focus. On the other hand, some members are in support of UASF as a grassroots effort. However, one member expressed disappointment that another member made a public statement against the UASF proposal, stating that such endorsements or denouncements detract from the grassroots effort. In response, the member who made the statement against UASF argued that it seems suspicious to require public support for the UASF proposal but not allow members to express their doubts about it. He also questioned the critical design feature of a particular "user activated soft fork" where users do not need to be involved, stating that if the goal is user activation, then the expectation would be that the overwhelming majority of users would be upgrading to do it.</p>
