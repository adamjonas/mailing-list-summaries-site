        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>This article discusses a potential solution to combat entropy in the divided community of bitcoin. The writer suggests that as people and businesses become vested in their perspective, it becomes minted in their identity which leads to an increase in disorder in the system. To counteract this, the writer proposes applying a rate of diminishing returns on signaling in BIP9, which requires a soft fork. This creates multiple economic incentives for the mining community to be on a similar page and greatly diminishes politics becoming a factor in the future. Acceptance of this action could be a solution to stagnation and allow parties with differing ideas the time and resources to fork responsibly without devoting resources to politics. Everyone would still have the time to voice their opinions during the burn-in/timeout period and before any code was included through technical consensus. The scaling debate is given as an example of how this solution can be applied to the current situation of bitcoin's divided community.</p>
