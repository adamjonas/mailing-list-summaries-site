    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jimmy Song and Luke, the topic of overt ASICBoost was discussed. Song claimed that overt ASICBoost is allowed on the network already, and until a proposal explicitly blocking it as a soft fork is activated, it seems to be better than the current state which is that overt ASICBoost is allowed but at a cost to BIP9 signals. However, Luke refuted this claim, stating that overt ASICBoost is not allowed right now. Even if doing it wouldn't invalidate blocks, it would still be an attack on the network and cause harm, similar to maliciously mining only empty blocks.</p>
