    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Joseph Poon and Gregory Maxwell, Poon apologized for a glib comment he made on a chat forum, but expressed offense at the idea that he had ill will. The discussion centered around a controversial protocol change that was announced in embargoed media announcements, which some believed was funded by a large miner who opposed segwit to block lightning. Poon argued that the protocol change was custom tailored to preserve covert boosting, though he specifically told others both privately and publicly that it was so it could be done in two weeks, and that the spec wasn't complete. He also noted that he had biases against doing it on the main-chain since it would benefit things if there were smart contract protections on the main chain as well. Poon denied participation in leaked chat logs where hostile statements were made, and accused Core developers of blocking him out intentionally for months before accusing him of going to journalists. Poon and Maxwell's conversation ended with Poon offering to have a public call, but saying he was taking a break from the situation.</p>
