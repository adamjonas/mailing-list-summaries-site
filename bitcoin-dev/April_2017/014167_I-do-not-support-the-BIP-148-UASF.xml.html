    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revealed that modifying the code to mine an invalid block would be intentional and not likely to happen accidentally. It was noted that if it were done accidentally, the tests would fail. However, there have been a few alternative implementations that have removed most of the tests, which could be considered reckless. Ultimately, the conclusion was made that there is no need for speculation or guessing since invalid segwit spends are not being mined currently.</p>
