    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between shaolinfry and an unknown party, shaolinfry discussed the development of user activated soft forks (UASF) for Bitcoin. Specifically, shaolinfry discussed the creation of a generalized way to deploy UASFs leveraging BIP9 for optional faster MASF activation. While BIP148 was created as a way to satisfy frustrations about the current segwit activation, shaolinfry noted that it requires a high level of consensus to be feasible. Furthermore, important players who support UASF in general do not like the BIP148 approach, which is essentially a UASF to force a MASF.Shaolinfry suggested that with BIP8, a UASF segwit deployment could be performed. He recommended a new deployment with a fresh bit that starts right after November 15th with a BIP8 timeout for April 2018. The code can be deployed much earlier, giving the economy a year to upgrade. Activation could still occur safely by MASF any time from now until April 2018. Shaolinfry is still working on implementation details, but a rough draft can be seen in the provided GitHub link. The proposed approach satisfies the more measured approach expected for Bitcoin and does not have the issues brought up about BIP148. The unknown party responded positively to this approach, stating that it addresses their main concern.</p>
