    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the compatibility of the new optimization with overt ASICBoost, a technology that provides a mining efficiency boost by toggling a single bit in the version. The change in question would create a large difference in mining efficiency until all miners update their firmware or hardware. This could give an advantage to large mining operations. Despite the need for changes in stratum and pool software, the monetary incentives align with all the necessary modifications. There is no practical way to block overt ASICBoost without forcing the version bits to be a certain value. The question then becomes whether ASICBoost should be open or hidden. The proposal does not add support but allows what is already implicitly allowed. There are potential legal implications, but those risks exist whether or not BIP-141 is modified. The difference in adding the modification is that overt ASICBoost is explicitly allowed. One concern raised is that if only one company were to make use of the extra nonce space, they would have an advantage. The response suggests that market incentives would play a role in determining how quickly this would happen. Ultimately, the discussion centers on the compatibility of the new optimization with overt ASICBoost and the decision of whether to allow it openly or hide it.</p>
