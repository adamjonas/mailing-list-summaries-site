    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author agrees with Matt's opinion that the proposed "X+Y" compromise is not a new proposal and has been discussed multiple times since fall 2015. The author believes it ignores design considerations and research from the past few years and doesn't understand the real-politic of the delays, rendering it useless in the political domain. To support their argument, the author created a Reddit thread containing previous explainers about why this proposal doesn't work in practice, even hypothetically assuming it was a great all-new idea. The author suggests that User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is a more logical step than politically motivated hard-forks like "X+Y," despite the risks associated with UASF versus SegWit BIPs in flight. The delay and risk of UASF are still lower than political hard-forks. The author set the reply-to to bitcoin-discuss to initiate further discussion on the matter.</p>
