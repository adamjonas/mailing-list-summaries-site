        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Oliver Petruzel has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) with the aim to increase block size and introduce hard fork version of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The proposed hard fork will leverage Discount Governors to control the pace of the increase over a period of 145,152 blocks which is expected to be approximately three years. This move is in response to the possible failure of the current soft fork version of SegWit to activate in November 2017.Petruzel's proposal aims to provide an alternative solution that would offer every user in the ecosystem with the necessary fixes and changes they need to move forward with other great projects. The proposal also focuses on controlling the rate at which the total weight of blocks increases during the next three years. This BIP submission hopes to address the increasing concerns related to the scalability of Bitcoin network, which has been a major hindrance for its adoption by mainstream users. The proposed hard fork version of SegWit would facilitate the integration of new features and improvements into the Bitcoin network without compromising on the security and decentralization aspects. If implemented, this proposal has the potential to overcome several technical challenges that have been faced by the Bitcoin community regarding scalability issues. However, it remains to be seen how this proposal will be received by the wider Bitcoin community and whether it will gain enough support for its implementation.</p>
