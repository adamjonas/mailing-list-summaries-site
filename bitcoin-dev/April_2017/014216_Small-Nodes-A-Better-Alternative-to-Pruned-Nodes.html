    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by David Vorick via bitcoin-dev mailing list to create an alternative to pruned nodes that would be non-risky to ship as a default in bitcoin-core. The proposal suggests the creation of 'small nodes' which will only need to store around 20% of the blockchain, reducing disk consumption from over 100GB to less than 30 GB. Small nodes will pick an index between 5-256 and Reed-Solomon coding will be used to erasure code the block using a 5-of-256 scheme, with the node picking the piece that corresponds to its index and storing that instead. When paired with any 5 unique fragments, the full block can be recovered. Nodes can optionally store more than one fragment each. To download the blockchain, a node needs to connect to five small node peers. A good encoder should be able to turn a block into a 5-of-256 piece set in under 10 milliseconds using a single core on a standard consumer desktop.</p>
