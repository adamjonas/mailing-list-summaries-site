    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitmain has been keeping ASICBOOST from their own customers and hasn't shared it with anyone else. Disabling ASICBOOST would only affect Bitmain, while other miners would be in the same position as before. However, there are possibilities that Bitmain could have already shared it with a limited number of strategic partners or offered to share it with various parties in exchange for something. They could also provide the custom firmware or software to select parties as a direct response to this disclosure to enhance their defenses against a soft fork. Another possibility is that they could share the firmware or software with every owner of their equipment in a last-ditch defense against a soft fork. It is important to keep these possibilities in mind and not make assumptions that could lead to failure.</p>
