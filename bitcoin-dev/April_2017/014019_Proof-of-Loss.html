    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mirelo, the creator of Proof-of-Loss, has made revisions to the algorithm and is requesting feedback on it. He has specified that feedback should be directed only to his email or through the links provided on the Proof-of-Loss home page. The revisions include a more explicit definition of transaction rights, an overview of how the algorithm works, and the inclusion of the current block height in the proof-of-loss data. Additionally, Mirelo corrected transaction prioritization and inactivity fees and revised the design. Proof-of-Loss is an alternative consensus algorithm that addresses the deficiencies of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. It aims to solve problems such as mining centralization and the "nothing at stake" problem.</p>
