    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Softforks and hardforks are usually defined in terms of block validity, with softforks being considered less disruptive as they are "opt-in". However, the technical definition can be misleading. Instead, the terminology is redefined in terms of software upgrade necessity and difficulty. Softforks are consensus rule changes that non-upgraded software will be able to function exactly as usual, while hardforks are consensus rule changes that non-upgraded software will cease to function or be severely handicapped. There is a continuum between softforks and hardforks, which is referred to as "hardfork-ness". For miners, any trivial consensus rule change is somewhat of a hardfork. There are three levels of "hardfork-ness" for miners, ranging from SFs that miners do not need to upgrade their software at all to complete HFs like spoonnet, which have the highest hardfork-ness. Similarly, any consensus change is a hardfork for non-mining full nodes, but a technical SF would have much lower hardfork-ness than an HF. The costs of running a boarder node can further define the hardfork-ness of SFs.In terms of fully validating wallets, BIP34, 65, 66, CSV, and Segwit all have no hardfork-ness, while extension block proposals have higher hardfork-ness. Hardfork rule changes have the highest hardfork-ness for full node wallets. Real SPV wallets should have the ability to fully validate the rules when needed, while fake SPV wallets, also known as light wallets, validate nothing and have a different hardfork-ness profile.There are interesting cases to analyze such as soft-hardforks, on-chain KYC, blacklist, account freezing, lightning networks, and side chains. Soft-hardforks are considered hardforks for every practical purpose. On-chain KYC, blacklist, and account freezing are technically softforks but very disruptive hardforks in terms of user experience. Lightning networks and side chains are not consensus rule changes and could provide new features without any hardfork-ness.</p>
