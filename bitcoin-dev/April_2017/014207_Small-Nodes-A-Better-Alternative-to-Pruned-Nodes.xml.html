    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on incentivizing nodes raises concerns about the automation of node deployment, which could be used maliciously to prevent adoption of proposals. To avoid such attacks, other projects have only distributed part of block rewards back to nodes that have committed/frozen a predetermined amount of coins that cannot be spent. This approach also reduces liquidity for market speculation and provides incentives for long-term commitments. Setting up a full node presents a barrier to entry due to bandwidth requirements and costs, particularly in third-world countries where ISPs may not provide the necessary data packages. While there is no financial incentive to run a node, many people would like to participate in the network, supporting proposals, voicing their opinions, running their own wallets, and writing their own applications on top of Bitcoin. Thus, a small node could be a worthwhile solution, despite presenting technical challenges. Financially incentivizing nodes is a complex issue, as it could allow malicious actors to automate deployment, but offering rewards for long-term commitment could be a potential solution.</p>
