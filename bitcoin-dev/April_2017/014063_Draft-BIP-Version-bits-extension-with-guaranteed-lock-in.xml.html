    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for orphaning valid old blocks has been suggested, but it has been deemed unnecessary. The "lockinontimeout" variable has been pulled out so that the same method could be used in future softfork proposals instead of hardcoding a special case hack for SegWit. It has been suggested that users should be able to set this variable in a configuration file and also set the "nTimeout" in "src/chainparams.cpp" in a configuration file. This would allow users to expedite when a softfork would become active on their node when combined with "lockinontimeout". Developers such as the Core team could put more conservative values in the program, and community members such as miners and nodes who feel more strongly about SegWit could either compile their own settings or copy a popular configuration file if such was made possible.</p>
