    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Tom Zander and James Hilliard discusses the policy rules for mining transactions on the blockchain. Hilliard claims that transactions that "everyone can spend" are prohibited from being mined due to policy rules. However, Zander clarifies that policy rules are not the same as protocol rules and are not guaranteed to be present on all mining nodes. Policy rules can be overridden, but accidentally mining invalid transactions is unlikely. Zander also explains that while policy rules are useful in making forks smoother by preventing miners and users from accepting invalid blocks and transactions, consensus rule enforcement is still necessary to avoid chain forks. The email conversation ends with Zander thanking Hilliard for his thoughtful reply and providing links to his blog and vlog.</p>
