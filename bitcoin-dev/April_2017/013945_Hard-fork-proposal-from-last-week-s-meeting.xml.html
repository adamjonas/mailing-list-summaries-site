    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil made an argument for the importance of individuals being able to run full nodes on personal computers, saying that if they can't, there is no security. Jared Lee Richardson challenged this assertion, asking for an example of an attack that would be made possible if typical personal computers couldn't run nodes. Voskuil responded by stating that governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks, which is why the blockchain's decentralized nature is so valuable. He argued that if one connects to private peers in multiple jurisdictions, it is unlikely that they would all be lying in the exact same way, making it difficult to fool the user. However, Voskuil also warned that if an individual runs their own node but fails to protect it, it can be hacked and made to lie to them.</p>
