    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses controversy surrounding the BIP16 vs BIP 17 split, which resulted in an inferior solution with issues such as a 520-byte script limit and 80-bit security. The author of the email believes that an extra two months spent on groundwork could have helped to find and fix flaws in the design of P2SH. The email also mentions BIP 148, which is seen as a way to resolve the ongoing war in the Bitcoin community. However, the author expresses concern about the proposal rejecting the blocks of passive participants due to avoidable design limitations. They believe that people are not reviewing the specifics of the proposal carefully enough and that there is a rush to implement something fast. The author encourages the Bitcoin community to remain imperturbable in the face of drama and not sacrifice correctness for a quick resolution.</p>
