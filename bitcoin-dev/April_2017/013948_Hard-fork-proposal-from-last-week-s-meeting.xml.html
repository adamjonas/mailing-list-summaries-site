    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Jared Lee Richardson, Voskuil criticized Richardson's statement that "If a typical personal computer cannot run a node there is no security". Voskuil argued that the statement was highly subjective and lacked a specific attack vector to defend against. He further stated that such logic had no place in their discussion. The email also included a quote from an unknown source stating that governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks. The email was signed with a PGP signature for authenticity.</p>
