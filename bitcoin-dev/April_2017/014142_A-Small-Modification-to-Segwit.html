    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jimmy Song responded to Jorge Tim√≥n's inquiry about the allowance of ASICBoost, stating that his main motivation is to get more miners to accept segwit rather than securing the network. He also mentioned that requiring witness commitment would require changes, while the version bit usage part does not require any code changes. However, he believes that some cleanup to restrict those bits later is probably a good idea. Jimmy expressed confusion on what to do next and asked if he should create a new BIP or convince the authors of BIP141 to modify their BIP. Jorge referred him to bip2 and stated that it may be too late to modify BIP141, but suggested proposing extensions or alternatives to replace it. He also expressed skepticism about maintaining ASICBoost, saying that it does not make the network more secure. Sancho Panza chimed in stating that the version field is still necessary for future block version upgrades and suggested using one of the reserved bits to signal for an extended version field elsewhere.</p>
