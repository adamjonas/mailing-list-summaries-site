    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gregory Maxwell has been criticized for not suggesting an alternative to the 148 proposal, which could leave the community in disarray. Praxeology Guy believes core should develop code that allows miners to create SegWit block candidates and have nodes fully verify them. Shaolinfry has proposed a solid/reliable date/height based activation, which makes SegWit default activated at the end of the BIP9 signalling timeframe. Although Praxeology Guy agrees that 148 is not ideal, it is currently the most practical and reliable method available. If 148 causes orphaning and a fork, non-SegWit miners will likely give up their orphans as users prefer non-mutable TX IDs. SegWit has undergone enough testing and it is time to activate it.</p>
