    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on 6th April, Alex Mizrahi likened the current situation with Bitcoin to that of Ethereum's DAO fork. He suggested that if a miner were to find an optimisation that only works when the version number is one, then it's their own problem once the network upgrades to version two. Furthermore, he argued that relying on undocumented features is something you do at your own risk. Jannes Faber added that limiting your operation to some arbitrary subset is also at your own risk. The comparison with Ethereum's DAO fork was deemed inappropriate as no-one suggested rolling back the last year of the blockchain to undo the damage caused by the hack.</p>
