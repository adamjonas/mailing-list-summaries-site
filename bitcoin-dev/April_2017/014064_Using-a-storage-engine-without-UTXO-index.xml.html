    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange with Marcos Mayorga, Tomas van der Wansem shared his work on a new method of indexing for verifying the order of transactions. He explained how using a spend-tree instead of an index of unspent outputs allows for better concurrency and performance when verifying individual inputs in parallel. Although his implementation is written in Rust, he believes it can be used as a pluggable module for Bitcoin Core through its interface of queries, add_tx, and add_block with blobs and flags. However, due to the current tight coupling between network and storage on the Core's side, this may not be a simple task. In addition, Tomas expressed interest in building a Bitcrust networking component to bring a strong competitor to the market. He also called for a clear separation of protocol and implementations, suggesting that updates to the protocol should only address UTXO growth and leave performance improvements to implementation details.</p>
