    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The request has been made to provide more details on the claims made regarding the reverse engineering of the Asic chip as it is crucial to have them independently verified as soon as possible. Bitmain, an industry leader in producing integrated circuits for Bitcoin mining, has confirmed that their chips support ASICBOOST and can be used for mining. However, they claim not to use it on mainnet, but this claim cannot be verified. It is possible to do covert ASICBOOST in a 100% covert manner without "transaction reordering," making it not worth analyzing blocks, etc.</p>
