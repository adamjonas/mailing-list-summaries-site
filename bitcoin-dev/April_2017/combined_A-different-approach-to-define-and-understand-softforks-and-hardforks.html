        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Softforks and hardforks are two types of consensus rule changes in blockchain technology that change the validation rules for blocks. Softforks, which are considered less disruptive, allow non-upgraded software to function as usual, while hardforks will cause non-upgraded software to cease functioning. There is a continuum between these two types of forks, which is referred to as "hardfork-ness". For miners, any trivial consensus rule change is somewhat of a hardfork, and there are three levels of hardfork-ness for miners.Fully validating wallets like BIP34, 65, 66, CSV, and Segwit do not have any hardfork-ness, while extension block proposals have higher hardfork-ness. Hardfork rule changes have the highest hardfork-ness for full node wallets. Real SPV wallets should have the ability to fully validate the rules when needed, while fake SPV wallets, also known as light wallets, validate nothing and have a different hardfork-ness profile.There are interesting cases to analyze such as soft-hardforks, on-chain KYC, blacklist, account freezing, lightning networks, and side chains. Soft-hardforks are considered hardforks for every practical purpose, while on-chain KYC, blacklist, and account freezing are technically softforks but very disruptive hardforks in terms of user experience. Lightning networks and side chains are not consensus rule changes and could provide new features without any hardfork-ness.</p>
