    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted on March 24, 2017, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer expressed concern that a proposed approach of filling empty blocks with transactions could lead to forks and create a new attack vector. He stated that the lack of consensus on the contents of the mempool makes this approach unsafe. Additionally, he warned that bad actors could time the flood of new transactions with the discovery of a block by a competitor in order to orphan the block and fork the chain. Although this was a delayed reply, Sirer clarified his original post to ensure that his intentions were not misinterpreted.</p>
