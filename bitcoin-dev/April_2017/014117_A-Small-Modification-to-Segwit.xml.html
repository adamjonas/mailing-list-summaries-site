    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jimmy Song responded to Jorge Timón's question regarding why an attacker wouldn't use ASICBoost as well. Song explained that an overt ASICBoost can be used on the network today and his proposal is to bring ASICBoost usage out into the open instead of hiding it. He mentioned that if someone figures out an ASIC optimization unrelated to ASICBoost that gives X% speed boost over non-ASICBoosted implementation and ASICBoost were banned, then someone with this optimization could get 51% of the network by adding N machines with their new optimization. If ASICBoost were allowed, someone with this optimization would need 1.2N machines to get 51%. Song argued that the network in that sense is 20% stronger against this attack in terms of cost. Jorge Timón asked why higher hash rate would secure the Bitcoin network better against newer optimizations. Song responded by explaining that if some newer ASIC optimization comes up, it would be better to have an ASICBoosted hash rate to defend with than a non-ASICBoosted hash rate. Having a higher hash rate makes the network more secure against newer optimizations. Timón argued that whether all miners use ASICBoost or only a subset of them, he remained unconvinced that it provides any additional security to the network, even if it results in the hashrate charts looking "more secure."</p>
