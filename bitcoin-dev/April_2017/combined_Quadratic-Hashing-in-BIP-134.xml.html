        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 134 (BIP 134) has recently been updated to include support for SIGHASH_SINGLE and its counterparts. However, this reintroduces some quadratic hashing behavior because SerializePartialTransactionv4 is called per non-SIGHASH_ALL input. As a result, if each input in a transaction has one SIGHASH_SINGLE CHECKSIG operation, the total amount of hashing done for the transaction will be quadratic in the number of inputs.Although the amount of hashing is not as severe as with the SIGHASH_ALL case, it is still non-linear. This means that while the introduction of SIGHASH_SINGLE and its counterparts is a positive development for Bitcoin transactions, users should still be aware of the potential impact on performance. It is important to note that this issue only applies when using SIGHASH_SINGLE or its counterparts and does not affect other signature types.Overall, the latest update to BIP 134 adds valuable functionality to the Bitcoin network but also highlights the importance of understanding the potential consequences of different transaction types. As with any technology, it is crucial for users to stay informed and use best practices to ensure optimal performance and security.</p>
