    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin-Dev community named Daniele Pinna requested more details on the reverse engineering of the Asic chip, and emphasized the importance of having these claims verified independently as soon as possible. This request came after a BIP proposal was made by Gregory Maxwell regarding inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin POW function. Maxwell's proposal stated that each block must contain either a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. However, it was later discovered that this proposed ID collided with another non-BIP proposal, which Maxwell promised to change when he updates the document. The fact that this kind of attack is possible highlights the need for measures to be taken against it.</p>
