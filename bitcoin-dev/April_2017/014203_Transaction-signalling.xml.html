    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>One member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim, doesn't have a general opinion on signaling, but does express concern about using addresses for signaling, citing privacy implications. Christian Decker responds to Tim's concerns, suggesting that extending signaling capabilities to end-users would give stakeholders a voice in network decisions and provide data for informed decisions. Decker suggests several fields that could be used for signaling, including OP_RETURN, locktime, and output scripts, but ultimately decides that output scripts are likely the best option due to their easy tallying and the fact that they are already stored in the UTXO. However, Decker also mentions some downsides to this approach, such as the possibility that users who don't intend to signal will still be included in the tally. Despite these potential issues, Decker is excited about the prospect of providing data for informed decisions and putting an end to speculation about the economic majority.</p>
