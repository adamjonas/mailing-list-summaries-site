    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new BIP draft has been proposed to tackle the issue of ASICBOOST mining, after it was conclusively proven that the technology had been implemented in hardware. The proposal is aimed at inhibiting the covert use of the technology which is incompatible with improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. The proposal states that until block Y, each block's coinbase transaction must contain a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. Miners are urged not to discontinue the commitment after the expiration height. A more detailed explanation of the Merkle tree structure and clarity on why the commitment wasn't required as part of SegWit has been requested by Joseph Poon.</p>
