    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer discusses the ethical implications of the recent Bitcoin Cash hard fork, comparing it to a software company relying on an undocumented feature in an operating system. The loss suffered by the software company would be seen as their own fault for taking the risk of relying on such a feature. Similarly, the writer argues that the responsibility for any losses caused by the BCH fork lies with those who chose to rely on it, rather than the developers who implemented the change. The writer suggests that this view is widely held among programmers and is ethically unambiguous, except perhaps for those affiliated with Bitmain.</p>
