    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new node could be introduced with the ability to be a pruned node, allowing it to trust one or more peers for the initial blockchain download and prune blocks older than a chosen time. The unspent transaction outputs are already kept in a separate database, so removing old blocks is technically possible. David Kaufman suggests that reducing the storage requirement to 30GB from 100GB may encourage more people to run full Bitcoin nodes, but scalability and adjustability also need to be considered as the blockchain grows in size. The possibility of smaller and smallest nodes that can be configured to store more or less of the blockchain will be necessary to motivate most users to run nodes. The blockchain would then begin to look similar to a bittorrent, however, it does not have to be downloaded fully.</p>
