    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Steven Pine and Gregory Maxwell on the Bitcoin development listserv touches on various issues surrounding the activation of SegWit. Pine asks about the "time out" as defined in BIP 9, with the date of November 15th, and whether Core plans to release another BIP with a new timeout hoping it will eventually get 95% consensus. Maxwell responds that this is untrue and that SegWit would continue until something clearly better came along or people lost interest in it. Pine also asks about the history of changes made to Bitcoin and whether the currently discussed UASF goes through, it would seem like the first time census occurred outside core's mailing list of pull requests, acks, and merge to master. Maxwell notes that there isn't much of "the core team" and that everything ends up being retroactively defined as the core team, with open participation and hundreds of contributors and software running everywhere in the network. Lastly, Maxwell suggests not being outright reckless and taking risks while keeping in mind the concerns of others in the community.</p>
