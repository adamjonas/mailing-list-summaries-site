    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer proposes a potential way to combat entropy in a divided community of bitcoin. As people and businesses become involved and vested in their perspective, it becomes minted in their identity which leads to the increase of disorder in the system. The scaling debate is a fore-bearer of this. To counteract entropy while not relying on game-able metrics, the writer suggests applying a rate of diminishing returns on signaling in BIP9, which would require a soft fork. This creates multiple economic incentives for the mining community to be on a similar page and as a feature of a soft forks greatly diminishes politics becoming a factor in the future. Acceptance of this action could be a solution to stagnation and allow parties with differing ideas the time and resources to fork responsibly without devoting resources to politics. Everyone would still have the time to voice their opinions during the burn-in/timeout period and before any code was included through technical consensus.</p>
