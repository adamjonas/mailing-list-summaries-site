    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A bitcoin developer has dismissed the idea that the core team would abandon SegWit if it did not activate until November. He stated that the solution will continue to be used until something clearly better comes along or people lose interest in it. The developer also clarified that since there isn't a clear definition of "the core team", it is unlikely that an outsider can make a credible proposal without contributing to the project or without help from someone who has. Additionally, he expressed concern over some individuals expecting changes that are orders of magnitude faster than those in centralized systems that are far easier and safer to take quickly. He urged caution and advised stakeholders to figure out how to meet one another's concerns before implementing changes.</p>
