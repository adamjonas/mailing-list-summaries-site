    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development discussion, the use of MMR data structure for transaction output (TXO) commitments was brought up. The suggestion was made that wallets should only keep information relevant to their own spendable coins and maintain the changing MMR proof for their old coins. However, it was also noted that wallets need to know the spentness status of close relatives in the MMR tree to construct a valid MMR proof that their own coin is not spent. Another participant in the discussion proposed an alternative solution called the TXO bitfield, which would allow wallets to track only the proof of position of their TXO, avoiding the need to keep track of other data.</p>
