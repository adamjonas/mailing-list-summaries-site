        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A growing concern in the Bitcoin community is the centralization of mining power. This has become controlled by a small group of individuals who have expressed interest in hijacking the network for their own agenda, posing a threat to the validity of the blockchain. Proposed solutions include updating nodes to ignore empty blocks and abnormally small blocks compared to the number of valid transactions in the mempool. However, there are concerns about how this will impact consensus and potential risks and attacks resulting from having such new rulesets or doing nothing.The upcoming network upgrade to larger blocks in Bitcoin has raised concerns about blockchain splits, confusion, and replay risks. Two proposed techniques have been suggested to reduce the chances of a split: orphaning the blocks of non-upgraded miners once a super-majority of the network hash power has upgraded, and continually re-organizing any minority branch that emerges with empty blocks to prevent transactions from confirming, thereby eliminating replay risk. There are also concerns regarding the centralization of mining power in the Bitcoin network, which could lead to a dangerous agenda to hijack the Bitcoin network. Proposed solutions include increasing the number of full nodes and designing incentives for people to run full nodes. It is also suggested to activate proof of space by anticipation as an alternative solution. In addition, there needs to be discussion on various attacks and how they can be guarded against along with various other contingency plans.Peter R suggests that users should have the power to adjust the size of blocks their nodes accept, which could be accomplished by a simple patch to Bitcoin Core 0.14. Some members of the community believe that a peaceful split would be preferable to these proposed tactics for enforcing the upgrade. The lack of clarity around whose proposal the "network upgrade" was and the use of sales tactics in the explanation of the proposal were also questioned.An email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list from cannon at cannon-ciota.info containing a notice stating that all email correspondence not signed/encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private. The author recommends using PGP if privacy is a concern for the recipient.There were also discussions raised over the language used to describe future network upgrades, using the term "network upgrade" instead of the accepted technical term "hard fork," which was found to be misleading. In terms of the activation of SegWit, there are concerns about a 50% attack, measures such as orphaning the blocks of non-upgraded miners and continually re-organizing a minority branch with empty blocks have been proposed to reduce the risk of a split.Overall, there are concerns regarding the impending network upgrade to larger blocks in Bitcoin and the language used to describe future network upgrades. Proposed solutions include orphaning non-upgraded miner blocks and continually re-organizing any minority branch that emerges with empty blocks to prevent transactions from confirming. There are also concerns over the centralization of mining power and the lack of precision and consistency in discussing soft forks versus hard forks.</p>
