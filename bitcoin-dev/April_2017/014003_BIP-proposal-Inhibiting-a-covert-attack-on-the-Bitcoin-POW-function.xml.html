    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the email exchange involves a conversation between two individuals, Joseph Poon and gmaxwell. Poon participated in an unusual announcement of a protocol change that was not sent for community review and seemed to preserve covert boosting and incorporate support for lightning. Reports suggest it was funded by a miner. When people asked for revisions, they were told there would be none, and Poon made hostile statements claiming that Bitcoin project contributors opposed the proposal for "nonsense reasons". In response to Poon's attempt to initiate an off-the-record conversation, gmaxwell expressed concern about being implicated in a potential conspiracy and requested communication via third-party transferable proof. While gmaxwell acknowledges that the chat remark may have been inappropriate, he considers Poon's recent actions highly concerning.</p>
