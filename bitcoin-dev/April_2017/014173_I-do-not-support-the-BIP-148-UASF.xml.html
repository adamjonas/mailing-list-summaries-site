    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Steven Pine and Bitcoin Core developers, the discussion centered around BIP 9 bit allocations. It was noted that there is a technical requirement for a timeout to avoid burning bits forever if a proposal is abandoned, but itâ€™s a timeout for the bit assignment rather than the proposal itself. Core developers don't plan beyond immediate activities, so there isn't a "core defined process" for changes. Furthermore, if a proposal hasn't been activated but still has interest, it can get a new bit assigned to it. In regards to BIP148, it's not classified as a user activated soft-fork, but instead as "user enforced miner soft-fork activation." The limitation of this approach is that it likely cannot achieve low disruptiveness, which could be excusable if there were no alternative, but in this case, there is one.</p>
