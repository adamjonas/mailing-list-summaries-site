    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When it comes to running a Bitcoin node, most people prefer to use the hardware they already own instead of buying new ones. However, this can be problematic as the hardware usually has limited disk space, such as a common 500GB SSD with no HDD. The biggest issue that prevents people from running a full node is the fear of losing disk space. This psychological aspect is more important than any example of cheap hard drives, as most people are not willing to purchase a hard drive just for running Bitcoin. As per the writer's experience, when asked why they don't run a full node, most people tend to give the same answer.</p>
