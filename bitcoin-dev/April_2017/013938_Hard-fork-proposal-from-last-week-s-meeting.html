    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil responded to Rodney Morris' suggestion that not every personal computer needs to run a full node. Voskuil stated that failure to understand the Bitcoin security model is the cause of the block size debate and that if a typical personal computer cannot run a node, there is no security. He argued that those who can run and trust their own nodes likely already have something better than a typical personal computer. Voskuil suggested that lightweight clients with multiple servers, zero-knowledge proofs, and hardware wallets could help reduce required trust. He also proposed managed hardware in the style of Chromebooks as the only plausible solution for everyone to run their own full nodes, but noted that this would still require trusting the same people whose nodes one would otherwise rely on.</p>
