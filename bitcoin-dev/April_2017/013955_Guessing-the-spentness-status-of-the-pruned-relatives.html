    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bram Cohen, a computer programmer and creator of the BitTorrent protocol, shared his approach to research and development. He believes it's appropriate to explore all interesting ideas and help each other improve their ideas before deciding which option to go with when there is a deadline that needs to be met. Currently, he is still in the exploration phase. When asked about his opinion on the Patricia Tree for bitcoin txos, he stated that he thinks it's too much work for everyone to do when other options are available. However, he clarified that he wasn't saying the design is bad or won't work, but he personally isn't interested in it at this time.</p>
