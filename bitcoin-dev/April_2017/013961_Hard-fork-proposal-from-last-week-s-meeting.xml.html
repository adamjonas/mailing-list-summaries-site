    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jared Lee Richardson expressed his concern about the ongoing debate over on-chain scaling versus layer two scaling. He argued that it is unhealthy for Bitcoin and both sides need to accept that microtransactions from all humans cannot go on-chain. Additionally, never increasing the blocksize does not mean millions of home users will run nodes. Richardson believes that in order for layer two scaling to flourish, on-chain bandwidth has to be available and sharding solutions should be investigated so that not every transaction has to pass through each node and without the need of channels but protocol between nodes. In his opinion, people who believe that in order to promote layer two scaling, on-chain scaling has to be severely limited are wrong. Artificial scarceness of on-chain bandwidth is not the solution to promote layer two scaling.</p>
