    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 26, 2017, Luke Dashjr posted a message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the capabilities of scriptSig and witness in Bitcoin transactions. Dashjr noted that there are certain things that scriptSig can do that witness cannot do currently. Specifically, scriptSig is able to add additional conditions under the signature. However, Dashjr suggests that scriptSig can be made obsolete after segwit provides an alternative way to achieve this. Another member of the mailing list responded, stating that they were unsure about what Dashjr was referring to, as the data in scriptSigs are never signed. Instead, scriptSigs are always stripped from the transaction before the sigHash is made. The email also included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed.</p>
