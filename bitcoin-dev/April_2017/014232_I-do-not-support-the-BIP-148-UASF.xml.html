    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 25th, 2017, a discussion about the best approach to a UASF for segwit was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Gregory Maxwell suggested an alternative approach that he believed would satisfy the more measured approach expected for Bitcoin and would not have the same issues as BIP148. Another participant in the discussion, Luke-Jr, expressed disagreement with this approach, believing that if a UASF for segwit is going to be done at all, it needs to have a clearly decisive outcome, which is provided by BIP148. He also stated that using the approach in BIP8 could create prolonged uncertainty where nobody knows the outcome when segwit's rules are challenged by a malicious miner. However, he did suggest that if BIP148 fails to achieve widespread support, a BIP8-based UASF with Segwit v2 (along with some other changes he suggested in the other thread) could be done.</p>
