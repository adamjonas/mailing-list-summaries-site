    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Tomas questions the storage engine and proposes a few deductions based on his understanding. He believes that bitcrust's anti-DoS feature should limit the number of previous 1-in-100-out txs to prevent negative effects on performance. Limiting 1-in-100-out txs would also limit UTXO growth. However, efficiency claims are only for order validation, assuming all transactions are pre-synced and verified. Mempool optimization is necessary to optimize the disk and memory usage of bitcrust, but it is not yet supported. In response, there was no intention to step on anyone's toes with regards to SegWit's model. Challenging established models and proposing protocol improvements is always welcome. However, for the hardfork design, a stricter UTXO growth limit is being considered. Bitcrust's model may not benefit from this but it is worth considering protocol improvements.</p>
