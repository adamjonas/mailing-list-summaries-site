    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 14 April 2017, Tom Zander responded to Gregory Maxwell's statement about Segwit being engineered so that older unmodified miners could continue operating without interruption after segwit activates. Zander claimed that it was false because a segwit transaction to the miner would be an "everyone can spend" transaction and a miner who does not validate the segregated area in a post-segwit world would be able to create blocks that would not validate for segwit miners by including a transaction that spends a SW tx. This would lead to a chain-fork as the SW miners reject it and the non-SW miners continue to mine on it. However, those "everyone can spend" transactions are prohibited from being mined due to policy rules. The only risk is in regards to mining on top of an invalid block that intentionally mined an invalid SW transaction.</p>
