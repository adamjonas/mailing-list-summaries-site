    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the concept of burn that happens regardless of whether a miner successfully mines or not. It is not a proof of stake when miners cannot know which transactions are burns and when the majority of burns cannot be used for mining and are simply lost. Crafting a burn-network could make it possible for a miner to prevent a burn by preventing all transactions other than their own, but this is still a weakness. There is no ethical issue with blocking an upgrade if one relies on undocumented features as limiting one's operation to some arbitrary subset is at one's own risk. The comparison to the DAO fork is not valid since there is no suggestion of rolling back the last year of the blockchain to undo the damage already done.</p>
