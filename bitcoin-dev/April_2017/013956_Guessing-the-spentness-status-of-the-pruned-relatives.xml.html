    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Bram Cohen and praxeology_guy, the topic of exploring interesting ideas in R&D was discussed. When there is a deadline that needs to be met, various options are compared and a decision is made. Praxeology_guy stated that he is still on the first step of exploring ideas. Bram Cohen suggested that he should read his txo bitfield proposal instead of responding to something unrelated. In response to Bram's suggestion, praxeology_guy expressed that he is not a fan of the Patricia Tree for bitcoin txos and believes it to be too much work when other options are available. Bram clarified that his bitfield proposal is different from the patricia trie stuff and that praxeology_guy's objection about patricia tries being 'too much work' is nonsensical because they're quite a bit simpler than MMRs.</p>
