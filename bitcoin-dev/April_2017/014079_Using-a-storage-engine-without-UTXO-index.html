    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the optimization for lower memory platforms, Eric Voskuil suggested that reducing the need for paging can be achieved through the use of cache. He explained that in high RAM systems, any cache is a de-optimization, but on low RAM systems, it can prevent excessive paging. However, another participant in the discussion disagreed with this idea, stating that sorting data from least frequently used to most frequently used would beat any application-layer cache, regardless of the size of data and RAM. The participant argued that an application-layer cache only makes sense if there is a hard distinction between often-used and not often-used data. In all other cases, caching is best left to the operating system by focusing on proper spatial and temporal locality of reference of the data, as the OS has more information to make the right decision.</p>
