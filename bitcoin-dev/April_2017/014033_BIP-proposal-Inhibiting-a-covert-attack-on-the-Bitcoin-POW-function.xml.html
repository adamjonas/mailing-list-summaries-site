    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin developer community is currently considering a proposal to modify the blockchain code in order to reduce the gains made by Chinese mining company, Bitmain, through the use of patented mining algorithms. Some developers see ethical similarities between this situation and the DAO fork, where developers and users colluded to reduce the wealth of a single entity, but acknowledge differences also exist between the two situations. While some argue that rule changes should not be employed as a means of disempowering particular entities without very good reason, others believe that the perceived incentive problem at protocol level justifies such action. However, concerns have been raised about the fact that the proposed change only addresses one form of covert asicboost and does not block other overt forms.</p>
