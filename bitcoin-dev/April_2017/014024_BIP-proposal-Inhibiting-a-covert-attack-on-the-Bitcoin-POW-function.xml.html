    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to inhibit covert exploitation of a known vulnerability in Bitcoin's Proof of Work function. This attack is called ASICBOOST and allows an attacking miner to save up to 30% of their energy costs. There are two ways of exploiting the underlying vulnerability in the Bitcoin mining process, and one of them is highly detectable. However, the other method can be easily used covertly and could result in payoff of as much as $100 million USD per year. In response, a BIP proposal has been offered to prevent any covert forms of this attack.The proposed rule requires the coinbase transaction of each block to either contain a BIP-141 segwit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef, beginning block X and until block Y. The proposal does not include blocking the non-covert form because it may become generally available without restriction in the future, does not generally interfere with improvements in the protocol, and can be detected and blocked if it becomes an issue in the future. Some have argued that blocking the use of this covert technique is unethical or wrong, but others see it as just another instance of miners acting in their self-interest and devs trying to secure the network and increase decentralization.The context provided states that any posts made must not contain personal attacks and should be related to the development of Bitcoin. The focus of the posts should be centered around the advancement and progress of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Additionally, it is important to note that the term "Bitcoin" refers to a digital currency that operates independently of any central bank or government.Since its creation in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has gained widespread popularity and acceptance among investors, businesses and consumers alike. Furthermore, there are several factors that contribute to the success of Bitcoin, including its decentralized nature, strong security features, and ability to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. However, there are also challenges and limitations associated with Bitcoin, such as scalability issues and concerns about its potential for use in illegal activities.Overall, the development of Bitcoin is an ongoing process that involves collaboration and innovation from developers, investors, and users. As such, it is important for all stakeholders to contribute positively to the discourse surrounding Bitcoin and to work towards improving its functionality, security, and accessibility for all.</p>
