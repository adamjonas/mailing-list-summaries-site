    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 16, 2017, Erik Aronesty, a member of the bitcoin-dev group, proposed a solution to protect hardware and infrastructure investment from ASIC. The solution involves using eight or more secure hashes, each implementable on GPU/CPU, that rotate through them - per block round robin. He also stated that the write time for configuring a FPGA with a fresh bitstream takes only tens of milliseconds. According to him, ASIC will never be able to beat this solution because it will be 8 times more expensive to maintain the cold circuits.Furthermore, unused circuits do not consume power, which is the main cost in running a miner. This proposal would therefore make it less expensive to maintain the system as compared to ASIC.</p>
