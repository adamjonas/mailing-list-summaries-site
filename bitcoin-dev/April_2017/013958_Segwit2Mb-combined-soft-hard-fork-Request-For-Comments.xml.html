    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An email conversation between two individuals, Natanael and Jorge Timón, regarding SegWit has been shared. The conversation includes discussions on the difference between a hardfork and softfork, the weight limit of 4MB, and the maximum ratio limit. The weight limit of 4MB is not as much as the size limit of 4MB but both are bigger than the current maximum size of 1MB. The advantages of having one single limit instead of two limits have also been discussed. It is mentioned that if the ratio needs to be modified it can be done before any rule changes are activated. Lastly, the benefits of SegWit being backward compatible as a bip9 softfork have been highlighted.</p>
