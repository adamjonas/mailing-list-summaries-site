    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed a security issue that could be resolved through a soft fork included in Bitcoin Core. Gregory Maxwell suggested a trigger 3-6 months from release for sufficient adoption by the economy. It was proposed to use a modified form of users' choice of the segwit commitment to lower the technical complexity and risk. A dozen off-list emails presented questions regarding other protocol upgrades that require additional transaction-dependent commitment data, including Segwit, UTXO commitments, committed Bloom filters, committed address indexes, STXO commitments, weak blocks, and most kinds of fraud proofs. However, putting any commitment to data dependent on the right-hand side of the hash tree in the left-hand side means a massive increase in computation required for covert boosting. Joseph Poon explained that the proposal only addresses the second concern of making covert boosting less appealing in general. Use of the segwit-style commitment even in non-segwit blocks is sufficient because the segwit commitment commits to all transactions (except the coinbase) and not just segwit ones.</p>
