        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell has proposed a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at blocking covert mining operations that use the ASICBOOST exploit. The proposal seeks to inhibit the covert exploitation of a vulnerability in Bitcoin's proof-of-work function by requiring coinbase transactions to include either a BIP-141 segregated witness commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef, beginning at an unspecified block and ending at another unspecified block. This will prevent miners from using the fast path for finding hash collisions through several hashing rounds. The Bitcoin mining process hashes an 80-byte 'block header' while incrementing a 32-bit nonce. The proposal is to add a commitment to the block header, which would make it difficult for miners to use ASICBOOST, a technique that gives miners an unfair advantage in proof-of-work mining. The proposal suggests adding either a BIP-141 SegWit commitment or a correct WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ef. This change could be disruptive and not necessary since there is no reason to believe that it is currently required. If the proposed rule is no longer needed due to the introduction of stronger rules or acceptance of version-grinding form, it will automatically sunset. If it is still useful at expiration time, the rule can simply be extended with a new softfork that sets longer date ranges, avoiding the accumulation of technical debt due to retaining enforcement of this rule when it is no longer needed without requiring a hard fork to remove it. The non-covert form of the attack can be blocked by requiring that the header version match the coinbase transaction version, but this proposal does not include this block because this method may become generally available without restriction in the future, does not generally interfere with improvements in the protocol, and because it is so easily detected that it could be blocked if it becomes an issue in the future. The proposal does not nullify ASICBOOST entirely, but it proposes severely handicapping the covert form of it, and eliminating the differential advantage for boosting miners related to the use of transaction-dependent commitments. It only addresses the second concern, by completely leveling the playing field so that opposing commitments will not break boosting any worse, and making covert boosting less appealing in general. In summary, the proposal only adds the commitment to the block header, which would make it difficult for miners to use ASICBOOST, a technique that gives miners an unfair advantage in proof-of-work mining. If activated, the move would render ASIC chips that take advantage of this vulnerability incompatible with Bitcoin's network.</p>
