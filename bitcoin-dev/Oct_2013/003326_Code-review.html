    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Git is an effective tool for creating long series of commits towards achieving some useful goal. However, it is not ideal for code review as it can be difficult to keep track of changes made in later commits, which can make it harder to review code that uses new APIs or behavior changes introduced earlier. To address this issue, the author suggests either submitting large pieces of work as one giant squashed change or keeping commits logically clean and separated. Additionally, the author highlights Github's lack of focus on basic improvements for code review and suggests using Review Board, an open source code review tool with git integration and various features such as side by side diffs and the ability to attach screenshots to reviews. The company behind Review Board offers hosting plans, but the tool can also be hosted on a Foundation server instead.</p>
