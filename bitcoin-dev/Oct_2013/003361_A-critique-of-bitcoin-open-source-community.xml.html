    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Mitar shared an interesting article about a loose code of conduct for the Bitcoin community. While he agreed with some points made in the article, he thought it was slightly harsh. He suggested that the community could benefit from adopting a similar code of conduct as Ubuntu, which has been successful in helping to grow their community. The Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0 emphasizes collaboration, respect, taking responsibility for actions and decisions, and valuing diversity. It also outlines leadership, authority, and responsibility, teamwork, open meritocracy, and conflicts of interest. The email conversation was part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
