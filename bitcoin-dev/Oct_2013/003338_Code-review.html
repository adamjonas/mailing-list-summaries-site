    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn requested that when submitting large, complex pieces of work for review, it should either be submitted as one giant squashed change or be an absolute fascist about keeping commits logically clean and separated. Gavin Andresen agreed to try harder to keep commits logically clean and separated. They also discussed the use of Review Board, a tool for code review. Gavin Andresen noted that he is all for using better tools but worries that requiring potential reviewers to sign up and learn another tool may make the pool of reviewers even smaller than it already is. They then looked for examples of how other open source software projects incentivize review and suggested that only people who significantly helped test or review other people's code should be thanked in the "Thank You" section for the 0.9 release and onwards.</p>
