    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community has reflected on the BIP39 wordlist and changes have been made to improve it. Offensive words have been removed, and an algorithm has been implemented to detect words with similar characters. Duplicities have been resolved, making the wordlist more satisfactory. Password protection of seed and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher has also been added. The blocksize can be 128, 192 or 256 bits, which fits the desired length of seeds, and Rijndael implementations are available in every language. This algorithm will be used in Trezor, and other wallet developers want to implement it into clients to be compatible with Trezor. There were strict requirements for such algorithm, including the possibility to convert mnemonic to seed as well as seed to mnemonic, and a good solution has been found. Comments are welcome, but constructive feedback is preferred. Matthew Mitchell removed some offensive words from the wordlist, but didn't add enough back in. Pavol Rusnak revisited the wordlist and replaced around 67 words that can be found offensive in some context.</p>
