    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Melvin Carvalho is working on porting crypto currencies to the semantic web, allowing new types of innovation and spreading bitcoin information to a wider audience. The first step is to create a "vocabulary" for bitcoin, which is like a dictionary of terms that can be put down in a machine-readable standard called RDF. To do this, he asks if anyone has worked on this before or if there is a human readable "glossary" for bitcoin that he could take text from. He has made a start on creating the vocabulary and is hosting it at <a href="https://w3id.org/cc">https://w3id.org/cc</a>. Melvin plans to model all crypto currencies in time, starting first with bitcoin. The use case is that a publisher would like to link their web page content or app to a bitcoin address so that donations can be received by those who have enjoyed their work. The model will be something like URI -> crypto-currency-address -> bitcoin-address and the folks at w3id.org have offered to use their permanent identifier switchboard, then redirect to a locked-down vocabulary. As an implementer, one simply needs to add a single rel= tag to their markup. In a web page or HTML5 app, one can use href="bitcoin:1234....". For litecoins (coming soon), one can use href="....">. It's just a small step to start with but can allow all sorts of entities to start accepting bitcoin in a way that complies with the W3C best practices. Melvin will be improving and extending this over time and feedback or help is welcome.</p>
