    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the use of a github clone, gitlab, as a potential solution to improve the BIP process. The suggestion is to build Bitcoin into such a BIP system where individuals can donate Bitcoins to support a proposal and those who implement the BIP can receive a percentage of the bounty while some goes to the Bitcoin foundation. This platform could also be used to create assurance contracts to kickstart BIP developments or Bitcoin extensions. In response to specific questions, the protocol specification page could benefit from being codified into BIPs but would require a rewrite in a more modular and formal form. The current wiki pages should be kept up there, maybe with a link to the git repo on the main BIP index wiki page. Finally, BIP 50, which is a hardforking protocol change, should be considered a BIP.</p>
