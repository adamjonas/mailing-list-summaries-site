    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The wallet app can create and sign three transactions, paying avg-std.D, avg, and avg+std.D fee in one go. However, there are several issues that arise from this approach. In a setting where the user signs a transaction created offline, transmitted via Bluetooth via a one-way broadcast, it is unclear how all three transactions would be transmitted to the receiver and whether they would do the "right thing." Andreas Petersson points out that the whole ecosystem of wallets involved must handle double-spends gracefully to make tx replacement of any kind user-friendly. This approach could make many use cases inconvenient, such as half-offline Bluetooth transactions, users with unstable connections, battery power lost, etc. Lastly, power concerns on hardware wallets on the bitcoincard (tx signing drains a significant amount of power and should therefore only be done once) also need to be addressed.</p>
