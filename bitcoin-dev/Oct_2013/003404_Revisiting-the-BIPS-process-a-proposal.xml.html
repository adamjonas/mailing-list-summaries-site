    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Martin Sustrik, the topic of the relevance of Security Considerations in every RFC for Bitcoin was brought up. Maxwell suggested that conformance or non-conformance with sections 4, 5 and 6 of the specification may be necessary for security as inconsistent behavior in critical parts of the protocol could have catastrophic consequences. In response, Sustrik agreed and stated that all implementations MUST support the current version of the protocol, regardless of whether it has been documented and/or published. He added that publishing the specification is not necessary as it is meant only for informational purposes and is a snapshot of the protocol as of October 22nd, 2013. Finally, Maxwell recommended the use of RFC 6919 keywords for the Bitcoin protocol RFC.</p>
