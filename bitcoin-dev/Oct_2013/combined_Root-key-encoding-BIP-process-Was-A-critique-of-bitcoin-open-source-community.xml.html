        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jean-Paul Kogelman proposed a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) in 2013 regarding base 58 encoding/encryption of BIP 32 root keys. The BIP page stated that BIP numbers should not be added to the list without contacting the Bitcoin community for approval, but Kogelman did not receive a response after contacting the community on Bitcointalk. In July 2013, Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Kogelman's proposal through private messaging and submitted a technical review. Kogelman corrected some misunderstandings and offered to make changes to the specification to clarify some limitations pointed out by Satoshi Nakamoto.Satoshi Nakamoto explained that the reason to go through a serialization point for BIP numbers is to avoid assigning them to things or people's pet ideas that have not been reviewed by or represent any identifiable part of the Bitcoin community. Generally, Satoshi Nakamoto tries not to assign numbers to things before seeing evidence of discussion, which can result in a community outcome. Following this, Satoshi Nakamoto put aside further action on the proposal waiting for Kogelman to make those updates. In October 2013, Kogelman followed up with an indication that he had made some changes addressing Satoshi Nakamoto's points. However, Satoshi Nakamoto missed this due to other obligations and apologized for not responding earlier. Satoshi Nakamoto asked Pieter if he has any opinions to offer on this and generally to the list as well.</p>
