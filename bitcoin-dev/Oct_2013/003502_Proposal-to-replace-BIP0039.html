    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Marek expressed concern over the practicality of using a proposed mnemonic system in embedded devices. The difficulty of generating a proper mnemonic is too high for embedded microcontrollers. Despite this issue, ThomasV's proposal allows for software to have its own preferred wordlist and potentially passphrase protection. However, it is noted that this proposal is one-directional and has a longer mnemonic or longer wordlist compared to bip39, which is bi-directional and has a shorter mnemonic or shorter wordlist. Both proposals have their pros and cons. It remains to be seen if modifications can be made to the proposal to make it more suitable for embedded devices.</p>
