    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In September 2013, multiple users reported an issue with the Bitcoin daemon (bitcoind) not responding to RPC calls without any other suspicious activity in the logs. This problem was reported on various backends, indicating that it wasn't specific to one node. One user wrote a small app that continuously sent three RPC requests every 30 seconds to bitcoind and aborted the connection as soon as it encountered a timeout. The user suspected a lock contention issue with other threads related to the LOCK2(cs_main, pwalletMain->cs_wallet) line of code, although the exact cause of the problem was unknown. Timestamps in traces were suggested as a useful addition for tracking problems.</p>
