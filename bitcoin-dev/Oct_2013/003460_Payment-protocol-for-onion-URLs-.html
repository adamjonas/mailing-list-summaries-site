    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2013, Gregory Maxwell wrote about the limitations of payment protocol as there was no way for a hidden service site to make use of its full authentication capability since they were unable to get SSL certificates issued to them. He suggested packing a tor HS pubkey into a self-signed x509 certificate with the cn set to foooo.onion and specified an additional validation procedure for [base32].onion hosts that just has it hash and base32 encode the pubkey (as tor does) then the payment protocol could work seamlessly with tor hosts. Peter Todd responded with strong agreement on this idea and suggested keeping a copy of Tor URL bookmarks on your second signing computer to make it a genuinely useful tool for multisig wallets too. This would give us a fully supported option which is completely CA free, although it would only work for tor sites.</p>
