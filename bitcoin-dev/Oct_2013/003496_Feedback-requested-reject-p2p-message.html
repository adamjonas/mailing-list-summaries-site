    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email from Mike Hearn on October 27th, 2013, he expressed excitement for a new development that would resolve issues with the current Bitcoinj library. The library had been receiving bug reports about transactions not propagating properly, which caused issues due to the library selecting only one peer to send the transaction to and waiting for it to propagate across the network. If this peer refused the transaction, it would not propagate and cause problems. However, Hearn noted that there needed to be documentation explaining that a failure to reject a transaction did not guarantee its forwarding. Hearn explained that if a node was using priority queued rate limiting for relaying, it could accept a transaction but have it fall out of its memory pool before it had the chance to send it to other peers due to higher priority transactions arriving or getting restarted. While finding out that a transaction had been rejected was still useful information, even assuming all nodes were honest and well-behaved, it was not certain that a transaction would be forwarded without issue.</p>
