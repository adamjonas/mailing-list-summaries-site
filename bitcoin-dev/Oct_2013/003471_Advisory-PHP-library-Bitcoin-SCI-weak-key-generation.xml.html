    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Andres Home in 2013, it was warned that the Bitcoin SCI library had weak key generation. Although there were only two libraries detected with this issue, one being Bitcoin SCI, it was advised for developers to review how their software handles private key creation. The email contained links to the MiniKey function and PrivKey function where the weak functions were mirrored since there was no source control.</p>
