    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Caldwell, who proposed the "Password-protected private key proposal," also known as BIP 38 in late 2012, has requested that the identity of his original proposal be maintained. He has stated that the improvements made by Kogelman to his proposal may be sufficient to supersede what he originally proposed. However, he wants BIP 38 to still be recognized as an existing proposal, so as not to confuse those who call it by its name and who have already chosen to do something with it. Caldwell has also mentioned that if he were to do BIP 38 over again, there are some shortcomings he would like to address in another iteration. These include outsourcing the computationally expensive step to another service with minimized risks to the user, special-purpose "encrypted minikeys," and a typo check with better privacy. Meanwhile, Gregory Maxwell, in response to Caldwell's request, has clarified that prior messages about Caldwell's proposal have never made it to the list, and no mention of the assignment had been made in the wiki. Maxwell had previously created BIP documents without public discussion, and he assumed that Caldwell had done something similar here. He moved the document out after someone complained about bitcoin-qt "not confirming with BIP38" to him. Jean-Paul Kogelman has a draft proposal based on Caldwell's work, though the encoding scheme is different, having been revised in response to public discussion. Maxwell suggests that efforts here can be combined.</p>
