    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The pull-tester has been misbehaving since the autotools merge. Some pull-tester features have been turned off until the issues can be fixed. The pull-tester currently cross-compiles windows binaries, compiles linux binaries, and runs unit tests with binaries compiled on linux. However, running unit tests under wine with cross-compiled windows binaries, running the block-chain-compatibility tester, and computing code coverage are all turned off.In the medium-term, upgrades need to be made to the pull-tester environment. Gavin Andresen recommends upgrading the pull-tester machine from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 or creating a new 12.04 virtual machine and moving the pull-tester over to it. Compilers/dependencies also need to be upgraded based on what will be used for the 0.9 release. Additionally, there needs to be an effort to unify the pull-tester and gitian build processes. It is suggested that the pull-tester should run gitian builds to create binaries (that are then tested against the blockchain tester) or that the pull-tester scripts should be gitian scripts, which the pull-tester machine runs inside an LXC container.</p>
