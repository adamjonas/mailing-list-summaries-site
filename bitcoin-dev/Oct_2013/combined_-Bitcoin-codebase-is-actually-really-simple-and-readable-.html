        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin codebase, written in C++, has been described as simple and readable. However, understanding the implications of the code is anything but simple. The fear that making changes to the code could have catastrophic consequences has hindered efforts to improve documentation and find replacements for obscure names of important items. The difficulty with C++ lies in its design, which makes it hard to achieve readability. Despite this, the reference client's code is considered to be simpler and easier to read than OpenSSL's source-code.Recognizing the need for newcomers to understand the complexities of the cryptocurrency, a developer has proposed the creation of a well-written RFC (Request for Comments) document. Currently, much of the available information about Bitcoin is incomplete and difficult to decipher for those without prior knowledge. However, there are concerns about writing such an RFC due to the consensus nature of the currency.While the code itself may be simple and readable, expressing ideas within the code is challenging due to the constraints of C++. The intentional writing of code for others' understanding becomes particularly difficult when things are designed to be hidden. As a result, efforts to review changes for potential exploits require significant time and effort.In conclusion, while the Bitcoin codebase may appear simple and readable, the implications of the code are complex and difficult to grasp. There is a recognized need for better documentation and resources to aid newcomers in understanding the intricacies of the cryptocurrency. However, the challenges posed by the consensus nature of Bitcoin and the limitations of the C++ language make it difficult to create a well-written RFC document.</p>
