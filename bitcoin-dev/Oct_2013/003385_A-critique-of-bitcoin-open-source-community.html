    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Jean-Paul Kogelman suggests putting Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) into subdirectories that map onto the status of the BIP. Martin Sustrik asks if it has been considered to do this via IETF, but notes that the process can take many years and there may be costs involved. He also mentions that while IETF may be better for standardizing some components, they may not have as much expertise in the field of crypto currencies as the core developers. However, he praises the BIP process as an agile process that strikes a balance between needed features and documentation, and believes it will continue to drive Bitcoinâ€™s momentum in the short to medium term. The discussion ends with a notice about upcoming Intel webinars on code for performance.</p>
