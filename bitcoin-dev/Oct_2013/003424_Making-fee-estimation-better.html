    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and Peter Todd, the latter suggests that miners should advertise in their coinbase what fees were actually paid. However, Hearn argues that some miners may have business models that can't be easily summed up as a "fee". Todd believes that estimation won't force fees down too far if miners include private transactions, because estimates are calculated only on broadcast transactions. Even if a miner is mining a transaction in exchange for an out-of-band fee, they still have an incentive to ask the sender to include enough of a fee that it propagates and broadcast it themselves. Todd wonders under which circumstances a customer would want an exclusive contract with a miner.</p>
