    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of names as a unique identifier for humans to remember and communicate with each other is still prevalent, despite not solving the same problem as sacrifice proof files. However, securely mapping names to public keys would simplify key verification by reducing the need to check larger key fingerprints. A decentralized naming system, such as NameCoin, may come at a high cost. Sacrifice proof files are anonymous identities, making it pointless to attach a name to them. The sacrifice is created using a GUI tool and loaded into a browser extension. The location of a transaction in the blockchain can be encoded in n=log2(h)+log2(t) bits, where h is the block height and t is the number of transactions in the block. A CVC phoneme encodes ~10.7 bits, so a transaction can be located in the blockchain with three of these. Jeff Garzik's identity protocol links a public key fingerprint to a miner sacrifice transaction, which could then be uniquely described with a short name. Lightweight clients check the validity of a sacrifice transaction by verifying its merkle path, which encodes the location of the transaction in the block. Sources of inspiration include urbit.org and the Bitcoin Identity Protocol v1. Some examples of random names include milmoz-vyrnyx, mypnoz-fojzas, sawfex-bovlec, fidhut-guvgis, bobfej-jessuk, furcos-diwhuw, wokryx-wilrox, bygbyl-caggos, vewcyv-jyjsal, and daxsaf-cywkul.</p>
