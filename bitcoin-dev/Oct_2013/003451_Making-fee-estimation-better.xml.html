    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated October 25, 2013, Jeremy Spilman inquired about fee estimation changes for v0.9 and asked for the best place to read up on it. He viewed fee estimation as providing a data point or API that could be used as desired. He listed parameters he would like to see included in the API such as processing time and confidence levels. Spilman also asked about reading more on leading theories regarding transaction fees including their correlation with network security. In response, Peter Todd explained that network security is currently funded by inflation rather than transaction fees and provided a link showing the cost of security per transaction to be around $18. Finally, Todd cautioned that state-of-the-art thinking had changed significantly since a document Gavin Andresen had written over a year ago and that it would need significant updates.</p>
