    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 10, 2013, Warren Togami Jr. announced a branch of Bitcoin 0.8.5 with sipa's secp256k1. Litecoin had already shipped test builds with secp256k1 for several months. This branch was built to make it work with the old 0.8 makefiles without intent for production code merge. Cfields was working on autotoolizing it as one of the prerequisites prior to inclusion into bitcoin master where it would be an option disabled by default. An untested win32 gitian build was available, but it was not recommended for production wallet or mining uses.In response to this announcement, someone in #bitcoin-dev asked for Bitcoin 0.8.5 with sipa's secp256k1. The library was optimized ecdsa and significantly faster than OpenSSL. The main issue at the moment was the malleability issues. It was suggested that OpenSSL could be used to parse the signature into components and then libsecp256k1 to verify them. Lastly, the October webinars were announced. Free Intel webinars can help accelerate application performance. Tips for MPI, OpenMP, advanced profiling, and more were explored. Participants were encouraged to get the most from the latest Intel processors and coprocessors.</p>
