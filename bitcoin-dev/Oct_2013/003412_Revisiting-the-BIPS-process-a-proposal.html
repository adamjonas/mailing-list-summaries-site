    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion, Peter Todd emphasized that the reference implementation of a specification is the actual specification itself and the information posted on wiki pages are merely simplified notes. He advised anyone who was having trouble understanding this to assume that the protocol is fixed and unchanging. However, Martin Sustrik questioned whether or not these notes were intentionally vague in order to force people to check the source code. Todd explained that the information on the wiki was primarily contributed by individuals who were not involved in the development of the reference implementation and therefore, cannot be deemed as deliberately obscure.</p>
