    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Jean-Paul Kogelman and Peter Todd on October 20, 2013, the former asked if it would be possible to create an area where proposals like NODE_BLOOM and BIP 38 could live. Todd suggested the idea of subdirectories within the repository that map onto the status of the BIP, which would include Accepted, Active, Draft, Deferred, Final, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn. He also mentioned that Jeff had already proposed the idea of a specific drafts/ directory or rejected/ directory for such proposals. Todd acknowledged that it is less of an issue when everything is in git - people can just be directed to their bips fork.</p>
