    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of BIP 0038 is seeking help to confirm a recent change made on the Wiki regarding their proposal. The change suggests that the number was never assigned and there has been no discussion regarding the proposal on this list; however, the author states that they had the number assigned in November of 2012. They are asking for confirmation that their messages are getting through to the list and if not, requesting help to push forward the proposal. BIP 0038 allows people to create private keys protected by a password and is seeing real-world use including implementation by BitAddress.org, Bit2Factor.org and Mycelium. The author believes it would be confusing to reassign the number after already having an established meaning for the better part of a year, particularly on procedural grounds.</p>
