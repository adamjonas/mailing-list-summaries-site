    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread in 2013, a contributor named Mitar shared an interesting read from the Berkeley School of Information, which prompted discussion about Bitcoin's development community. The conversation touched on newcomer experience and potential issues with communication and transparency. One specific complaint was regarding a lack of introductory materials for new contributors, which could be addressed by improving resources on bitcoin.org/en/development. Another concern was that #bitcoin-dev IRC channel participants were discussing off-topic and potentially hostile content, which is something that needs to be addressed to encourage more productive discussions. Additionally, some pull requests were left unaddressed for long periods of time due to shortages of active review and prioritization of safety-critical changes. The contributor who raised these concerns, Nick Merrill, also made inaccurate claims about contributors hiding their identities and the programming language used to write Bitcoin's core code. Overall, the conversation highlighted the need for better communication and support for newcomers in the Bitcoin development community.</p>
