    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2013, a proposal was made regarding changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. The proposal was posted on a mailing list and received limited response. One individual responded on Bitcointalk (BCT), suggesting that the proposal should be discussed further on the mailing list. However, since there was not much discussion, this individual reviewed the proposal and posted their technical review on the forum. In hindsight, they realized that they should have also posted their review on the mailing list in order to spark additional discussion. The mailing list is the initial platform for proposals to be submitted and discussed before being implemented.</p>
