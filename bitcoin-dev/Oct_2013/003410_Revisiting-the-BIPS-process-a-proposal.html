    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the process of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) writing, Jeff Garzik suggests that adding burdensome processes should be avoided to prevent discouragement. He proposes a distributed approach where anyone who feels a draft needs improvement can submit a pull request and help community-edit the document. Martin Sustrik expresses interest in participating but is concerned that the spec is deliberately vague to force compatibility with the reference implementation rather than with a document. Peter Todd explains that the reference implementation is the actual specification, while the one on the wiki is more like Coles Notes. He advises those who don't understand this to assume that the protocol is fixed and doesn't evolve much. Todd also mentions the need for a "Developers" section in the FAQ to explain these concepts.</p>
