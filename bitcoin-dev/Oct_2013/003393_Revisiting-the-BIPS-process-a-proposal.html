    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik proposed a revision of the BIPS process that has become a bit disorganized. He suggested that BIPS should move back to git and be hash-sealed against corruption. However, requiring a git pull request might discourage some contributors. The new process he suggested is modeled after IETF drafts. Anyone may submit a BIP draft as long as it meets two loose requirements: somewhat related to Bitcoin and formatted similarly to existing BIPs. The BIP drafts can be submitted via git pull request or by emailing an attachment to bips.editor at bitcoin.org. BIP drafts are stored in git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/ and are not automatically assigned a BIPS number. If interest and use cases remain strong, a BIP number may be requested, and the BIP draft is moved to git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git main directory. If there is general consensus that the BIP should be adopted, the BIP status is changed to "accepted." There are no specified time limits for this process as sometimes consensus about a BIP is reached in days, sometimes 12+ months or more, depending on the feature's complexity and impact.The goal is to improve the process, hash-seal the specs, and create an easy way for anyone with at least an email address to participate. The current BIP-number-assigner-in-chief is gmaxwell who is also the BIP editor. Jeff Garzik is happy with gmaxwell as the BIP editor too.</p>
