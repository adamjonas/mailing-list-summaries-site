    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has proposed that Bitcoin needs a well-written RFC document to help newcomers understand the complexities of the cryptocurrency. Currently, much of the information available is incomplete and difficult to decipher for those without prior knowledge of Bitcoin. However, there are concerns about writing such an RFC due to the consensus nature of the currency. The codebase of Bitcoin has been described as simple and readable, but the implications of the code are anything but simple. The language (C++) used to write it is seen as hindering the expression of ideas in the code, thus reducing readability. Intentionally writing code so that others may understand it is difficult in C++, where things are designed to be hidden.</p>
