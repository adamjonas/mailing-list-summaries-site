    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named "slush" has reported a problem with version 0.8.2 of Bitcoin, which is still occurring in the latest version 0.8.5. Another user has also experienced this issue and notes that it does not occur in version 0.8.1. The issue involves hitting the '4 keep alive thread limit,' which prevents other clients from connecting to the server. Although this was resolved, there is still an issue with RPC hanging. The most problematic aspect of this issue appears to be using 'getwork,' which may become obsolete in the future.</p>
