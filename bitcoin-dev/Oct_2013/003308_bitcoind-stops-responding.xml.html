    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Warren Togami Jr. and Jeff Garzik, it was brought up that 0.8.2 was the first Bitcoin version to support RPC keepalive, which was refuted by Jeff as he claimed RPC keepalive was present in 0.7.0 or possibly even earlier. Jeff went on to note that the 21eb5ada commit introduced a 4 RPC thread limit, which could exhaust all four and prevent further connections. However, this commit also introduced buggy behavior that did not exist with the thread-per-connection code that provided keep-alive before the commit. Jeff believed that the commit half-changed the RPC code from thread-per-connection to a worker-group model without considering all the consequences.
