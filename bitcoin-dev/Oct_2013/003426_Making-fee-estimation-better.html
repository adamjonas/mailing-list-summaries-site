    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discuss the idea of miners having exclusive contracts with customers for transaction mining. Mike suggests that since all miners are supposed to be equivalent, issues arising from out of bad fee mechanisms not getting mined should not be common. However, Eligius currently has contracts for transaction mining and controls 10% of hashing power. Peter Todd suggests that customers may want exclusive contracts for transactions that aren't standard and need to be submitted directly to miners. Mike agrees but also notes that letting more than one miner know about such transactions is not harmful. Additionally, P2Pool already allows shares to be accompanied by up to 50KB worth of transactions of any form.</p>
