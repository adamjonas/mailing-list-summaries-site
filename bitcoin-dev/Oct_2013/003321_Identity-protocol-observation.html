    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the use of a sacrifice as an anonymous identity, with no need for names. The sacrifice is created using an app and loaded into a browser for surfing. A decentralized naming system, NameCoin, is mentioned, but it is argued that it comes at great cost due to the need for the whole blockchain to resolve names without trust. Instead, the sacrifice system is proposed as a simple, rudimentary system that scales on any device and is good enough for the types of people who might care about decentralized names. The sacrifice can be described with a short name, which encodes the location of the transaction in the block, so the lightweight client can verify the sacrifice tx's short name using only the information he already has. Phonemes are used to encode the location of the transaction in the blockchain, with three phonemes being sufficient to provide a reasonably short, readable, and memorable name. Examples of such names are provided. The sacrifice file is created using a GUI tool and loaded into a browser extension.</p>
