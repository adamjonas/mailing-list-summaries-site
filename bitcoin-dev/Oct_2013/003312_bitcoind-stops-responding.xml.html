    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a test, Olivier Langlois identified that the locks were being held for a long time due to lock contention with other threads. He modified bitcoinrpc.cpp and added code to print execution times. The code was added to check network activity during calls with 5.99 locktime, whether bitcoind was processing a block or sending a large transaction. A large number of locktime and calltime values were printed in response to this modification. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, received this email and forwarded it to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
