    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In October 2013, Gregory Maxwell raised a concern about the limitations of the payment protocol as specified. He stated that hidden service sites were unable to make use of its full authentication capability due to the inability to receive SSL certificates. A tor hidden service is controlled by an RSA key, and Maxwell proposed a solution of packing a tor HS pubkey into a self-signed x509 certificate with the cn set to foooo.onion. Luke asked if there was any point in additional encryption over Tor, which is already encrypted end-to-end. He also questioned whether there was a safe way to make this work through Tor entry nodes/gateways. Finally, Luke expressed interest in having a way to support namecoin-provided keys too.</p>
