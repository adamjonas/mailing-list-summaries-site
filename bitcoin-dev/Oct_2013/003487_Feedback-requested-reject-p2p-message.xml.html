    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-development mailing list in 2013, Gavin Andresen proposed adding new reject codes for the Bitcoin protocol. He suggested using categories to organize the codes, with 0x01-0x0f for syntax errors, 0x10-0x1f for semantic errors, and 0x40-0x4f for server policy rules. Some specific suggestions were made, such as using 0x40 for "non-standard transaction type" rather than "unknown transaction type". There was also debate about whether to have separate codes for different versions of blocks and transactions. However, there was agreement that using HTTP codes directly would not be a good fit for the Bitcoin protocol, and that using varints for reject codes was unnecessary since it was unlikely that more than sixteen would ever be needed.</p>
