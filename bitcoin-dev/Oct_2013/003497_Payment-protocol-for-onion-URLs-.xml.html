    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Jeremy Spilman discusses the risks of reusing keys for signing and notes that it is bad form to do so. He suggests that John should have gotten separate public keys for the purpose of his bounty, rather than placing demands on people who haven't consented. Disambiguating bounties was also discussed, with the issue being that if further funds are sent to the bounty address, it's unclear how to handle those funds. The possibility of creating a Python script to do signature accumulation and signing was mentioned, but there hasn't been much demand yet to fully polish UIs. It was noted that blockchain.info had added multisig escrow support in the past but removed it due to near-zero usage.</p>
