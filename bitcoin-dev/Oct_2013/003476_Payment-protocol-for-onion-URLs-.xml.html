    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from October 2013, Gregory Maxwell raised a concern about the limitation of the payment protocol. He stated that there was no way for a hidden service site to make use of its full authentication capability because they are unable to get SSL certificates issued to them. In response to this, someone offered 1BTC as a reward to anyone who could solve this issue. The reward can be redeemed using the given Bitcoin address and redeem script. It was suggested that Jeff Garzik or Peter Todd could evaluate the finished product, or possibly someone else.</p>
