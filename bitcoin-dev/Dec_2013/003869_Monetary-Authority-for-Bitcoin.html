    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation at hand revolves around a proposal to allow miners to choose which exchanges to track for the purpose of adjusting the block reward. Jameson Lopp voices concerns that any proposal relying on data from third-party sources outside of the Bitcoin network would likely be rejected outright as it opens up too many potential vulnerabilities. He also points out that there must be consensus between miners, or else a solved block will be rejected by the miner's peers. Jeff Garzik mocks the proposal and Ryan Carboni argues that it would not violate the trust of those holding the currency. The conversation ends with a sponsored message from Intel(R) XDK promoting their app development tool.</p>
