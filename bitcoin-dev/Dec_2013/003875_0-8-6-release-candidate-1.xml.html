    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Roy Badami and Wladimir, it was discussed that the final release of a certain project was not announced on a mailing list. Roy inquired if there was another list he needed to be on and suggested that announcements like this should be posted to a mailing list as well as bitcointalk.org. Wladimir agreed that it could have been announced on the mailing list and suggested adding a list of places to announce to the release process.</p>
