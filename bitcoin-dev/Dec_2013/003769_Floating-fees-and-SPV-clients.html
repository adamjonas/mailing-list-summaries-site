    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is sceptical about putting the minimum fee in the hands of the receiver, as this could end up working against the interests of senders in the long run. They suggest an alternative approach to calculating the minimum fee, which involves analysing the last 2016 blocks to find the average fee accepted per kb. This figure, inclusive of transactions that were included without fees, would be written into the block as a soft recommendation for wallets to use in their UI. The price would then vary according to what people were willing to spend on fees and miners willing to accept. The writer does not trust vendors to set fees; instead, they propose that fees should be based on what senders are willing to pay, and what miners are willing to accept.</p>
