    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the ownership and administration of a server for the Bitcoin.org website, Gavin Andresen expressed concern over the lack of clarity regarding who would be responsible for keeping it secure. He stated that it was important for the server to be owned by someone trustworthy and suggested that the Bitcoin Foundation could potentially take on this responsibility. However, he also noted that he personally did not have the capacity to manage the server and encouraged others to create a new organization if they wished to take on the task.</p>
