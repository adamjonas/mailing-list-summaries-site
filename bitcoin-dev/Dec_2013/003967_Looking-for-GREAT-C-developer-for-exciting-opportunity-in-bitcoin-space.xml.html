    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email from Evan Duffield, a startup founder, seeking C++ programmers familiar with Bitcoin internals to help with a for-profit project has sparked controversy. Many people on the Bitcoin-development mailing list have criticized the idea as being backed by greedy "entrepreneurs" who do not understand the system they are trying to improve. The project is described as a merge-mined altcoin that will provide a useful service to the whole crypto-coin ecosystem. However, more information about the project will only be provided after signing a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement. The email also requests applicants to include information about any features they have added to Bitcoin or related technologies. The email ends with contact information for interested parties to email Evan and Kyle at Hawk Financial Group LLC. In addition to this email, there is an advertisement for AppDynamics, which offers IT organizations 100% visibility into their Java, .NET, and PHP application performance. The ad includes a link for a 15-day free trial of AppDynamics Pro. Overall, the email from Evan Duffield seeking C++ programmers has raised concerns among members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list. While the project is described as a merge-mined altcoin that will provide a useful service, many believe it is backed by greedy entrepreneurs who lack understanding of the system they are trying to improve. The email also requests applicants to sign a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement before providing more information about the project.</p>
