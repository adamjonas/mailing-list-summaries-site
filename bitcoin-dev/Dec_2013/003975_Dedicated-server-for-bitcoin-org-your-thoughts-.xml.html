    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of SSL for downloads and whether or not they are protected by anything came up in a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. While SSL can raise the bar, it cannot lower it. The problem is that getting SSL would require funding from the community since sites such as Github and SourceForge offer free hosting, but no SSL. There is also concern about moving to different hosting companies due to controversy. The issue of the NSA being able to change every download of bitcoin-qt on the fly was brought up, but it was argued that actual signatures of the downloads with offline keys provide stronger protection than SSL. There is a need for a better sense of security without producing a false sense of security.</p>
