    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread is about a suggestion made by Ryan Carboni to implement a sanity check in Bitcoin. Carboni proposed that after three days and only four blocks have been mined, the difficulty should be adjusted downwards. Mark Friedenbach responded by pointing out that such adjustments could introduce security risks and that there are alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms being explored by some alts. Allen Piscitello weighed in on the conversation, questioning why Ryan Carboni continues to try to correct people who clearly have put more thought into this than him. He also accused Carboni of having trouble comprehending why his ideas are terrible. Carboni had suggested that the safest way to run Bitcoin is through a proprietary dial-up network.</p>
