    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about Bitcoin transaction fees. Drak raises a concern that if a merchant sets a fee, they have no idea how large the transaction might be. Thus, if someone spends a lot of dust, the fee could be 2 or 3 times the expected fee and merchants may include higher fees by default to account for this. Peter Todd suggests requiring a fee-per-kb and only allowing up to a certain amount to be deducted from the amount paid to pay that total fee. However, he also argues that leaving fees visible to the user in the first place would be better because they are how Bitcoin works and it's not going to change.</p>
