    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on Bitcoin fees has led to the conclusion that making it fee-per-kilobyte is a bad idea as users do not care about how many kilobytes their transactions are. This would just lead to confusion among users, especially if they were asked to pay different amounts for the same transaction. However, for person-to-business transactions, it may be acceptable for the receiver to receive less than requested. In the long run, buying things from shops could involve paying fees while person-to-person transactions tend to be free. Therefore, keeping fees visible to end-users is an excellent argument for person-to-person payments in Bitcoin. Furthermore, NAK on unconfirmed overrides is important to avoid any accidental problems and make fixing them easier.</p>
