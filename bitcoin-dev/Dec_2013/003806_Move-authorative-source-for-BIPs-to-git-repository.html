    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion about BIP documents storage is being recycled and the previous discussion should be reviewed before the same questions are asked again. The hurdles can be reduced by using a process where the BIPS Editor would receive an email, and could take it from there. More advanced users may submit pull requests. The wiki is considered to be second class compared to a hash-sealed git repo as primary source for storing BIP documents. A suggestion was made to replace the BIPs on the wiki with links to github documents, with a notice that changes should be proposed on github or mailed to the BIP editor. However, Luke-Jr thinks that this would stifle active BIP draft editing. He believes that bigger hurdles should not be put up as some developers are already having a hard time writing BIPs for their proposals.
