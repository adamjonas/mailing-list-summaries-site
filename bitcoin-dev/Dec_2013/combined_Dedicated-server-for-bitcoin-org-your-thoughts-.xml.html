        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal was made by Jeremy Spilman to provide forward-validation of updates using the blockchain. This approach would enable trusted automatic update notification and a trusted way to deliver the expected hashes, making it easier for wallets to detect updates and prove their validity. The current system for secure updating, gitian-downloader, is already in place but not utilized; making actual gitian releases would enable anyone to verify signatures of downloads. While SSL is an option, Drak argues that actual signatures of downloads with offline keys provide stronger protection than SSL, which only produces false security.The discussion revolves around the security of Bitcoin.org and its control. There is a debate on whether or not to use SSL certificates for protection against MITM attacks, which some argue can be circumvented with BGP redirection. However, others argue that SSL provides encryption and identity verification, thwarts MITM attacks, and protects users from attackers who actively intercept traffic to the server. The use of SSL certificates is also expected and can reduce people's insecurity. Nevertheless, it is noted that SSL hardly does anything to reduce the need to check offline signatures on binaries.It is suggested that simple verification relies on answering emails sent to the person in the whois records to prove ownership of a domain, but as pointed out, many CAs are verified from nothing other than an HTTP fetch, no email involved. Moreover, several CAs will issue a certificate to anyone who can make an HTTP page appear at a specific URL at the domain when requested via the CA over HTTP. It is observed that there is a concern regarding the control of Bitcoin and that independence is critical. In terms of effective lobbying/advocacy, it is felt that the foundation would be unable to do an effective job if it is saddled with the belief that it is in control of Bitcoin.A well-known address on the blockchain corresponding to multi-sig with keys controlled by developers would announce a new release, including the expected hash of the file. A more rigorous approach could identify all the various releases in terms of a BIP32 xpubkey whose branches would correspond to the different release trains and platform builds. Spends from a node would announce the release and the expected hash. Trusting someone or handing the keys to the Bitcoin project lead may be a solution, but the concern is about too many eggs in one basket.Finally, it is acknowledged that the site was moved onto a dedicated server temporarily, but it melted down under the load.</p>
