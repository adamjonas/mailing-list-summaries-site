    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In December 2013, Evan Duffield, the founder of the startup Hawk Financial Group, LLC, posted an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list seeking one or two skilled C++ programmers familiar with Bitcoin internals to help with a for-profit startup. The project involved creating a merge-mined altcoin that would provide a unique service to the whole crypto-coin ecosystem. They promised to provide more information about the project after signing a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement. Jeremie, a long-time follower of bitcoin-development, responded to Duffield's email expressing concerns that such emails would hijack the list and cause true discussions between core-devs to move elsewhere on a less public channel, where people like him would not be able to follow them anymore. He believed that such emails were irrelevant and described them as spam. Duffield's email requested interested applicants to email him at eduffield82@gmail.com with a description of their work experience, and they would vet the applications and share their plans to see if the applicants were interested. Duffield and Kyle were looking to fill specific roles and preferred candidates who had added features to Bitcoin or related technologies.</p>
