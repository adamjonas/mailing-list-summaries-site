        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On the forum post of Bitcointalk.org, a user suggested that it would be beneficial to have Bitcoin run on Fedora 20 or higher without any additional setup. The poster expressed their desire to see this functionality implemented. This suggestion has received attention as it could potentially simplify the process for users to run Bitcoin on Fedora 20 or higher.It is worth noting that currently, there are no known issues with running Bitcoin on Fedora 20 or higher, but some additional setup may be required. However, if Bitcoin were to be integrated into the operating system without any need for additional setup, it would streamline the process and make it more accessible to users.Overall, the suggestion made on Bitcointalk.org highlights the potential benefits of integrating Bitcoin into Fedora 20 or higher without any additional setup. It remains to be seen whether this functionality will be implemented, but it could ultimately make it easier for users to run Bitcoin on these operating systems.</p>
