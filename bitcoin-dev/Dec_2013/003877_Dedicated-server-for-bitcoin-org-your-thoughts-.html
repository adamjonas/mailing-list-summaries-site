    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was initiated on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the control over the bitcoin.org domain. Drak suggested that control over the domain needs to be with more than one person for robustness, in case of unavailability or any other unforeseen circumstance. The current control over the domain is with theymos, Sirius, and an anonymous person, which ensures that control will not be lost if any one of them becomes unavailable. Theymos also suggested that it might be a good idea to separate bitcoin.org from Github, as he does not fully trust Github. Odinn joined the conversation to thank theymos and express support for decentralization. He also provided a link to his latest project, ABIS. Additionally, the conversation included a sponsored message from Intel(R) XDK promoting their software for developing web and hybrid apps.</p>
