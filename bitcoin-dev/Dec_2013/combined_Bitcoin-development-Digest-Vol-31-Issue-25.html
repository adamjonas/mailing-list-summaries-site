        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation revolves around the possibility of changing Bitcoin's inflation parameters and its impact on the economy. There is a suggestion that if such a change were to become necessary, merchants would vote for a new altcoin that reflects the consensus on inflation rather than changing Bitcoin itself. However, it is noted that adding a monetary authority to Bitcoin would be impossible and undesirable as it goes against the implicit contract of Bitcoin being unchangeable.It is also mentioned that the value of Bitcoin fluctuates greatly, making it difficult to use for daily transactions. While it may be difficult for an altcoin to gain acceptance due to the existing infrastructure for Bitcoin, the proposal is believed to make sound economic sense and be the only way to fix the speculation crisis. The economic parameters of Bitcoin are not fixed in stone and if a change becomes necessary, it will be messy but possible.Ryan Carboni expresses his belief in the possibility of changing the economic parameters of Bitcoin, stating that although deflation will still be possible under his proposal, Austrian-defined inflation is occurring within Bitcoin at a faster rate than desired. He suggests those who disagree with him read up on how the system works and why the argument from authority is rejected. Carboni's comments were made on a mailing list not intended for political discussions and he was advised to take his proposal to a proper venue, such as the bitcointalk.org forums where similar proposals have been discussed.</p>
