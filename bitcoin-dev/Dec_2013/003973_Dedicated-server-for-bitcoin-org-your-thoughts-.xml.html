    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The NSA has the capability to "beat the speed of light" between a user and a website, allowing them to send competing packets that arrive before the intended packets. They also have real-time deep packet insertion ability, enabling them to inject arbitrary data into TCP streams and change file downloads on the fly, all done remotely. As a result, it is recommended that downloads be moved to websites such as Github that provide HTTPS downloads. The presentation also revealed that if the NSA has access to these capabilities, then others likely do as well, making encryption the only effective solution. It was discovered that one of the things revealed in the presentation had already been independently discovered and published. The speaker highlights the irony of disseminating the bitcoin cryptocurrency client in the clear and recommends installing an SSL certificate and redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The video linked in the context showcases the extent of the NSA's current capabilities, which go beyond anything imaginable even in science fiction.</p>
