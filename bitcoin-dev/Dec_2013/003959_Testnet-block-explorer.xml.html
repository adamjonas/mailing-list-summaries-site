    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eric has created a shell around the bitcoind JSON-RPC, along with a websockets server that offers real-time transaction and block feeds. This can be used on bitcoin mainnet and testnet as well as any alt chains. The output is similar to blockchain.info with the bootstrap look-and-feel. Eric's goal was simplicity in deployment to a new server. However, the JSON-RPC is missing "address indexing" and an "unspent" API. Mike Belshe suggests two more testnet explorers, but they both lack an "unspent" API for getting unspent values for an address. Mike Hearn introduces a new block explorer for testnet, built using bitcoinj, which comes with a REST/JSON API, however, it sorts transactions by "time received".</p>
