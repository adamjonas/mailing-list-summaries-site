    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on December 19, 2013, Peter Todd discussed several important aspects of Bitcoin wallet security. He emphasized that wallets must allow users to set their own fees per KB for transactions and should also enable users to change fees after the fact through transaction replacement. He also suggested that wallets should warn users if the fee is unusually high to avoid sending large amounts of Bitcoin as fees. The discussion then moved on to SSL/Certificate authorities, with Todd suggesting that website owners should use https instead of http when advertising their software. He also recommended publishing valid certificate fingerprints and which CA signed them as a way to expose MITM attacks. Regarding multi-factor spend authorization, Todd opined that it was risky to assume any individual device was uncompromised. He suggested that wallet software should support some form of multi-factor protection for some or all wallet funds.</p>
