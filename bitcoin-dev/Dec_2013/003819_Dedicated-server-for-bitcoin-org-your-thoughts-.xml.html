    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Saïvann Carignan, in an email dated December 08, 2013, discussed the issue of sourceforge not being encrypted. However, he mentioned that encryption is useless here for binaries downloading as they want everyone to have access to Bitcoin client. Binaries on sourceforge are signed by multiple parties using gitian. The issue of decentralization was also discussed where Saïvann Carignan said that even though the content can be forked on GitHub, the website is centralized as long as it uses DNS. To solve this issue, a dedicated server would be required that accepts commands only when signed by N-of-M parties, inside a cage locked by padlocks with keys held by independent parties, with an SSL certificate issued by an authority that has multiple parties watch it every step of the way into that server.</p>
