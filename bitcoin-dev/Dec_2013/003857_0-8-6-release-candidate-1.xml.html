    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When Drak asked why a particular software was made available for download on sourceforge.net if it wasn't actually released, the response was that it takes time to put the files up, propagate them to mirrors, and ensure that downloads work and signatures pass. The person responding noted that every release comes with an announcement, so users would know when a release is truly out. They also argued against hiding files in the release pipeline, which could limit public participation in the release workflow.</p>
