    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the integration of BIP32 and BIP70, two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that deal with address generation and payment protocol, respectively. The proposal suggests adding an additional xpubkey and iteration count field to each output script for improved privacy. However, this requires a backwards incompatible change to the protocol. The author wonders if a last minute change to BIP70 could be made before wallets ship and merchant support begins. Another email in the thread suggests encouraging the use of "super addresses" from BIP32 for increased privacy. These would fit well into BIP70's PaymentDetails message, which allows for multiple outputs. The email also suggests upgrading the refund_to address to a "super address". The article linked in one of the emails elaborates on various privacy features in the payment protocol, including the ability to request multiple outputs and submit multiple transactions, as well as the use of SSL for P2P connections.</p>
