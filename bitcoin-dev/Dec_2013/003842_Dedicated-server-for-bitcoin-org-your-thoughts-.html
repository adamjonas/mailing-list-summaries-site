    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread from December 8, 2013, Sa√Øvann Carignan raised several questions about the funding, administration, and DNS control of the bitcoin.org website. While some suggested that the Bitcoin Foundation should fund the website due to its proximity to the bitcoin community, Carignan expressed interest in finding an alternate way to fund it but wanted feedback from developers first. In terms of administration, Carignan believed that the server should be owned by someone trustworthy with SSH access for core developers. However, opinions were mixed on who should control the DNS, with some suggesting that only those involved in necessary roles should have access. Ultimately, it was determined that developers should not necessarily be directly involved in web or server admin tasks.</p>
