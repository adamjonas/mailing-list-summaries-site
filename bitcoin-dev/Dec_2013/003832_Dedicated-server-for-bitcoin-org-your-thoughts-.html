    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread from 2013, Drak expressed concerns about trusting any individual or group with control over the Bitcoin project. He suggested handing over the keys to the project lead or identifying individuals with admin rights on code projects such as GitHub and SourceForge who had already proven their trustworthiness. However, another participant in the conversation pointed out that the concern was not about trust but rather having too many important elements of the project under one entity's control. This could potentially create jurisdictional issues and impede effective lobbying and advocacy efforts. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin was emphasized, and it was suggested that diversifying control over popular infrastructure would be beneficial for its users. The topic of funding for servers was also discussed, with the suggestion that individuals could pay for it themselves if necessary.</p>
