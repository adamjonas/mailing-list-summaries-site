        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-qt client makes it easy for users to backup their wallet.dat files, but restoring them can be a complicated process. To restore the backup, the user must copy the file to the correct folder and execute "bitcoin-qt -rescan". The author of a post on bitcoin-user suggests that this is part of a larger user experience problem with bitcoin-qt and proposes a document-oriented approach to wallets. This would allow users to select a location to store their wallet, open the most recent wallet when running the program, and enable them to open a wallet by double-clicking it directly in the OS.While this may bring other considerations such as multiple wallets being open at the same time, moving wallet files while open, and needing to backup wallets periodically, it would be a big enough usability win to consider. Additionally, adopting BIP 32 style deterministically derived private keys from a single seed would eliminate some of these issues. The author believes that if we want more people to use bitcoin, operations like wallet backups and restores need to be made as easy as possible.The author also suggests that the bitcoin-qt developers could implement an easier way to restore the wallet, such as adding an option in the File menu called "Restore Wallet" or "Recover Wallet". This would show a dialog asking for the backup file and everything would be done automatically, making the process less manual and more user-friendly. The author's message was originally posted on bitcoin-user, but received no replies.</p>
