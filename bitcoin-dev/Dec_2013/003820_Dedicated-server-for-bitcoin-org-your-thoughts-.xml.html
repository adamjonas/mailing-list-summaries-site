    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post made by Drak on December 8, 2013 at 10:00:35 AM, he suggested that it was time to host the Bitcoin Qt software on Github. He cited Github's releases feature which allowed users to upload packaged releases without any advertisements or privacy leaks. Additionally, many people felt that Github was more trustworthy than SourceForge and it made sense to have downloads where the source code was developed. However, Luke expressed his lack of knowledge regarding any rational basis for trusting Github more than SourceForge. He pointed out that at least SourceForge was transparent in releasing their source code.</p>
