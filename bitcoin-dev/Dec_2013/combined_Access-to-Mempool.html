        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Nodes can use commands to access a peer's mempool state and request the contents of their memory pool. This feature is currently used by SPV clients to find transactions that were broadcast before they were started up but not yet confirmed. Recovering faster after a reboot is possible by reading a peer's mempool or persisting the mempool in a database locally. However, it is unclear what information can be gained about a node from its mempool, and whether there are any distinguishing features that can be observed.The contents of the mempool may vary depending on when the node was started and what it saw at what times, which could be distinguishing in a way, but not in any important way. Normally, if a transaction is in the mempool, it will be relayed unless there are quirks to do with sendrawtransaction RPCs or strangely crafted wallet spends. It is unknown whether there are transactions that can be received into one's own mempool but not forwarded, or if 'nLockTime' transactions play a role. The status of this new feature is unclear, as well as which clients support it.In addition, the author asks if there are recommended sources to compare the features implemented by different wallet software. Although there are tables compiled somewhere, there is no recommended place to compare these features. In conclusion, accessing a peer's mempool state can allow for faster recovery after a reboot, but it remains unclear what information can be gained from it and how it can be used effectively.</p>
