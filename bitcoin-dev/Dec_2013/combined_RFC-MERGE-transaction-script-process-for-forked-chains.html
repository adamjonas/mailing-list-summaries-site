        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The concept of merging forks in distributed version control systems for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is being discussed. The idea is that local miners could facilitate trading until the connection to the internet is restored. Merge transactions would be used, where a miner looks at a forked blockchain and includes both chains if no double-spends exist. However, merge conflicts can arise in case of a buggy client or a double-spend transaction, requiring human intervention. A MERGE request with a transaction fee sufficient to cover reconciling the double-spends would be broadcasted to incentivize miners to do extra work to merge.In an email thread from 2013, Troy Benjegerdes expressed his interest in receiving feedback on merging forks using distributed version control systems. The system already automatically merges forks by pulling in all novel non-conflicting transactions and including them in the next blocks. Transactions can be traded offline as long as there are no secretly double-spending coins that are sent to the Blockchain. If any merge conflict arises, a MERGE request with a transaction fee sufficient to cover reconciling the double-spends would be broadcasted to incentivize miners to do extra work to merge. The discussion then turned to the hard upper limit for the number of coins in Bitcoin, which raises issues for miners who try to support an islanded network. A potential solution is using freicoin-like demurrage, which would impact new coinbase based on the percentage of hashing power on the other side of the fork. This proposal is complex and not as secure or reliable as initially imagined. There is also concern about the incentives of the proposal, as it may give miners reasons to avoid including transactions and people reason to double-spend.In summary, merging forks in distributed version control systems for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is being discussed. Merge transactions would be used, and a MERGE request with a transaction fee sufficient to cover reconciling double-spends would be broadcasted to incentivize miners to merge. The discussion also addressed issues related to the hard upper limit for the number of coins in Bitcoin and the use of freicoin-like demurrage as a potential solution. There were concerns about the incentives of the proposal and its overall security and reliability.</p>
