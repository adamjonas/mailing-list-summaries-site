    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email, a person named Saïvann suggested moving bitcoin.org to a dedicated server with an SSL certificate. This idea has been discussed before in various forums, including bitcointalk.org. In a blog post from August 2013, there were concerns about CA related issues with bitcoin.org and the lack of encryption on the site. The post mentioned that DigiCert could revoke a certificate for various reasons, including if the private key was compromised or if the applicant is added to a government list of prohibited persons or entities. Currently, bitcoin.org shows as not verified and not encrypted when examined cursorily with Chrome. There are suggestions for further decentralizing bitcoin.org content and using Tahoe-LAFS and .bit stuff (namecoin). It's unknown how many mirrors there are of bitcoin.org. Some people have discussed mirroring specific content in the past. Saïvann is considering the idea of moving bitcoin.org to a dedicated server with an SSL certificate more seriously, but they would like feedback before taking any steps.</p>
