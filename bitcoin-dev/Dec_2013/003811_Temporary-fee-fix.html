    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 6, 2013, Andreas Petersson proposed a suggestion to lower the minimum relay fee per kb to something less than the current fixed fee of 0.1 mBTC, until a new fee market is established. This proposal was considered but deemed too risky for version 0.8.6 of Bitcoin. It was decided that this change will be implemented in version 0.9, unless the full floating fee implementation is ready and considered safe by then. The current high fixed fee has received criticism from users, with some Play Store reviews of Mycelium mentioning it as a negative aspect. Banks have been noted to sometimes have lower fees than Bitcoin's current fee structure.</p>
