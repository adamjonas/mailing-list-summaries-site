    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin.org website is currently hosted on GitHub, which some members of the Bitcoin community feel is not ideal. One issue that needs to be resolved is who will pay for the website. The most obvious answer is the Bitcoin Foundation, but there is a clear line between the foundation website and the Bitcoin.org website. The next step would be to contact the Foundation board and see if they are willing to fund it. Another issue that needs to be addressed is anti-DoS measures, although it is unlikely that anyone would try to attack an informational website like Bitcoin.org. The server for the website also needs to be determined, ideally with a hosting provider that accepts Bitcoin. Additionally, the administrator and DNS controller for the website need to be identified. Currently, Sirius owns the DNS for Bitcoin.org, but he needs to pass it on to someone who is still involved with the project. The most neutral candidate would be the Foundation.Overall, while there is potential for adding interactive/server-side code in the future with a new website host, there is a fair amount of work that needs to be done to get to that point. A member of the Bitcoin community argued against SSL, saying that BGP redirection can be exploited without much difficulty. However, SSL does provide protection against active interception of traffic to the server, and the pgp signature provides additional protection, though people do not always check for it.</p>
