    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 27, 2013, Mike Hearn announced a new block explorer for testnet, which is built using bitcoinj. The author can be contacted on IRC sometimes using the nick damethos. There's also a REST/JSON API for it. However, the coinbase tx doesn't necessarily come first in the listing (it's sorted by "time received"). The original blockexplorer.com, which was the only block explorer for testnet for a long time, is unfortunately often broken / behind / slow and not really maintained any more. Mike Belshe suggested two other testnet explorers: <a href="http://testnet.btclook.com/">http://testnet.btclook.com/</a> and <a href="http://test.webbtc.com/">http://test.webbtc.com/</a>. The latter does not currently fully function with creating transactions because there's no "unspent" API for getting the unspent values for an address. If there existed a testnet explorer which would send out those values (as blockchain.info does with the main net), that would be awesome. Mike Belshe also mentioned that he is working on a testnet explorer with semantic web markup so that it's both human and machine readable.</p>
