    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of adding reliance on data from third parties outside the Bitcoin network is not well-received and may be rejected because it poses potential vulnerabilities. The proposal suggests that exchanges should be hard-coded into Bitcoin or miners should choose, but there must be a consensus between miners to avoid rejections from peers. Many people bought Bitcoin hoping for its value to increase compared to other currencies, not just because of its fixed money supply. However, the proposal mentioned by Ryan Carboni was met with widespread laughter and even mockery due to its impracticality.</p>
