    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are commands available to access a peer's mempool state, which can be used by nodes to request the contents of a peer's memory pool. The "mempool" command is currently used by SPV clients to find transactions that were broadcast before they were started up but not yet confirmed. Recovering faster after a reboot is possible by reading a peer's mempool or persisting the mempool in a database locally. 0.9 has code to save the mempool to disk. The contents of the mempool may vary depending on when the node was started and what it saw at what times, which could be distinguishing in a way, but not in any important way. Normally, if a transaction is in the mempool, it will be relayed unless there are quirks to do with sendrawtransaction RPCs or strangely crafted wallet spends. While there is no recommended place to compare features implemented by different wallet software, people have compiled tables somewhere.</p>
