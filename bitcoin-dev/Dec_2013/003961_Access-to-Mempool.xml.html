    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are commands available to access a peer's mempool state, which can allow miners to recover faster after a reboot. However, persisting mempool in a database locally can also have the same effect. It is unclear what information can be gained about a node from its mempool and whether there are any distinguishing features that can be observed. It is also unknown whether there are transactions that can be received into one's own mempool but not forwarded, or if 'nLockTime' transactions play a role. The status of this new feature is unclear, as well as which clients support it. Additionally, the author asks if there are recommended sources to compare the features implemented by different wallet software. Despite the many questions posed, there is no summary provided.</p>
