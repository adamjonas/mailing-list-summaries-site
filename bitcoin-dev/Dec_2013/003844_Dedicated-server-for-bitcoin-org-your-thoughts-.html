    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of creating a dedicated server for bitcoin.org. The main issues that need to be resolved include determining who will fund the server, ensuring it is protected against DoS attacks, finding a trustworthy admin with SSH access for core developers, and controlling DNS for the website. Some suggest that the Bitcoin Foundation should fund the server, while others believe it should be funded privately. It is also suggested that the website be protected by CloudFlare. Additionally, the domain registration should be reviewed to ensure it is in good hands and if possible, moved to core developers for better control. Overall, the discussion centers around ensuring the security and reliability of the bitcoin.org website.</p>
