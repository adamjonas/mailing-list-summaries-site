    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In December 2013, Mike Hearn proposed a timeline for version 0.9 of Bitcoin which was expected to be released by the end of January. He added that PPv1 did not have any notion of fee and suggested that it could be added easily but they needed to launch the existing feature set. Bitcoinj had code pending review to implement PPv1 in bitcoinj; however, it was not passing unit tests, and the author could not figure out why. Mike Hearn hoped to get the code working and merged by the end of the year.Jeff Garzik replied to Mike Hearnâ€™s message, stating that BitPay had noticed last week that some transactions were not even reaching their bitcoind border routers due to low/no fees. This led to a long discussion of all things fee-related. SPV fees were a big issue as well as getting child-pays-for-parent in some form out to miners. Jeff Garzik suggested that it was important to get a smart, dynamic fee market.</p>
