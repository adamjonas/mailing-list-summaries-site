    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn proposed new messages for incoming and outgoing transactions. The message for incoming transactions would say "This payment did not become spendable since xxx minutes. Check with the sender if s/he paid the Bitcoin network fee. Check if your internet connection is working properly." Meanwhile, the message for outgoing transactions would say "This payment still has not been transmitted. Check if your internet connection is working properly." The conversation then shifted to discussing fees. It was stated that senders attaching fees was the wrong way around because it's the recipient who cares about double spending risk, not the sender. The UI for sending money should be dead simple, with no mention of fees anywhere. However, the protocol pieces to achieve this are lacking, so someone needs to sit down and figure out what the UI should look like in the ideal world.Regarding outgoing transactions, Hearn suggested a "Revoke" button for cases where it is clear that the transaction won't be confirmed. However, this idea was met with disagreement as there should never be any cases in which a transaction doesnâ€™t confirm. Settlement failure is just unacceptable and building a UI around the possibility could encourage people to think of it as normal, when it should not be so.</p>
