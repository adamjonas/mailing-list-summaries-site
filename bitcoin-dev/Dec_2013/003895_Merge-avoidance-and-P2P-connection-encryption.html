    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the discussion is about a possible use case for pastebin style hosting sites for payment requests. The idea is that regular end-users could upload a signed or unsigned payment request to a site like payr.com and the site would take care of incrementing the iteration count on each download of the file. This would be useful if someone wanted to use the payment protocol without having to handle the iteration count themselves. The discussion also mentions that if the use case involves giving an organization a "here's where to pay my salary" PaymentRequest with several outputs each having a different xpubkey, then the organization's wallet software should take care of iterating. Both use cases can be supported, and iteration ranges could be specified if someone wants to specify expiry in terms of number of payments rather than time.</p>
