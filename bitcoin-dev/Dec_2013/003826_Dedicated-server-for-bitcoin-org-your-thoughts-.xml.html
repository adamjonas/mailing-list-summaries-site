    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 email exchange, Mike Hearn voiced his opinion on the ownership of DNS for bitcoin.org. He believed that Sirius still owned it, despite no longer being actively involved with the project. Hearn suggested that Sirius should pass on control to someone who is currently involved with Bitcoin. However, Hearn was opposed to the Bitcoin Foundation taking control of bitcoin.org. He believed that it would be unwise for the foundation to accept such responsibility were it offered. It is unclear why Hearn held this view. This email exchange highlights the importance of maintaining clear ownership and control over key aspects of the Bitcoin project. It also shows that there may be differing opinions on who should have control, even among those who are actively involved in the project.</p>
