    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It appears that a site was moved onto a dedicated server temporarily and it melted down under the load, indicating some progress. The load that caused the melt down is not specified. One person argues that Drak's threat model is not improved by SSL but rather by increasing the use of signature checking. However, someone else points out that TLS does raise the bar and is worth doing. They reference Applebaum's talk, where he pushes TLS hard and states that based on their access to source docs, some MITM attacks can't beat TLS. They also mention that hosting downloads on AppEngine or something similar may be a solution if a server that can handle high load and TLS cannot be found.</p>
