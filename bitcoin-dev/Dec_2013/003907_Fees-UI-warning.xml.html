    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, a suggestion was made to prevent sad stories like someone paying excessive fees for their Bitcoin transactions, by implementing a confirmation box in wallets if the fee amount seems unreasonable. The suggestion included setting parameters such as >10x what the default fee should be or greater than x% of the sending amount. However, the person making the suggestion noted that brainwallet.org, which is not a "good" wallet app, was being used by the individual who paid excessive fees. They expressed displeasure at the existence of this site and even asked the owner to stop running it, but their request was refused. The site was described as an extremely sharp tool that makes it easy to cut oneself, but it does not look dangerous and appears to be ordinary software designed for ordinary people. Ultimately, there may not be a straightforward solution to the issue of badly designed software that looks appealing and poses a danger.</p>
