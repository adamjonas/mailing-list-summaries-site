    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and others in 2013, there was a discussion about Bitcoin transaction fees. Andresen stated that fee-per-kilobyte is not a good idea because users don't care how many kilobytes their transactions are. This confusion might arise if they have to pay a different amount than what they expected. One person suggested that the user always sees the same amount but the receiver may receive less if the user decides to pay with a huge transaction. It was also discussed that for person-to-business transactions, it may be acceptable for receivers to not always receive exactly what they requested. However, for person-to-person transactions, any fee at all can be confusing. The group pondered if this could lead to a world where buying things from shops involves paying fees while person-to-person transactions tend to be free. Another possibility mentioned was that wallets could let users override safeguards on spending unconfirmed coins when they trust the sender.</p>
