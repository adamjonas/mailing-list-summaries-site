    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Payment Protocol version 1 (PPv1) currently does not have a concept of fees. Although it could be easily added, the current focus is on launching the existing feature set. There is code pending review to implement PPv1 in bitcoinj, but it is not passing unit tests and the author is unable to determine why. The aim is to get it working and merged by the end of the year. It may be time to discuss timelines for version 0.9, and there is a suggestion that floating fees should be separated from the release and launched in a quick follow-up version 0.10 instead. This would allow version 0.9 to go into beta relatively soon, possibly early next year. Despite the need for improvements, it would be a shame to further delay the release.Last week, BitPay noticed that some transactions were not reaching their bitcoind border routers due to low or no fees. This led to a discussion on fee-related issues, including the need for a smart, dynamic fee market and the implementation of child-pays-for-parent in some form to ensure miners receive appropriate fees. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, suggests that these are important considerations for improving the network.</p>
