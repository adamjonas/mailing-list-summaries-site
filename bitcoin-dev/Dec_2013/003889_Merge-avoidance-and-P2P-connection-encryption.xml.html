    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Mike Hearn and an anonymous person suggests the implementation of "super addresses" in Bitcoin wallets. The proposal is related to BIP32, which encourages people to use a single address instead of traditional ones. This would improve privacy as users never need to merge coin if they had one of these super addresses. Additionally, this concept would fit nicely into BIP70, where the PaymentDetails message allows the merchant to provide multiple outputs. If the PaymentDetails provide one traditional output and one super address, the payment could be broken into as many pieces as needed to match unspent outputs already in the customers' wallets. Finally, the refund_to address in Payment could also be upgraded to a super address to enhance privacy there. The author believes that many such privacy-enhancing possibilities will be simple to implement once BIP32 is widely deployed. There is no clarity on whether large memory requirements are needed for super addresses. However, the author believes that such proposals could help improve Bitcoin's privacy features.</p>
