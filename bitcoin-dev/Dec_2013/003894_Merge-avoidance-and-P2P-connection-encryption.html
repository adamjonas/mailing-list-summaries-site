    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between the developers talks about implementing merge avoidance and coinjoin together. They discuss a way to get coinjoin working well by taking advantage of non-time-critical payments to act as counterparties to time-critical payments. BitPay could schedule a vendor payment to happen in full by some time in the future, say 1 day, and send the funds in one or more joins. The amounts sent in each transaction are then picked to match the amounts desired by the counterparty who needs funds sent right now. Getting vendors on board would be gravy. The idea of the NSA and Chinese equivalent wasting money completing each other's joins is hilarious.Jeff Garzik suggests that the Foundation's wallet software should take care of iterating for key address-non-reuse cases such as Miner payouts, BitPay salary payouts, etc. all use a statically provided manually changed address. Rotating through multiple outputs is a stopgap but HD wallets will solve this in a better way, but existing randkey systems will be around for a long time.</p>
