    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin.org domain is under the control of two individuals, one of whom identifies themselves as Sirius and the other remaining anonymous. The issue of anonymity has been brought up by an individual who expresses a preference for real names rather than pseudonyms. This individual believes that all core developers, with the exception of Satoshi, use their real names and hopes that no one has pseudonymous commit access nowadays.Regarding the registrant of the domain, the same individual believes that it should be a real entity and not an anonymous one like WhoisGuard. They propose that the Bitcoin Foundation would be a suitable candidate to own the domain in a similar fashion as the Linux Foundation owns kernel.org. However, this proposal may be irrelevant unless the current legal owners of the domain are willing to assign it.</p>
