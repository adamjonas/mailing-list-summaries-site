    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd are discussing the topic of replacing fees in Bitcoin transactions. Todd argues that replacing fees is as speculative as Hearn's original proposal and that Hearn is trying to convince people to change the way things work with fees. Hearn counters by saying that his original proposal hasn't received any comments and thus must be uncontroversial. He also mentions that the discussions around fee handling are specific to the payment protocol, which is not currently used anywhere. Hearn accuses Todd of talking about fundamental changes to how all Bitcoin nodes operate, which is off-topic for this thread. Todd suggests that wallets should compete, and the best user experience should win. The email ends with Todd's contact information and a digital signature.</p>
