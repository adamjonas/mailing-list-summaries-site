    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 email exchange, Bitcoin enthusiast Mike/Casascius suggested that if the consensus shifted towards accepting inflation for Bitcoin, merchants would vote for changing the rules rather than adopting another altcoin. He believed that such an altcoin would emerge around the time of this consensus and reflect its views on inflation. However, Andrew Poelstra responded that any change to the inflation formula would violate the trust of those holding the currency who obtained it while believing that its inflation algorithm would not change. Ryan Carboni disagreed, stating that many people bought Bitcoin hoping that its value in relation to other currencies would increase and that his proposal would still allow for significant appreciation in value. Earlier, in 2011, Mike/Casascius had pushed an agenda on Bitcointalk advocating for a fixed money supply, but was met with strong and unanimous opposition.</p>
