    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion thread on a forum regarding the feasibility of "stablecoins" in a secure and P2P system was deemed off-topic by one participant, who believed that it was impossible to implement. The participant suggested that if the original poster wanted to learn more about why their proposal was unfeasible, they should have asked questions instead of dismissing critiques as closed-mindedness. The participant referenced previous proposals about stablecoins and their personal participation in trying to find a solution. A link to the freicoin subforum, where initial proposals about stablecoins were made, was also provided.</p>
