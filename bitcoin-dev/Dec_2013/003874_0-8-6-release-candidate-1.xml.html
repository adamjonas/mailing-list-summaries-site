    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Drak and Roy Badami took place on December 9, 2013. Drak pointed out that the bitcoin.org website was still pointing downloads to version 0.8.5 of bitcoin. Roy Badami replied by saying that it makes sense not to promote release candidates on the website. However, Drak stated that version 0.8.6 had been released and was all over bitcointalk/reddit. Roy Badami then asked if there was a mailing list that he missed as it would be nice to have announcements posted on both the mailing list and bitcointalk.org.</p>
