    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is regarding a proposal to adjust Bitcoin's difficulty downwards if only four blocks have been mined over a three-day period. Mark Friedenbach argues that this adjustment could introduce security risks, and suggests alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms that have been explored by some alts, such as the 9-block interval, 144-block window, Parks-McClellan FIR filter used by Freicoin to recover from just such a mining bubble. In response to this, Robin R Chauhan asks for resources to help understand blockchain security and proof-or-work schemes and to reason clearly about such proposals before bringing them to the list or a senior dev. He notes that there is often a wide gulf between those few people who can reason about it and those who have trouble with it, and ideally wants resources to illustrate past proposals, explain why they would and wouldn't work, and build up some fundamental concepts, like a "Newtons laws of blockchain security" that would help us evaluate such ideas on our own.</p>
