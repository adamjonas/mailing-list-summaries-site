    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Drak on December 8, 2013, the topic of BGP redirection and its exploitation was discussed. Drak asserts that BGP redirection is a reality and can be easily exploited. However, Maxwell argues that Drak's comments are actually arguing against SSL, which provides protection against an active attacker who intercepts traffic to the server. Maxwell states that SSL makes BGP redirection useless because the browser holds the signatures of trusted certificate authorities (CA's), making it impossible for an attacker to spoof a certificate. The purpose of SSL is to encrypt and prove identity, and it thwarts man-in-the-middle attacks by providing loud warning interstitials in the browser if an MITM is present.</p>
