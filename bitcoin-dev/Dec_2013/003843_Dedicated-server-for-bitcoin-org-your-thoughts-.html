    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2013, a user named Drak raised concerns about the control over the bitcoin.org domain. The main concern was the robustness factor, meaning that if the current controller becomes unavailable for any reason, others need to have the ability to take control. Drak suggested that the same people who controlled the software project at sf,github should also have control over the domain. Currently, the bitcoin.org domain is controlled by three individuals: the sender of the email (Drak), Sirius and an anonymous person. However, Drak believes that it would be a good idea to separate bitcoin.org from Github as he doesn't trust it. He also suggests that having SSL would be a good idea. Lastly, Drak recommends finding a sponsor for a dedicated server and asks if any DNS changes are required.</p>
