    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the possibility of disconnecting multiple Bitcoin miners from the rest of the network. It is suggested that it would take an attack at the highest levels of the internet infrastructure and that a state-level actor would be required to accomplish such a task. However, Mark Friedenbach argues that it does not take a state-level actor to do network attacks. Ryan Carboni proposes that if time is greater than three days and after four blocks have been mined, then difficulty would be reset. This would require isolating roughly one percent of the Bitcoin network's hashing power which would indicate an attack by a state actor. The conversation ends with Friedenbach seeking clarification on what "difficulty would be reset" means and stating his objections.</p>
