        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There is an open source implementation of the Bitcoin protocol called Bits of Proof, launched by TamÃ¡s Blummer at the Bitcoin2013 conference. It provides a remote wallet feature and can be found on GitHub. The creator's website offers supporting documentation.In May 2013, there was a discussion about the number of client nodes on the Bitcoin network. Luke Dashjr confirmed that there were approximately 57,000 listening nodes running protocol >= 70001 with a timestamp no older than 24 hours. However, this count didn't include connect-only nodes or non-p2p nodes like Electrum.The proposal to separate the wallet from the node in Bitcoin mining was brought up. This aimed to improve security and flexibility. Electrum had already achieved this separation, but the proposal had some key differences, such as aiming for a decentralized system.Bitcoin Grant organization offered a financial incentive of 500 bitcoins or $500,000 to develop a smarter and more efficient system. The main goal was to separate the wallet from the node to strengthen the system and prevent cancer attacks. The organization welcomed grant proposals and suggestions.Another suggestion was to create a special compiled bitcoind simulator to speed up processing transactions and blocks between virtual nodes. This would require significant additional work but could provide greater confidence in code changes.Bitcoin Grant initiative continued to offer a financial incentive of 500 bitcoins or $500,000 for modularization of the Bitcoin system. The aim was to separate the wallet from the node and increase the node count to prevent cancer attacks. They emphasized the need for tightly written technical requirements and collaboration with developers.There was a discussion about estimating the number of nodes on the Bitcoin network. Estimates varied, with one mentioning around 57,000 nodes, while an email from 2013 suggested it was around 8,000.Bitcoin Grant believed that compensating developers for their work on open source projects was important. They sought to develop a smarter and more efficient system by separating the wallet from the node and increasing the node count. They welcomed feedback, suggestions, and grant proposals.Bitcoin Grant offered 500 bitcoins or $500,000 to developers for modularizing Bitcoin's infrastructure beyond the bloom filter. The goal was to separate the wallet from the node and increase the node count to prevent cancer attacks. They believed in compensating excellent developers and aimed to develop a smarter and more efficient system. Feedback, suggestions, and grant proposals were encouraged.</p>
