    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of using self-certifying keys for transport security. The key would be similar to a bitcoin address and act as the node identity, authenticated through ephemeral ECDH transport. There is potential for nodes to have reputations, allowing them to charge higher micropayments for their p2p network services. A gossip protocol could allow users to find out what others think about the reliability and trustworthiness of nodes. It was suggested that each node could use a Brands private credential with offline double-spend detection, with the reputation but not coin address of the node disclosed and the node's coin address embedded in the proof. If a node were to double spend a coin, it would lose its reputation. Another idea proposed was requiring proof of the existence of the private key of a high-value coin in the double-spend revealed information, with a forfeited good behavior bond being awarded to the first person to discover cheating. The use of per-node identity keypairs is seen as a step towards non-repudiation, which is always useful when there is trust.</p>
