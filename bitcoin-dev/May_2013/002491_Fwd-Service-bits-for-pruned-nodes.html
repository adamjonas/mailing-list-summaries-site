    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on May 1st, 2013 at 15:26:57, Jeff Garzik proposed the idea of a generalized HTTP REST query protocol. Although he acknowledged that such a protocol would be beneficial to add, he also noted that it was off-topic for the current thread. However, during an IRC conversation held the day before, an HTTP query interface was discussed and deemed a useful addition to bitcoind. Garzik suggested that this topic should be discussed in a separate email thread. As an example, he provided a link to a pull request he wrote for an HTTP REST interface that downloads an encrypted wallet backup. Dr. Andy Parkins responded to Garzik's email, stating that he is usually behind the state-of-the-art when suggesting ideas and that he should trust that the development team has already planned everything he might think of. His email signature included his contact information, including his email address.</p>
