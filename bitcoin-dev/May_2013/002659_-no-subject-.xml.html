    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Zooko Wilcox-OHearn and jgarzik, the topic of rule changes was discussed. Jgarzik expressed a disinterest in rule changes, to which Zooko inferred that he meant rule changes with economic impact, such as miner block rewards, total number of bitcoins, and block speed. These changes are mostly non-technical but are the only changes most altcoins seem to be making. It is important to note that these rules are set in stone and cannot ever be changed for Bitcoin or all hell will break loose. The email also included a link to the Hardfork Wishlist on the Bitcoin Wiki. Wladimir was also CC'd on the email.</p>
