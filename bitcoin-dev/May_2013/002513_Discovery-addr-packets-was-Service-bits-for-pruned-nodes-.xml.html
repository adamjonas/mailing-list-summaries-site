    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Peter Todd suggests adding a new protocol message that asks the node to sign the current accumulated hash. When asked why not just use standard SSL, he explains that SSL doesn't provide non-repudiation, which is what they want. He wants to be able to prove to others that some node deceived him. Additionally, he argues that there should be some way of cheaply getting non-reputable signatures regardless of transport.Regarding using Tor in library form and connecting to hidden services being slow, Peter Todd suggests working with The Guardian Project for phone stuff. They've implemented Tor on Android among other things and want to find easier ways for apps to use it. He also recommends looking into torchat, which bundles a special tor build and runs a hidden service.Peter Todd has switched to running on tor exclusively for his personal node and finds it to connect and sync up very fast most of the time. However, the biggest slowdown appears to be the timeout on the tor connections, which is very high. If it gets unlucky on the first couple of attempts, it can be minutes before it establishes a connection. He notes that they are short on onion peers and sometimes gets inbound connections before managing to get an outbound.Finally, Peter Todd mentions that because of services like Blockchain.info attacking casual privacy users not using their webwallet service, even clients that don't normally use Tor should make their own transaction announcements by bringing up a connection over tor and announcing.</p>
