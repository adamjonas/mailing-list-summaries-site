    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list revolved around various topics related to Bitcoin mining, including the possibility of manipulating the network by hacking a pool or segmenting the network. The participants agreed that such attacks could be short-lived and inconsiderate. They also discussed the difficulty level in Bitcoin mining and how it can be reduced by a factor of 4 every 2016 blocks. The conversation then shifted towards the security of Bitcoin software packages, with one participant acknowledging that many Linux users rely on these packages for the mainline Bitcoin client. While some maintainers are doing a good job, there are concerns about SSL and CA infrastructure vulnerabilities that make SSL mostly a false sense of security. The gpg signatures and gitian downloader signatures provide good security, but getting people to use them remains an open question.</p>
