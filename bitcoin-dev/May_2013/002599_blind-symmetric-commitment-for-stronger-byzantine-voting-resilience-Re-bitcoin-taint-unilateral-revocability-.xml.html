    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about Bit-commitments, which are based on deterministic one-way functions. The committed coins are not linkable to non-blind coins because the public key is not revealed in the act of receiving to a coin address. Commitments can only be validated once per public key. Each committed coin would be one-spend-commit as verified by the recipient. The blind commitment protocol offers something like community policing. Users on the chain can still themselves do fraud tracing, or any policy they choose, on any blind committed coins that they receive. If they don't like the color of them, they can refund them. The network just places the commitments in order as with conventional transactions. It's usually trivial to add tracing to an otherwise privacy-preserving protocol.</p>
