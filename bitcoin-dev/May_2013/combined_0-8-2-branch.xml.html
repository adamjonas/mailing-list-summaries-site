        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 30, 2013, a user named grarpamp suggested that a new branch should be created at v0.8.2 to include critical fixes without needing to track post-release changes. This suggestion was made for those who wish to track that level of defect without following all the growing post-release developments in HEAD. Critical fixes such as d315eb0 that may be necessary for release builds would be included in this branch. The purpose of this branch would be to provide a stable point of reference for those not interested in the latest developments but still in need of important fixes.In response to this suggestion, Luke announced that he would create the 0.8.x branch in the coming weeks. For now, the stable branches are available on Gitorious. This announcement was made to ensure that important fixes were available to those who needed them without having to follow all the post-release updates. Overall, the creation of the 0.8.x branch was intended to make it easier for users to access critical fixes without having to keep up with all the changes in the main branch. The stable branches are currently available on Gitorious and the new branch is expected to be created in the near future.</p>
