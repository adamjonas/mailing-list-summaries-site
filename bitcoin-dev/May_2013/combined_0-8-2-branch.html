        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 30, 2013, a user named grarpamp proposed the creation of a new branch at v0.8.2 in order to incorporate critical fixes without the need to keep up with post-release changes. In response, Luke announced that he would be creating the 0.8.x branch in the upcoming weeks. Currently, the stable branches can be found on Gitorious.The suggestion to create a 0.8.2 branch at commit 09e437b has been made for those who want to track a specific level of defect without having to follow all the ongoing developments in HEAD. This branch would include important fixes, such as d315eb0, which may be necessary for release builds. The purpose of this branch would be to provide a stable reference point for individuals who are not interested in the latest developments but still require significant fixes.By creating this branch, users will have the option to focus on critical fixes and maintain stability without being burdened by the continuous post-release developments. This allows for easier tracking of specific defect levels and ensures that important fixes are accessible for release builds. The 0.8.x branch, which will be created by Luke in the near future, will serve as a reliable source for those who prioritize stability over the latest developments.</p>
