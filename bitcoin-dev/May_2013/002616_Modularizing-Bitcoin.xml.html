    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A financial incentive of 500 bitcoins or $500,000 was offered by Bitcoin Grant to jump start the development of modularization of the system. The primary upcoming priority beyond the bloom filter for Bitcoin's infrastructure is continued modularization. The grant aims to separate the wallet from the node as it has already been done with mining. Modularization would make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which is currently low. Brenton suggested that the modularization effort should first focus on defining the protocols and APIs of the various modules rather than just refactoring existing code. This approach would promote diversity of implementations and allow for equivalent but alternate implementations. It would also reduce the impact any one implementation defect can have on the overall Bitcoin infrastructure and allow optimization work of modules to proceed more easily as coupling with external modules is reduced. Additionally, this approach allows analysis and critiquing of Bitcoin's infrastructure to be undertaken at a higher level than source code. Brenton suggested collaboration with others in such an undertaking.</p>
