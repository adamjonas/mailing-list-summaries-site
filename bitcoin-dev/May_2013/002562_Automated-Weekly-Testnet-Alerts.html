    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Starting from next Thursday, developers will have access to automated weekly alerts to test their alert-handling code. These alerts will be broadcasted on the testnet and will contain a message stating that it is a test alert with the timestamp of the initial broadcast. The alerts will expire between 2 to 4 hours and will have varying priority. These weekly alerts will be announced at 13:00 UTC, which is currently 9am EST. This initiative has been taken to provide developers with a reasonable way to test their alert-handling code. This move will help them identify any issues or bugs in their alert-handling system and improve it accordingly. With these weekly alerts, developers can ensure that their systems are working efficiently and effectively. It is important to note that these alerts are only for testing purposes and not actual emergencies. The purpose of the alerts is to provide developers with a platform to test their systems and make necessary improvements. Overall, this new feature will be beneficial for developers who want to test their alert-handling code and ensure that their systems are working effectively. It is a step towards improving the overall security and reliability of the system.</p>
