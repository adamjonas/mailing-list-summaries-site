        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 14, 2013, several discussions surrounding PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key security were held. Harald Schilly suggested storing encryption keys as a TXT entry on one's own domain using the command "dig +short harald._pka.schil.ly. TXT" or automatically through "$ gpg ... --auto-key-locate pka -r email at address.domain". However, there were concerns about the security of DNS. Meanwhile, Melvin Carvalho discussed his own security measures, which included using a hardware smartcard to store his PGP key and separating his master signing key from his day-to-day signing subkeys. He also regularly PGP signed emails for verification purposes. In response to his post, Peter Todd questioned the guarantees provided by PGP keyservers and whether they could suffer from a similar 51% attack as the Bitcoin network.Another discussion centered around the use of PGP fingerprints in talks and presentations as a security measure. Although fraud is possible, it was deemed reasonable due to the wide audience and opportunities for detection. The importance of the web-of-trust in PGP verification was also highlighted, along with the need for better code signing practices and valid key authentication. Finally, an email conversation from 2013 revealed that PGP keyservers are vulnerable to spamming, but storing PGP keys as a TXT entry on one's own domain can help avoid reliance on keyservers and reduce the risk of spamming attacks.</p>
