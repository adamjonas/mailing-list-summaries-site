    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2013, Adam Back suggested the use of fixed size committed coin spends for better cryptography. The system involved using blind-sender, auth-tag, and encrypted-tx-commit with pub key P = xG, G = base point. Blind-sender was cP (public key EC multiplied by constant c) and sig was ECDSA( cx, encrypted-tx-commit ). Encrypted-tx-commit was AES( K, tx-commit ) where K was random. To reveal to a recipient, one had to send them P and K at each hop. However, earlier in the committed spend chain could force a reveal for someone later if the same K was used every time. To solve this, K_i was used for different spends and was included in the encrypted-tx-commit with K_{i-1} || tx-commit. The symmetric encrypted variant of the coin as specified was already evaluatable with fixed size committed spend. The limitation is one-use coin committed addresses (and inability to remove spend to committed junk with public validation, though there is the tx fee as a discouragement, it does bloat a recipients verification and so maybe frustrates SPV->SPV consumption of committed coins). The blind-sender was SHA1( SHA256( 1, pub ) ), auth was HMAC-SHA256-128(K, encrypted-tx-commit), and K was SHA-256(pub). Adam suggested using a KDF like IEEE P1363 KDF2 or PKCS#5 PBKDF2 with 1 iteration rather than ad hoc hashes for key derivation to improve the clarity in terms of the purpose of hashes.</p>
