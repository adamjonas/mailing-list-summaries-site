    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, the Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation, has shared his opinion on a proposal to use uuid instead of "main" / "test" in the payment protocol. He voted against the proposal and explained that the payment protocol will become at least 3 BIPs which includes Protocol messages, MIME type, and bitcoin: URI extension. He further explains how an alt coin would need its own version of (2) and (3) which means when a foocoin: link is clicked, a foocoin-specific MIME type is fetched and foocoin.exe is launched to handle the request. He also discusses how a specific MIME type is fetched and delivered to the HandlesLotsOfCoins application and if a payment request is delivered via HTTP or email, it will be bundled up in an envelope of some sort with the MIME type attached. After considering all this, he changed his mind regarding which coin would be encoded in the MIME type and which chain for that coin would be encoded in PaymentDetails.network.</p>
