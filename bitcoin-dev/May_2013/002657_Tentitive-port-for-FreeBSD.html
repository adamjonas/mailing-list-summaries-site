    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on May 25, 2013 at 3:36:46 AM, Robert Backhaus shared a link to the FreeBSD build system 'port' with his colleagues for comments. The Makefile applies users request for GUI/QR/UPNP, while using the external port for leveldb and also contains five patches in the files directory. Among these patches are two that add boost-crypto to LIBS because boost is yet to be updated, one that patches the build to use that external leveldb, and two minor fixes that are needed to build.Robert Backhaus further stated that he has branches ready for pullreqs on those minor fixes and would double-check them before creating the pull requests that evening. Luke commented on the email thread encouraging others to help test and use the pull request for system LevelDB support. He urged caution when tying the port to the specific LevelDB version bundled to avoid any risk of unexpected hardforking bugs or fixes in upstream LevelDB. Luke also requested that portable solutions be found for other patches if they weren't already, and open pull requests on Github.</p>
