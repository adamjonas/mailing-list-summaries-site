    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers Peter Todd and Adam Back have released a replace-by-fee implementation on the testnet. The implementation does not include an "undo" RPC command or adjust fees, and it is vulnerable to DoS attack, so users are discouraged from mining on the mainnet with it. Features will be added as they become available, but patches are welcome. The decision was made after consultation with affected sites and requests from vulnerable parties who wanted to remain undisclosed. A replace-by-fee server operating on the testnet is now available at testnet-replace-by-fee.bitcoin.petertodd.org. To test the server, users will need to use the raw transaction API and manually create the replacement transaction. The implementation does not include recursive fee evaluation, which makes it more vulnerable to DoS attacks; that way, adoption can proceed gradually. It is also important to note that the upcoming anti-dust rules are yet another example of why zero-conf is much more dangerous to accept than single-conf, which two of the people contacting the developers brought up. In terms of rewards, Peter Todd will receive the full amount for the work done even though it is not 100% complete due to his concern about staging an implementation properly, working with vulnerable sites, and overall genuine interest in the issues at hand rather than the reward.</p>
