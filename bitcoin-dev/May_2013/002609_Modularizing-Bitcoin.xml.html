    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about modularizing Bitcoin, the topic of node count came up. One person questioned whether there was a rough estimate for the number of nodes on the network. Another individual had been curious about this as well and had used the "getaddr" message to traverse the network from seed nodes. They found that there were upwards of 57,000 nodes running protocol >= 70001 with a timestamp no older than 24 hours. However, an email from May 16, 2013 suggested that estimates at the time put the node count around 8,000. The conversation also mentioned that modularization could strengthen the system and increase the node count, potentially making cancer attacks less likely.</p>
