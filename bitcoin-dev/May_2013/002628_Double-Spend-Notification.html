    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of making 0-conf double spends trivial has been proposed but no decision has been made. Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, is skeptical that the proposal will go anywhere, citing faulty thinking about economics as the basis for arguments in favor of it. He believes that double spend notifications, which can help undo mistaken transactions, are a better solution and that Matt has expressed interest in implementing them. This discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in May 2013. The email thread also includes an advertisement for New Relic, a SaaS-based application performance monitoring service.</p>
