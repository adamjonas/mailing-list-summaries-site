    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email begins with a test of the emergency broadcast system, explaining that if it were an actual emergency, official information or instructions would follow. The main content of the email is about an announcement for developers to test their alert-handling code, starting next Thursday on the testnet. The alerts will be automated and sent weekly, containing the message "[TEST] This is a test alert broadcast at $TIMESTAMP" and will expire between 2-4 hours with varying priorities. They will be announced at 13:00 UTC, which is currently 9am EST. The email ends with a link to download a free book called "Graph Databases," which is written by three acclaimed leaders in the field. It appears that the email is being sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
