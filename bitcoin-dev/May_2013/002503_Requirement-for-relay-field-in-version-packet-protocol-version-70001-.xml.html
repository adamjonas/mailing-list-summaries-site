    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 6, 2013, Addy Yeow posted a question on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the relay field in version packets coming from clients with protocol version >= 70001. The question was referring to the Protocol Specification page on the Bitcoin Wiki. It is unclear what the context or purpose of this question was.There was also an advertisement for AppDynamics Lite included in the email, which is a free troubleshooting tool for Java and .NET applications that provides code-level diagnostics for performance bottlenecks. A link was provided to download the tool for free.The email ended with standard information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list, including the email address and a link to subscribe/unsubscribe from the list. An HTML attachment was also included in the email, but it was scrubbed and no further information was given about its content.</p>
