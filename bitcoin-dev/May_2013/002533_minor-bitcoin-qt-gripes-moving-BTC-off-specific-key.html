    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer has identified three minor security issues with their Bitcoin wallet. Firstly, they have requested a way to unlock the wallet without displaying the password in the console screen. Secondly, they have asked for a button to import a private key and transfer it to another key if there are multiple controllers of the private key. Finally, they suggested a UX way to transfer BTC off a specific address. The writer had two scenarios where they needed these features. In the first scenario, someone sent them a small BTC donation by emailing a private key, but they didn't have a Bitcoin address. They needed to move the funds off the private key before the sender could spend it. They used the debug->console unlock wallet option, which displayed the password in cleartext on the screen. They suggest that an "import key" button would be more intuitive.In the second scenario, they had a small amount on a self-controlled private key in the wallet via a Reddit tip. They wanted to take .01 BTC off the private key, but the FAQs suggested that the only way to do it was to spend the entire balance from all keys onto a new address. This method created more network traffic, bigger packets, higher fees, and damaged privacy as all funds ended up linked. The writer suggests that it would be handy to be able to select the key to empty without having to empty the entire wallet into a new key, resulting in smaller transaction KB on the network, lower fees for the user, and less confusion. They were unable to find a way to do this via the console and suggest that it could be another button or right-click option.</p>
