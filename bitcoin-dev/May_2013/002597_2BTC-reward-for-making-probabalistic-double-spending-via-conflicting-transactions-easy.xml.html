    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a method to create two versions of a Bitcoin transaction, one sending coins to a desired recipient and the other sending all the coins back to the sender. The sender intends to pay 2BTC for a command line tool that can create these two transactions and broadcast them simultaneously to different nodes on the network. A possible approach is suggested by using blockchain.info's raw transaction POST API and the local Bitcoin node. In response to this, Alan suggests a way to accomplish the same task with Armory, which involves switching to "Expert" usermode to use the coin-control feature and unsigned transactions. The steps involve creating a transaction using one input, saving it as an unsigned transaction, repeating the process by sending coins to oneself with a larger fee, and then signing and broadcasting both transactions offline. This method only works if the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client has the replace-by-fee patch, since Armory uses it as a gateway to the network. The email also includes a signature and a promotional message about AlienVault Unified Security Management platform.</p>
