    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 1999, a discussion on ecash and blinding took place on the Cypherpunks forum. The context of the discussion was digigold, which offered "ecash" backed in physical gold and ran on Systemics payment server/sox protocol. Regulatory concerns and patent licensing issues prevented digigold and systemics from using blind signatures. However, it was possible to create multiple accounts on demand and shuffle payments for privacy using Systemic SOX protocol. This protocol also had some aspect of Bitcoin's smart contract concepts - ricardian contracts. The thread continued over several messages, with one anonymous reply being particularly interesting as it could have been Nakamoto. A related thread covered Sander & Ta-Shma that zerocoin was based on. There were many more threads about various ecash technologies.</p>
