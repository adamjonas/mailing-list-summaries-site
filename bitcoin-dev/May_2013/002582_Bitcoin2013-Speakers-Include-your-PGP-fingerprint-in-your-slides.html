    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of a report on bitcointalk.org has suggested that adding PGP fingerprints to presentation slides could help improve security during talks. Although he acknowledges the possibility of fraud, he believes that it is outweighed by the potential benefits of a wide audience and greater opportunities for detection. The writer also reminds readers of the importance of the web-of-trust in PGP verification, noting that no single measure needs to be perfect. Finally, he advocates the use of both SSL and certificate authorities alongside PGP WoT to improve code signing practices. He concludes by outlining his own security measures, which include using a hardware smartcard to store his PGP key and separating his master signing key from his day-to-day signing subkeys.</p>
