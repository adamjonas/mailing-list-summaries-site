    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Chrome browser has whitelisted bitcoin: URIs for web apps and Firefox does not use whitelisting at all, meaning it already works there. The goal is to encourage web wallet developers to support the payment protocol as there is a risk that they will be put off from doing so. The next step is to file bugs against WebKit for Safari/iOS/misc other platforms, and IE, although it is uncertain whether Microsoft uses open bug trackers much. Ian pointed out some errors in the BIP21 spec and it was questioned what the process would be for amending the BIP. Gavin Andresen believes that fixing the bugs in place is fine, rather than creating a new BIP. Gregory Maxwell agreed with this approach, especially if the corrections are not gratuitously incompatible.</p>
