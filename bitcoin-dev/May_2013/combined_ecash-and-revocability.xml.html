        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 1999, the Cypherpunks forum saw a discussion on ecash and blinding in the context of digigold. Digigold offered "ecash" backed in physical gold and ran on Systemics payment server/sox protocol. However, regulatory concerns and patent licensing issues prevented digigold and systemics from using blind signatures. Despite this, it was possible to create multiple accounts on demand and shuffle payments for privacy using Systemic SOX protocol, which also had some aspect of Bitcoin's smart contract concepts, such as ricardian contracts. The thread continued over several messages, and one anonymous reply was particularly interesting as it could have been Nakamoto. Another related thread covered Sander & Ta-Shma that zerocoin was based on. There were also many more threads discussing various ecash technologies. Overall, the discussion sheds light on the early developments of cryptocurrency and the challenges faced by pioneers like digigold and systemics in navigating regulatory hurdles and patent licensing issues.</p>
