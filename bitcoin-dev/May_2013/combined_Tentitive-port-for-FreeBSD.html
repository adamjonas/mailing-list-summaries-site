        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 25, 2013 at 3:36:46 AM, Robert Backhaus sent an email to his colleagues sharing a link to the FreeBSD build system 'port'. This email was intended for comments and feedback. The Makefile in this build system incorporates user requests for GUI/QR/UPNP. Additionally, it utilizes an external port for leveldb. The files directory contains five patches, including two that add boost-crypto to LIBS because boost has not been updated yet. There is also a patch that modifies the build to use the external leveldb. Furthermore, there are two minor fixes required for the build process.Robert Backhaus mentioned in his email that he has branches ready for pullreqs on these minor fixes. He plans to double-check them before creating the pull requests later that evening. Luke, another participant in the email thread, encouraged others to test and use the pull request for system LevelDB support. However, he advised caution when linking the port to the specific bundled version of LevelDB to avoid any unforeseen hardforking bugs or fixes in the upstream LevelDB. Luke also requested portable solutions for other patches if they were not already available, and suggested opening pull requests on Github.Robert Backhaus, the developer of the FreeBSD build system 'port', is aiming to have the system committed once version 0.8.2 is released. The Makefile in this build system addresses user requests for GUI/QR/UPNP, with the main change being the use of an external port for leveldb. The files directory contains five patches, including two that add boost-crypto to LIBS and one that modifies the build to use the external leveldb. In addition, there are two minor fixes included. Branches are available for pullreqs on these minor fixes. The files can be found at <a href="https://redports.org/browser/robbak/net-p2p/bitcoin">https://redports.org/browser/robbak/net-p2p/bitcoin</a>. Any comments or feedback on the build system are welcome.</p>
