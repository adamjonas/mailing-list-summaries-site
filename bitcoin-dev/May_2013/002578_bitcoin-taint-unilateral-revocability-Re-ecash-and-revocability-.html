    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Simon shares with Adam a privacy-enhancing solution based on fair exchange through bitcoin contracts and cut-and-choose. This solution would require a public pool of users who would be willing to exchange in common denominations at the same time, ensuring unlinkability while leaving a trace of exchange activity in the chain. Simon provides a link to the solution that could be added to wallet software to become automatic. Adam responds by discussing his beliefs about ecash and revocability, as well as the issue of taint in bitcoin, which risks making some coins spendable only with certain users or at a discount. He suggests that commitments could be an efficient fix for the taint issue without blinding or ZKP of set membership. Adam explains how committing to a payment and locking a coin without identifying yourself until the commitment is released could work, and he outlines the validators' task to check input-pub hash against committed coins by hash, check the transaction hash, and the usual transaction validations. Lastly, Adam mentions an article on 'Auditable, Anonymous Electronic Cash' by Sander & Ta Shma.</p>
