    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list from 2013, there was a discussion around making 0-conf double spends trivial. It was suggested that if a later transaction appears with a larger fee, it will be considered to be the valid one and the first one dropped as long as the first one has not been confirmed. However, no such decision had been made at the time of the discussion. One member of the discussion expressed skepticism about the proposal and suggested instead focusing on making 0-confs more reliable and implementing a system to notify on attempted double-spends. The topic of Peter Todd's experiment with a 2BTC reward was also brought up, but there was no follow-up information provided.</p>
