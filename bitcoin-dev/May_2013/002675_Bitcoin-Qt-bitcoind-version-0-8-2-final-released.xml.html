    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The latest version of Bitcoin-Qt, version 0.8.2, has been released and is available for download on SourceForge. This release includes several bug fixes and a few new features. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker at Github. Those upgrading from earlier versions of the software will need to shut down their current version before installing the update. If upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, users should be aware that their blockchain files will be re-indexed which could take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the speed of their machine. Changes in the release include a lowered default fee for low-priority transactions from 0.0005 BTC to 0.0001 BTC. In addition, payments (transaction outputs) of 0.543 times the minimum relay fee (0.00005430 BTC) are now considered non-standard because storing them costs the network more than they are worth and spending them will usually cost their owner more in transaction fees than they are worth. Non-standard transactions will not be relayed across the network, included in blocks by most miners, or show up in a user's wallet until they are included in a block.Bitcoin-Qt changes include a new icon and splash screen, improved reporting of synchronization process, removal of hardcoded fee recommendations, improved metadata of executable on MacOSX and Windows, moving export button to individual tabs instead of toolbar, and adding "send coins" command to context menu in address book. There are also new translations including Arabic, Bosnian, Catalan, Welsh, Esperanto, Interlingua, and Latvian, as well as many improvements to current translations.JSON-RPC API changes include fixing a getblocktemplate bug that caused excessive CPU creating blocks, listing account and address information in listunspent, returning time adjustment estimated from peers in getinfo, returning bytessent, bytesrecv, and syncnode in getpeerinfo, returning statistics about the unspent transaction output database in gettxoutsetinfo, and returning information about a specific unspent transaction output in gettxout. Networking changes include significant changes to the networking code reducing latency and memory consumption, avoiding initial block download stalling, removing IRC seeding support, adding performance tweaks, and adding testnet DNS seeds. Wallet compatibility/rescuing cases should be reduced with this release and -salvagewallet now works for encrypted wallets.There is one known bug where entering the 'getblocktemplate' or 'getwork' RPC commands into the Bitcoin-Qt debug console will cause the software to crash. Users can run Bitcoin-Qt with the -server command-line option to workaround this issue. The release was made possible by contributions from several individuals including Andrew Poelstra, Gavin Andresen, Gregory Maxwell, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, and Wladimir J. van der Laan, among others.</p>
