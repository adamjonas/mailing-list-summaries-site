    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns discusses a potential problem when combining bundles with different fees. He suggests putting a SIGHASH_ALL sig in the bundle that overpays to prevent miners from making their own tx of just the overpaying bundle. He proposes replacing SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY with an extra couple of witness bytes. Additionally, he suggests that BUNDLESTART is arguably redundant as it can be inferred if there's an INBUNDLE flag when not already in a bundle. In response, they discuss trying to guess future fees for commitment transactions and using parent-pays-for-child. However, the outputs they can spend are timelocked, so it cannot work with HTLC-Success/HTLC-Timeout transactions as they spend outputs from the commitment transaction and need to be pre-signed by the channel partner to ensure the output address is correct. They suggest adding a zero-value anyone-can-spend output to commitment transactions that can then be used with CPFP to bump the fees or having after-the-fact fee-bumping via special sighash flags at the block level.To implement this, they propose using an output script with a zero-amount output which is literally a push of txids and is itself unspendable. However, this would be non-witness data and pretty large. They suggest using 'OP_NOP4' instead and bundling those tx all together.</p>
