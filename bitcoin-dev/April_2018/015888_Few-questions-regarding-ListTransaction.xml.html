    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, participants sought clarification on what it means for an unconfirmed transaction to be trusted or not. The response was that a transaction is considered trusted if it is final and cannot be replaced through conventional means, not in a block that was reorged out, the 'spend zero conf change' option is set, it's in the mempool, and all inputs are from us. However, one participant pointed out that even though it cannot be replaced through conventional means, it is always possible to replace an unconfirmed transaction by asking a miner to mine a conflicting transaction directly. Additionally, full replace-by-fee (RBF) can be used by a significant minority of miners to replace any transaction. Peter Todd's GitHub includes information about RBF in Bitcoin version 0.16.0, and replacing transactions via RBF is reportedly very easy.</p>
