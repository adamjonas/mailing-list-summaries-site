    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev community has proposed a new way to bundle transactions in order to deal with the issue of guessing future fees for commitment transactions. The proposal involves indicating that a signature only applies to part of a transaction, or a "bundle". Bundles can be combined into larger transactions and non-bundled signature inputs/outputs can be appended. A SIGHASH_BUNDLESTART flag indicates the number of inputs and outputs in a bundle, while a SIGHASH_INBUNDLE flag indicates that a signature applies to the current bundle. Two per-tx counters are kept to track the number of inputs and outputs used in each bundle. The proposed bundling method could replace SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY at the cost of an extra couple of witness bytes. It is also possible to establish BIP-69 style ordering rules within a bundle. While the bundling does not seem to offer any privacy benefits, it allows for dealing with discrepancies in fees. A potential issue arises when trying to pre-sign HTLC-Success/HTLC-Timeout transactions, which require the output address to be correct. If the commitment transaction gets bundled and its txid changes, pre-signing becomes impossible. One suggested solution is adding a zero-value anyone-can-spend output to commitment transactions, although this may lead to UTXO bloat if fee bumping isn't needed. Another idea is after-the-fact fee-bumping via special sighash flags at the block level. However, coding this is not straightforward.</p>
