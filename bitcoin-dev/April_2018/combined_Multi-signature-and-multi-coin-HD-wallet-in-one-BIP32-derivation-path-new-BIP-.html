        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, Paul Brown proposed a new BIP32 derivation path that would allow for a single or multi-signature and multi-coin wallet from a single master seed. The proposal aims to address issues with BIP44 and BIP45 regarding portability, such as what address format is expected when discovering balances and creating transactions, whether the master seed represents a single-sig or multi-sig wallet, how many cosigners are involved, and how to prevent collisions on the same address index. The proposal combines BIP44 and BIP45 and adds in a self-describing structure in the derivation path for multiple multi-sig combinations within the single wallet along with an extended public key export file format for public key distribution between parties.However, there are some issues with BIP44 and BIP45 regarding portability, such as what address format is expected when discovering balances and creating transactions, whether the master seed represents a single-sig or multi-sig wallet, how many cosigners are involved, and how to prevent collisions on the same address index in a wallet that is occasionally connected. While BIP45 solves the issue of collision in multi-sig groups, it drops the multi-coin support that BIP44 has.In response to Paul's proposal, Clark Moody suggested proposing new version bytes to change the "xpub" in the encoding to some other string, or using the xpub serialization format described in SLIP-0032, which includes the derivation path within the xpub itself and uses Bech32 for encoding. Brown responded to Moody's suggestions, stating that he had realized after sending his previous response that the encoding was wrong and further proposed extending the derivation path with an additional level below coin type to represent the address format, with the value determined by the context of the coin type value in the derivation path.Brown suggested that a separate spec similar to SLIP-0044 could be created that defines the list of address formats and the derivation path values. He believes this will provide additional validation when extended public keys are shared among cosigners in a multi-sig group. The proposal suggests using bech32 serialized addresses (P2WPKH or P2WSH). However, Paul wonders whether there is merit in extending the derivation path with an additional level below coin type to represent the address format.Clark Moody suggested using the xpub serialization format described in SLIP-0032 as an alternative solution. It includes the derivation path within the xpub itself and uses Bech32 for encoding. This would solve the bootstrapping problem and avoid the UX nightmare of users being required to know to which BIP number the xpub conforms. If the proposal were to use the current BIP-49/84 method by specifying the address format in the purpose field of the derivation path, it would require modifying the proposed BIP each time a new format comes along, making existing wallets that claim BIP-XXXX compliance incomplete. Moody believes that sticking with the one-BIP-one-format method works better.Brown is going to support SLIP-0032 for the serialization format of extended keys. The proposal also talks about a BIP32 derivation path that supports a single or multi-signature and multi-coin wallet from a single master seed. It combines BIP44 and BIP45 and adds in a self-describing structure in the derivation path for multiple multi-sig combinations within the single wallet along with an extended public key export file format for public key distribution between parties. Brown has temporarily assigned it the number 46.</p>
