    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Maksim Solovjov posed two questions related to transaction confirmations. The first question asked what it means for a transaction with zero confirmations to be trusted or not. The response was that a zero-confirmation transaction is considered trusted if it meets certain criteria including being final, not in a reorged block, and having all inputs from the sender. The second question asked when a transaction can have -1 confirmations (conflicted) and what it means to have a conflicted transaction. A transaction is considered conflicted if there exists another transaction that spends the same inputs. If a transaction receives -N confirmations, it means that it was initially mined in a block but that block was orphaned away because a different transaction was mined in a new block, resulting in the original transaction becoming a double spend. This situation can arise due to transaction malleability or double spending.</p>
