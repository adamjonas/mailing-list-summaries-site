    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 2, 2018, Gleb Naumenko shared his ideas regarding transaction relay protocol on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and sought feedback. The links to the discussion thread and a document detailing his proposal were also provided. Naumenko's proposal aimed to improve the efficiency of the Bitcoin network's mempool synchronization and transaction relay protocols by changing the current mechanism used for broadcasting transactions. The proposal involved using an "ancestor-based relay" method where transactions are only transmitted if their unconfirmed ancestors have been received. This approach was expected to reduce the amount of data transmitted across the network, improve synchronization times, and provide better spam protection. The document also discussed how this approach could be implemented in the existing Bitcoin software.Naumenko's proposal received mixed reactions from the community, with some expressing concerns over its potential impact on privacy and censorship resistance. Others praised the proposal for its potential to improve the network's performance and scalability. The discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has since been closed, but the links to the proposal and discussion thread remain available for those interested in reviewing the details of Naumenko's proposal.</p>
