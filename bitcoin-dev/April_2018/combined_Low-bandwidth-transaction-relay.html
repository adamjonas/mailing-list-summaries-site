        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Naumenko recently proposed a change to the Bitcoin network's mempool synchronization and transaction relay protocols. The proposal aimed to improve the efficiency of the protocols by reducing redundancy and improving synchronization times. However, the community has expressed mixed reactions towards the proposal, with some praising it for its potential to improve performance and scalability, while others expressing concerns over its potential impact on privacy and censorship resistance.One concern raised was the potential issue with latency caused by redundant tx INVs. Naumenko suggested further experiments before setting filters on inbound peers to address this issue. It was noted that an average public-IP node utilizing all INVs would consume 0.05 Mbps or 540 megabytes per day in terms of bandwidth consumption.The discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding Naumenko's proposal has since been closed, but links to the proposal and discussion thread are available for those interested in reviewing the details.In addition to Naumenko's proposal, the author of an article shared their own interest in the implications of the blocksonly proposal at a larger scale, including transaction processing and propagation concerns. They proposed an alternative idea that is less complex but still has some propagation concerns. The author also suggested a variation of their idea that could work without INVs and have the same security assumptions as blocksonly. They showed interest in IBLT and BCH-sets proposals but decided to start with a more conservative protocol. Finally, they referenced a couple of links for additional information on the topic, one being a bitcointalk forum thread and the other a document by Gregory Maxwell on mempool sync relay.</p>
