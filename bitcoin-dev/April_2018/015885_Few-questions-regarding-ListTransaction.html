    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses questions related to the ListTransaction RPC call for bitcoin development. The first question asks about what it means for a transaction with 0 confirmations to be trusted or not, and how this value is set to true or false. The response suggests that nothing in bitcoin is trusted unless there are a certain number of confirmations. The second question asks about when confirmations can be -1 (conflicted) and what this means. The response clarifies that -1 doesn't mean conflicted but rather that the transaction is not only unconfirmed but depends on another unconfirmed transaction. The third question asks about adding a watch-only address to bitcoind and whether a first transaction will appear in walletconflicts if a second transaction occurs due to Transaction Malleability. No response is provided to this question. The email also includes opinions on the security and reliability of zero-conf transactions compared to credit card preauths or checks.</p>
