    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author expresses interest in the implications of the blocksonly proposal at a larger scale, including transaction processing and propagation concerns. They propose an alternative idea that is less complex but still has some propagation concerns. The author also suggests a variation of their idea that could work without INVs and have the same security assumptions as blocksonly. They show interest in IBLT and BCH-sets proposals but decided to start with a more conservative protocol. Finally, they reference a couple of links for additional information on the topic. One link is to a bitcointalk forum thread, while the other is a document by Gregory Maxwell on mempool sync relay.</p>
