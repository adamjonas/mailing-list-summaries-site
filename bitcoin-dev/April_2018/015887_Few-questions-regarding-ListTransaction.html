    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a question was raised about what it means for a transaction with 0 confirmations to be trusted or not. Karl-Johan Alm responded by stating that a transaction is considered trusted if it meets five criteria: it is final, not in a block that was reorged out (negative confirmation count), has the 'spend zero conf change' option set, is in the mempool, and all inputs are from us. However, he clarified that "can't be replaced" only refers to conventional means of replacement, as it is always possible to replace an unconfirmed transaction by asking a miner to mine a conflicting transaction directly. It is important to note that having 0 confirmations does not necessarily mean a transaction is untrustworthy, but rather its trustworthiness depends on the criteria mentioned above.</p>
