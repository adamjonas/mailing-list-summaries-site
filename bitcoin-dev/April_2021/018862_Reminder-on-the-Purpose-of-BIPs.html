    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent exchange between developers Matt Corallo and Luke Dashjr has highlighted the ongoing debate around Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) neutrality. The discussion began when Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core contributor, stated that he would not give any "special treatment" to BIP proposals amid accusations that he had previously done so. Corallo responded by accusing Dashjr of being disingenuous and noted that he had been active on numerous PRs in the past. Dashjr defended himself by saying that he had been following his usual process of going through PRs in order of "Recently updated" on GitHub, starting with the least-recent following the last one he had triaged. He encouraged anyone who doubted him to look through the repo history. The incident highlights the importance of maintaining transparency and fairness in the development of Bitcoin.</p>
