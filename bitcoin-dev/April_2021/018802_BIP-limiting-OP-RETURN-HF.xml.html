    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread consists of feedback from Kostas Karasavvas on a BIP proposal by Christopher Gilliard. Kostas provides feedback on the limitations of OP_RETURN, stating that it is 80 bytes and not 40 bytes as previously stated in the proposal. He also questions the purpose of the BIP proposing a layer two protocol, suggesting that it lacks a clear proposal and incentives for users to justify added complexity. He notes that there are several existing L2 solutions that use merkle trees to aggregate data hashes, but their trust assumptions and overhead may not be suitable for all use cases. Christopher responds by acknowledging Kostas' feedback and stating that he is working on additional BIPs that address these concerns. He is open to merging them with the current proposal, but has broken them down into several BIPs for readability purposes. The original BIP can be found on GitHub.Kostas is a software architect, blockchain engineer, researcher, and educator who provides his Twitter handle for reference.</p>
