        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released a new software version called "Bitcoin Core 0.21.0-based Taproot Client" that includes the Speedy Trial activation mechanism, following plans discussed in a previous meeting for consistent use of block height and a BIP 8 activation after one year with LOT=true. The new build is available at bitcointaproot.cc and on GitHub. However, as this release has contributions from pseudonymous individuals and may not be as thoroughly reviewed as an upcoming Bitcoin Core release, users who support the activation mechanism are encouraged to review and test the new release. If the Speedy Trial activation fails to activate on the current Bitcoin Core release, there is no follow-up activation mechanism. There may be another Core release later this year with a follow-up activation mechanism, but as it stands, none exists. Both Bitcoin Core and the Taproot Client will likely activate (or not activate) through Speedy Trial, but since Bitcoin Core uses a mix of MTP and block height while the Taproot Client uses consistent block height, there is a small possibility that one activates while the other does not. If both activate, they will share the same activation block height of 709632 in November 2021.Jeremy Rubin has informed some maintainers of alternative Bitcoin implementations besides Bitcoin Core of the finalized activation parameters in Core. Laolu Osuntokun, maintainer of btcd, has acknowledged the parameters and stated their aim to get everything tested by November. The next meeting on the ##taproot-activation Freenode channel is scheduled for April 20th, hosted by Jeremy Rubin, where an agenda has yet to be announced. It's important to address any errors or perceived bias in this information so that users can make informed decisions.</p>
