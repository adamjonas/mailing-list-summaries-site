    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeremy Rubin has suggested that an address type should be defined for OP_RETURN. He came across this while writing some code that wanted to handle common classes of user transactions generically. The absence of Address defining OP_RETURN makes it difficult to read a Coin containing OP_RETURN. An Address type would aid in simplifying types for programs. This is a challenge for him as he is building the Sapio compiler and wants all contract compilations to result in an Address, but he needs to support OP_RETURN for various reasons. The counterargument against this is that OP_RETURN, being unspendable and usually proprietary in purpose, should not have an address. Most uses of OP_RETURN are proprietary, so pretending to interpret them would be lying to the user. However, Jeremy argues that Addresses should represent things that people commonly create outputs for, and OP_RETURN is such a thing. Many things are unspendable and we cannot know spendability based on address type. He also suggests some design constraints for the proposed OP_RETURN address type: Should it be human-readable & checksummed or encoded? Should it have a fixed length of max 40-80 bytes or should it support arbitrary length strings? Should it be possible to pay into such an OP_RETURN or should we categorize OP_RETURNS as a non-payable address type?</p>
