    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christopher Gilliard has responded to feedback on his proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) regarding the use of OP_RETURN, which is currently limited to 40 bytes of data. The proposal suggests increasing this limit to allow for more complex data structures and proposes a layer two protocol to aggregate data hashes using merkle trees. However, some have raised objections to the proposal, particularly regarding the need for a hard fork and the lack of detail in the proposal itself. Gilliard has stated that he is working on additional BIPs to address these concerns and hopes to have them ready soon. Konstantinos Karasavvas provided feedback on the proposal, including correcting the byte limit for OP_RETURN to 80 bytes and suggesting the need for incentives to justify added complexity for users. He also noted that there are already a multitude of layer two solutions that aggregate data hashes using merkle trees and suggested that any new proposal should be flexible enough to accommodate different use cases.</p>
