    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, a technical decision made by a coin toss has caused controversy in the Bitcoin community. The decision was made regarding the use of block height vs a mix of block height and MTP in a soft fork activation. The organizer of the coin toss, Jeremy Rubin, had previously expressed a preference for fully height-based design but later NACKed block height in a meeting. On April 6th, he agreed to abide by the flip. However, on April 7th, he admitted that the coin flip was theater. This series of events has left some individuals feeling uncomfortable and concerned about the impact on businesses planning to utilize and build on Taproot. Michael Folkson, an individual who wishes to distance himself from this circus, has provided two StackExchange links on block height vs MTP for those interested in the technical considerations.</p>
