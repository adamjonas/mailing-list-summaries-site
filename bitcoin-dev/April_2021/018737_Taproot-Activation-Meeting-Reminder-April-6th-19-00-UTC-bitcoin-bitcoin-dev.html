    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the activation of Taproot, with debate around height-based activation versus Median Time Past (MTP) activation. Andrew Chow has submitted a patchset for height-based activation of Speedy Trial, and some community members prefer this method due to its predictability and cleanliness. However, Jeremy has pointed out that MTP activation can be used to simulate height-based activation by carefully selecting signaling start and end dates to line up in the middle of expected retargeting periods. Russell O'Connor argues that height-based activation offers a guaranteed number of signaling periods, which can benefit the short activation period of Speedy Trial. Anthony Towns provides data on the number of retarget periods and stats from the last few years of mainnet for different signaling periods, highlighting the importance of less real-time variance for successful signaling. Testnet numbers are also provided. Ultimately, the community must determine if they can reach consensus on either approach.</p>
