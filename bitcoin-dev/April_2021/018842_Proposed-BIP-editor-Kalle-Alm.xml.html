    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the subscribers of a bitcoin development list, Antoine Le Calvez expressed his opposition to admins of the Bitcoin GitHub organization intervening in a proposal to extend the BIP editorship membership. He believes that any defect or uncertainty in the BIP Process should not be solved by GitHub janitorial roles and that their roles do not allow them to intervene in case of loopholes. Instead, he recommends being respectful of procedural forms and waiting for a solution that satisfies everyone. Luke Dashjr had proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to assist in merging pull requests into the BIPs Git repository. There is no explicit process for adding BIP editors, but Dashjr believes it should be fine to use BIP 2's Process BIP progression. A Process BIP could be opened for each new editor, but he thinks it is unnecessary and there is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors. Anyone who disagrees with this proposal was asked to speak up.</p>
