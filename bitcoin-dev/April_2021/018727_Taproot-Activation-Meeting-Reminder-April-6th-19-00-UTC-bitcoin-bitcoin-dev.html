    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development meeting, the topic of selecting between MTP and height was discussed. The previous meeting found no substantial publicly discussed benefit to using MTPs over height, but since then, there is now a tangible benefit to using MTP as per AJ's update. The changes AJ promulgated for MTP neutralize the argument that MTP was easier to review. The main conversation in this agenda item is around the pros/cons of height or MTP and determining if consensus can be reached on either approach. In addition, a timeline discussion was held in hopes of reaching consensus on parameters mindful of Core's process. One participant pre-registered a comment that signet should not be a consideration for MTP vs height since taproot is already activated on signet, and there's no indication that ST will be used in the future. They suggested continuing the search for the ideal activation method. The meeting also mentioned an update to MTP time by AJ, which is intended to be compatible with a mandatory signaling period via a LAST_CHANCE change and makes it easier to deploy ST on signets. If rough consensus is not reached around item 2, the proposed schedule from last time may fall short, and the group will discuss realities around scheduling.</p>
