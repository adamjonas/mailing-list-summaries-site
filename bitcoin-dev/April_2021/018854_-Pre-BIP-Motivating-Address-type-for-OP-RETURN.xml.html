    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Dave discussed with Jeremy that script commitments such as P2SH, P2WSH, and P2TR also represent things unknown to us. He demonstrated creating an 11,000 byte OP_RETURN on regtest to update his previous answer of the max size of a scriptsig/scriptpubkey. Jeremy asked about making inappropriate messages using bech32m addressed outputs, to which Dave replied that people have done it in the past with base58check but an IsStandard OP_RETURN attempts to minimize this abuse by being cheaper in two ways. Furthermore, he discussed the PSBT interface and that having an address type would allow more uniform handling, which is convenient for strongly typed RPC bindings. Dave also mentioned that while he does not care how the data in PSBTs are structured, he wants to ensure that adding code to the wallet does not expose everyday users to OP_RETURN addresses. He expressed a +0.1 interest in the idea of an address format of OP_RETURN as long as it is not underwhelmingly motivated or lead to block chain graffiti.</p>
