    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author presents a table of results obtained from running tests to determine the probability of success for different percentages and numbers of trials in order to assess the feasibility of using MTP (Median Time Past) as a means of signaling a smooth upgrade. The results show that there is not much difference in the probability of success between 5 and 7 trials at 90%, with the entire range being under 2%. The repeated trials part does not seem to have any significant effect on mainnet. The author also provides stats on the number of retarget periods one gets depending on the desired signaling period, and raises questions around the possibility of signaling by the time enough miners have upgraded and nodes have enforced new rules. The author concludes that the results demonstrate that MTP can be used to ensure a smooth upgrade. A link to the code used in the tests is also provided.</p>
