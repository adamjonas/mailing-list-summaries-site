    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin development mailing list, Sjors Provoost, has given their ACK (acknowledgment) for adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor. Despite recent drama, having a single editor is not ideal, especially with 110 open pull requests to the BIPs repo. Luke Dashjr proposed adding Kalle Alm as an editor to merge PRs into the bips git repo. Since there is no explicit process to adding BIP editors, it was suggested that BIP 2's Process BIP progression be used, which allows a proposal to achieve rough consensus on the mailing list before becoming Active. While a Process BIP could be opened for each new editor, it is deemed unnecessary and prior precedent exists for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors. Anyone who disagrees is encouraged to speak up soon.</p>
