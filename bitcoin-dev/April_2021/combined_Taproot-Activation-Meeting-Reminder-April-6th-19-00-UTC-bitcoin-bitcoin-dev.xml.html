        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion among the Bitcoin developers is about the pros and cons of using height or MTP to determine the signaling period. The number of retarget periods in a given signaling period based on blocks since 2015-01-01 is also mentioned. The probability of successful activation and hash power required is discussed in different scenarios. Testnet numbers are also presented, showing that the differences are smaller with higher block rates. The issue of time until the next retargeting period variable distribution is raised, which could result in a range between 0 and 14 days. As per the observed timeframe of a single retarget period over the last few years on the mainnet, if LOCKED_IN is determined by a min lock-in time, then activation should be expected to occur between 11 and 34 days. A persistent two-week error in estimating activation time is considered a risk for MTP, but it is not essential to the design goal. Having a last-minute delay of two weeks seems easy to deal with. If the timeout is at X and MTP min lock-in is at X+Y, then the notice period of at least Y + (1 retarget period) can be guaranteed.</p>
