        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on Bitcoin development, the topic of decentralized storage for Bitcoin projects was brought up. Prayank suggested that instead of using a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), it may be more appropriate to create a Lightning Network (LN) project. Luke added to the conversation by suggesting that LN should actually consist of a collection of BIPs, highlighting the need for further standardization proposals.Prayank emphasized the importance of implementation or proof of concept code in the BIP, and proposed that it could just be an LN project instead. They shared some relevant links related to decentralized storage, including bkiac/tarnhelm and ElementsProject/filebazaar. Prayank explained that their idea of decentralized storage for Bitcoin projects involves using torrents for files and communication with Tor. They also suggested the inclusion of an easy-to-use API for saving, reading, editing, etc., specifically for Bitcoin projects utilizing torrents. Payments through the Lightning Network would only be involved when spamming becomes an issue.Christopher expressed agreement with Prayank's suggestion of defining an API for both proposals and keeping it in a separate document from the BIPs. He also agreed with Prayank's opinion on the use of Tor. Christopher mentioned that he has been using the BIP format for his proposals, including the one being discussed, as well as other BIPs he is currently working on. However, he expressed openness to changing the format if it is decided that there is a better one for these BIPs. Christopher also brought up the incentivized moderation protocol, which is mentioned in the BIP under consideration.The writer of the context is conducting research on decentralized storage for a Bitcoin project and expresses interest in the concept. They suggest that including implementation or proof of concept code in the BIP would have been preferable, but since it involves the Lightning Network, it could potentially be its own LN project. The writer provides two links, bkiac/tarnhelm and ElementsProject/filebazaar, as potentially helpful resources for Christopher. They also explain their belief that decentralized storage utilizing torrents with Tor can be beneficial for Bitcoin projects. The writer proposes the creation of an easy-to-use API for various functions in Bitcoin projects using torrents, with payments through the Lightning Network only being involved when spamming becomes a concern. Additionally, they share a link to a project called JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/issues/415, which explores similar options.</p>
