    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers held their second fortnightly taproot activation meeting to discuss several issues related to the technology. The main points discussed during the meeting are as follows: Firstly, luke-jr is still NACK any MTP related thing. Secondly, there are benefits to both MTP and Heights, and both are technically acceptable for Taproot. Thirdly, contributors agreed to abide by a coinflip if it comes up MTP or height in an effort to reach consensus on moving forward with either approach. If a compromise is reached between approaches compatible with the timeline of getting to a RC1 with deployment, then that can be considered in preference of either of the existing approaches. Several people anonymously expressed that they would roll with the decision made by the coinflip. There were mixed feelings about using a coinflip for a technical decision; however, many agreed that both MTP and Heights were acceptable options and a coinflip was an appropriate way of putting aside minute preferences for the big picture. Jeremy Rubin, who wrote the notes, emphasized the importance of rough consensus and running code.</p>
