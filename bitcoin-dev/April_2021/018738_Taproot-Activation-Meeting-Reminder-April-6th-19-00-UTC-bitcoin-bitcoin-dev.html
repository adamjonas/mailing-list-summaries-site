    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the importance of giving users enough time to upgrade their systems before taproot activates. The 180 days value is not critical, but the deadline is. People may estimate different dates based on assumptions like 10 or 9 minutes, which can cause confusion as they may differ significantly. Therefore, using Towns's updated MTP reduces this problem by providing more accurate predictions. Conservative estimators can say that the system needs an upgrade by a specific date, and similarly, ten or nine-minute estimators can do the same. These predictions are unlikely to change until shortly before the lock-in period. This approach makes it easier to communicate with users about the deadline for upgrading, especially for organizations. Moreover, it makes planning activation parties convenient.</p>
