    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Yesterday, a Taproot activation meeting was held on the ##taproot-activation Freenode channel. The agenda was posted in advance to the mailing list by BitcoinMechanic. The conversation log is available on gnusha.org. During the meeting, participants discussed an alternative release to Bitcoin Core with Speedy Trial (BIP 8, consistent use of block height) followed by BIP 8 (1 year, LOT=true) as the activation mechanism(s). However, some participants expressed concern over having "Bitcoin Core" in the name of the alternative release, suggesting that it would be confusing for users and give them the impression that it had been signed off by Bitcoin Core maintainers. The draft release notes for this alternative release are available on Google Docs, while the GitHub repo can be found on BitcoinActivation's GitHub page. To compare this to the most likely activation mechanism(s) in Bitcoin Core at this point, Core PR #21377 is currently being considered for merge, which proposes that the activation mechanism in Bitcoin Core will be Speedy Trial (BIP to be decided, mix of block height and MTP). A BIP PR for the Core release has also been opened with suggested finalized parameters. However, if these plans continue as is, Bitcoin Core and this alternative release won't be entirely compatible due to startheight and timeout being defined according to MTP and block height respectively. While they should both activate at the same block height (or not activate) in the majority of cases, there are unlikely edge cases where one activates and one doesn't. The use of MTP in Speedy Trial for Bitcoin Core has been discussed extensively, and reviewers' opinions are summarized in a GitHub comment. As a reminder, anyone can host a meeting on the ##taproot-activation channel by contacting Michael Folkson to book a time slot and ideally posting an agenda to the mailing list in advance of the meeting. The meeting host will have the ability to issue warnings and if necessary, kick participants who are disrupting the meeting or diverting conversation from the agenda.</p>
