    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a rule change regarding emergency backup pre-signed transactions has been put forward in a BIP by Christopher Gilliard. The BIP has been shared on Github and Gilliard has requested feedback from the Bitcoin community. However, one participant, Jeremy Rubin, has raised concerns that the proposed rule change could result in the confiscation of his funds. Rubin claims to have lost the private key to his vault containing emergency backup pre-signed transactions in a boating incident. Despite this, another participant has suggested that the proposal could be implemented without confiscating Rubin's funds and even offered to fund a deep sea diving expedition to find the lost keys for a unit test.</p>
