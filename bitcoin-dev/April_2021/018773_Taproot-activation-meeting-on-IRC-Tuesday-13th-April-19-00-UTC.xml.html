    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing the activation plan for Taproot, which involves reviewing Core PR #21377. Michael Folkson suggests that if this PR is merged into Core, any alternative release must be fully compatible with its activation parameters. However, Jeremy Rubin points out that there is a middle road to consider. If Core chooses not to release activation parameters, then #21377 can still be used to issue a community release safely. This would avoid the false dichotomy between an ST released by Core and a BIP8 UASF. The upcoming Taproot activation meeting on April 13th will focus on ratifying the previously discussed activation plan. There appears to be consensus on BIP8 and other parameters, with sufficient support for LOT=True to proceed safely. Miners have 18 months to signal and accelerate activation, after which taproot will activate regardless. This approach guarantees eventual lock-in of taproot with the smallest chance of a chain split. The channel is open for ongoing discussion, and there is a web chat client available.</p>
