    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard expressed his opinion regarding the proposal to extend the BIP editorship membership on bitcoin-dev mailing list. He believes that if the proposal does not satisfy parties involved or anyone in the community, it should not be sliced by admins of the Bitcoin github org. Antoine thinks that their roles do not bestow to intervene in case of loopholes and defect or uncertainty in the BIP Process shouldn't be solved by GH janitorial roles. He recommends that the BIP editorship, once extended or not, should move in its own repository in the future. Luke Dashjr proposed to add Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to assist in merging PRs into the bips git repo. Since there is no explicit process to adding BIP editors, Luke intends to use BIP 2's Process BIP progression. A Process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. There is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors, so Luke thinks it should be fine. He invites people to speak up soon if they disagree.</p>
