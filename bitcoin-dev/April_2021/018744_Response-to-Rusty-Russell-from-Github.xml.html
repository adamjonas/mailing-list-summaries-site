    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post on bitcoin-dev, developer Rusty Russell disagreed with the idea of using BIP8 with LOT configuration as a long-term solution for Bitcoin's future. He said that while he understood the goal of providing users choice, a regular flag day without signaling but communicated openly may be a better option. He also noted the importance of infrastructure and warned against ignoring it, drawing parallels to the need for elections in government. Russell also explained why a fresh release, rather than individually setting LOT configuration, might be simpler and safer. These reasons include avoiding consensus sensitivity issues, eliminating the risk of missed windows, allowing for a faster soft-fail process, and preventing block invalidation if miners continue without signaling. He acknowledged that this approach isn't perfect but didn't have any genius ideas for making it easier. Finally, Russell discussed the technical aspects of BIP-8 and its effectiveness in preventing forks. He expressed hope that the ecosystem would remain harmonious, but having BIP-8 deployed and ready could provide a safety net if necessary.</p>
