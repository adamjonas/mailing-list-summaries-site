    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke, a member of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) community, has proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to help merge pull requests into the BIP git repository. He suggests using BIP 2's Process BIP progression since there is no explicit process for adding editors. This process states that a proposal can achieve rough consensus once it has been open for discussion on the development mailing list for at least one month, and no unaddressed objections have been raised. Luke believes that opening a new Process BIP for each new editor is unnecessary, and there is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors. However, he invites anyone who disagrees to speak up soon.</p>
