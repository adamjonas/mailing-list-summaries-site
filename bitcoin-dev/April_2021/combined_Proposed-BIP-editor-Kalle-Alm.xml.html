        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) maintainership role may be moving to a bot due to recent events where humans have acted inappropriately. The explicit criteria for the role seems to be manageable by a bot, and ignoring obvious spam is not a requirement. However, there are objections to adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to merge pull requests into the bips git repo. Greg Maxwell expressed opposition to the addition of Kalle Alm, believing that it will not resolve the situation with Luke-jr's inappropriate behavior regarding PR1104. Despite this, Luke intends to add Kalle Alm unless there are objections. Since there is no explicit process for adding BIP editors, Luke suggests using Process BIP progression as outlined in BIP 2, which states that a process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. If anyone feels there is a need for a new Process BIP, they can speak up soon.</p>
