    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process is a platform for Bitcoin developers to propose standards or deployed protocols in any form they wish. The main purpose of the BIP process is to ensure interoperability and not to take positions on anything, according to Matt, who commented on the lack of understanding of the process by some members of the community. The BIP editor's role should be limited to encouraging BIP authors to respond to feedback and formatting standards and should not include taking stances on substantive changes to the contents of a BIP. In a recent meeting, Luke Dashjr proposed adding Kalle Alm as a BIP editor to help merge PRs into the BIP git repository. Antoine Riard opposed having admins of the Bitcoin Github organization slice the matter if the proposal doesn't satisfy parties involved or anyone in the community. He suggested that the BIP editorship should move to its own repository in the future. He believes that procedural forms should be respected and followed, and if there are no explicit procedures for adding BIP editors, then rough consensus should be achieved on the mailing list. There is prior precedent for BIP editors appointing new BIP editors, so Luke believes it should be fine to add Kalle Alm without opening a Process BIP. However, he asked anyone who disagrees to speak up soon. Although the community should work together to improve the Bitcoin system, Matt suggests that they move on and simply ignore the BIP repository entirely. Sending notices of protocol systems to the mailing list is likely sufficient, given that the protocol changes proposed have already been broadly communicated.</p>
