        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Christopher Gilliard, a member of the cryptocurrency community, has created a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that introduces a decentralized naming protocol. This BIP, which can be found on GitHub, is associated with other recent BIPs that have been sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposed protocol aims to provide a more efficient method for naming and identifying various elements within the blockchain network.The protocol outlined in Gilliard's BIP maps names to onion addresses instead of IPs, and it is integrated into the other systems he has proposed. It is worth noting that one respondent to the mailing list mentioned that the protocol appeared similar to Namecoin, a decentralized naming system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, Gilliard did not respond to this comment.At present, there is limited information available regarding how Gilliard's proposal will differ from existing systems like Namecoin or whether it will gain traction in the cryptocurrency community. There have been no further updates or announcements regarding the proposed protocol. Therefore, it remains to be seen how this new naming protocol will be received and if it will bring any significant changes to the cryptocurrency space.For those interested in reviewing the details of Gilliard's BIP or providing feedback, questions, or comments, the BIP can be accessed on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/cgilliard/bips/blob/naming/bip-XXXX.mediawiki">https://github.com/cgilliard/bips/blob/naming/bip-XXXX.mediawiki</a>.</p>
