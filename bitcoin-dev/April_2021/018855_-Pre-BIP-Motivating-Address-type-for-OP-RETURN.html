    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of OP_RETURN addresses in Bitcoin. The original poster expresses annoyance with having to program around them, but acknowledges their historical significance and potential future use for metadata like stealth addresses. Another participant in the discussion raises concerns about the wide range of possibilities that can be represented by script and the potential for inappropriate messages to be encoded in bech32m addresses. However, they note that OP_RETURN addresses have advantages over other address types in terms of allowing more data in scriptSig and being exempt from the dust limit. The discussion also touches on the structure of PSBTs and the possibility of creating a standard OP_RETURN address format. A demonstration is provided showing the creation of an 11,000 byte OP_RETURN on regtest, and the discussion ends with a call for further consideration of the motivation behind such a standard and its potential impact on block chain graffiti.</p>
