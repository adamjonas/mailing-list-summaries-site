    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the statement has expressed disappointment in the lack of rational debates around taproot activation in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) community. They feel that discussions have been lacking logic and instead, filled with irrational arguments appealing to emotions. The author has attempted to make two efforts to speed up the process but was obstructed by ST advocates who intend to paint them as "deliberately refusing" in order to control Bitcoin and the BIP process. The author also expresses frustration towards the community for ignoring their input and participating in irrational debates filled with ad hominem fallacies and insults. Ultimately, the author believes it is Matt, not Luke, who is playing dumb.</p>
