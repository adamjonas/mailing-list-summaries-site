    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 28, 2011, a conversation occurred between Alan Grimes and Gregory Maxwell regarding the use of libdb in bitcoin. During the discussion, Grimes stated that those who believe there are too many vanity versions of bitcoin should consider a version that removes the use of libdb or requires the user to not have its development headers installed on their system. Maxwell then replied stating that even with the headers installed, an error will still occur because the makefile does not add the proper include paths to GCC. He then provided information on how he built his version of bitcoin by first changing the makefile to use dynamic libraries rather than static ones and including specific debug flags. Finally, he used the make command to build bitcoind with the UPNP feature enabled.</p>
