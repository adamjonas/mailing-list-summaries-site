    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo proposed an emergency release, 0.3.24, to address issues with flood control limits. The Bitcoin community is considering this release due to the limits becoming an issue again. The proposed release includes sipa's flood limit fix, enabling UPnP by default and DNS seed on by default. UPnP would increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections, which could help network stability over the next 90 days. Some developers argued against turning on UPnP due to security concerns while others believed it was necessary for network stability. The new DNS seed would fill its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections.IRC connections have been causing security concerns, and until the issue is resolved, none of the other features will be significant from a security perspective. Incentives should be given to listen and reduce the effectiveness of denial-of-service attacks. Bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on the download archives.Matt Corallo suggests updating the checkpoint in version 0.3.24 to address mining difficulties and potential forks. He provides a link to download RC1 builds of the update, which are gitian signed and email signed. However, there are still some issues that need to be fixed before the release regarding build engineering and testing.Jeff Garzik suggests moving forward with the current Git version and fixing bugs along the way, while Gavin Andresen agrees with adding another blockchain checkpoint. There is also discussion about enabling UPnP by default on Windows/Mac but keeping it off-by-default on Linux.</p>
