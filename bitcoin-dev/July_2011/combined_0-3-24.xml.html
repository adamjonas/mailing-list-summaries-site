    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developers of Bitcoin have discussed the need for an emergency release, 0.3.24, to address flood control limits becoming an issue again. The release would include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default, and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well, according to Matt Corallo. He has set up a dynamic DNSSeed that fills its hostname with random nodes that are known to be up and accepting connections. As it is no longer a static list, he believes it is time to enable dnsseed by default.In addition, Corallo thinks enabling UPnP by default would be beneficial as it could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. However, there was a forum poll where people were divided on whether UPnP should be turned on or off. Some users do not like UPnP but they still support it for the network's health. Users who do not like it can still disable listening. It is healthier for the network right now than leaving listening on but not actually working.To ensure network stability over the next 90 days, the developers agreed on the necessity of a new release. They decided to turn UPnP on by default on bitcoin, while it should remain off-by-default on Linux bitcoind. The developers also agreed to include a block send limit, no-connect segfault bugfix, and another blockchain checkpoint. They estimated that there are around 4000 stable listening nodes, and getting more listening nodes was considered an urgent matter. A new checkpoint was proposed because difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently present. Builds for the update were made available for testing purposes.It is worth noting that there was no public outcry against programs automatically opening holes in firewalls. Therefore, the developers decided to turn on UPnP by default. However, some users do not like this feature. Nonetheless, it is necessary for the network's health at present. The developers suggested testing CWallet before crypto and 0.4 are released to ensure that the update works correctly.</p>
