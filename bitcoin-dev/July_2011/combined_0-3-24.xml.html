        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is preparing for a 0.3.24 release due to the issue of flood control limits. The release will include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed enabled by default, and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. Matt Corallo has set up a DNSSeed with reliable hosting that has been added to master, so he believes it is time to enable dnsseed by default. He also suggests that UPnP should be turned on by default as it could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. There is some concern about the UPnP fixes in pull 358, but this is not seen as an alternative to turning it off.There is also discussion regarding whether IRC connections are more concerning than UPnP. In the end, someone has to make the tough decision and turn it on. In terms of network health, enabling it for the GUI is probably sufficient. Bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on the download archives.Pieter Wuille agreed with both suggestions and added that there should be a block send limit and no-connect segfault bugfix in the emergency release 0.3.24. Matt Corallo further suggested updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 due to the increased difficulty of mining since the highest one currently in there. This could result in a large number of parties mining forks at lower difficulty for nodes that they've sibyled. Matt Corallo provides a link for Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1 builds available at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/Bitcoin%200.3.24%20RC1.tar.bz2">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/Bitcoin%200.3.24%20RC1.tar.bz2</a> with SHA1 verification and gitian signed and email signed as always. However, he notes that some things need fixing up before release regarding build engineering. Jeff Garzik suggests moving forward with git tip + whatever is needed to fix bugs in current tip as his preference. Gavin Andresen agrees to dnsseed on, block send, segfault bugfix and adding another block-chain checkpoint. He also thinks upnp should be enabled on Windows/Mac but remain off-by-default on Linux. Matt Corallo has little preference about cherry-pick or broad-base test of CWallet in 0.3.24 so potential bugs can be found in it before crypto and 0.4.</p>
