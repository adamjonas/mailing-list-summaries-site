    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community has identified the need for a 0.3.24 release to address flood control limits. One of the key fixes in this release is sipa's flood limit fix, which will help prevent DOS attacks. Additionally, DNS seed will be enabled by default, as it has been set up with reliable hosting that dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. The community also sees no reason why UPnP shouldn't be enabled by default, as it could help increase the percent of nodes that accept incoming connections. Despite concerns about UPnP's impact on individual bandwidth usage, its benefits for the network mean that it will likely be turned on. To further incentivize node operators to listen to the network, preferred forwarding from/to nodes that we've connected to vs connected to us and improved relay rules may also be introduced. These measures would reduce the effectiveness of some DOS attacks and reduce the effect of UPnP on individual bandwidth usage. Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo has suggested that the UPnP feature should be enabled by default in Bitcoin. He believes that this would increase the number of nodes accepting incoming connections, as other P2P applications like Skype have UPnP enabled by default. Corallo also suggests enabling Domain Name System seeding (DNS), which would allow users to connect to nodes without having to manually enter their IP addresses. The DNS seed would be dynamic to prevent problems with outages of DNS seeds.There are a few things that still need to be fixed up before the 0.3.24 release, particularly with respect to build engineering. Jeff Garzik suggests moving forward with git tip and fixing bugs in the current tip, while Gavin Andresen thinks UPnP should be enabled on Windows/Mac but remain off-by-default on Linux. Another option under consideration is adding another block-chain checkpoint. In summary, the Bitcoin community is preparing for a 0.3.24 release to address flood control limits and improve the network's health and security. Key fixes include sipa's flood limit fix, enabling DNS seed by default, and possibly enabling UPnP. To incentivize node operators to listen to the network, preferred forwarding from/to nodes that we've connected to vs connected to us and improved relay rules may also be introduced. There are still a few things that need to be fixed up before the release, but the community is working proactively to ensure that Bitcoin remains a secure and reliable cryptocurrency.</p>
