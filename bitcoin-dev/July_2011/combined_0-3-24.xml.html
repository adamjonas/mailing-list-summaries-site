    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo has proposed a 0.3.24 release to address network stability issues caused by flood control limits. The release would include sipa's flood limit fix, DNS seed on by default and potentially UPnP enabled by default as well. The DNS seed feature dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections, while UPnP could increase the number of nodes which accept incoming connections. In addition to these proposed changes, Matt Corallo suggests fixing the no-connections-up segfault and updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24. Since the difficulty has increased almost 17 times since the highest one currently in there, he suggested increasing the nLimit in sipa's code from 500 to 5,000 to reduce sync-up times. He also made available the builds of Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1, which is gitian signed and email signed, but noted that a few things still need fixing before release regarding build engineering.Other developers, including Pieter Wuille, have expressed their support for the proposal. Wuille suggested increasing the nLimit in sipa's code from 500 to 5,000, while Jeff Garzik proposed that they move forward with git tip + whatever they need to fix bugs in the current tip. The issue of enabling UPnP by default was also discussed. While some believe it could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections, others are concerned about potential security risks. A forum poll was used to decide whether or not UPnP should be enabled, but Matt Corallo believes that this was not the right tool to use to decide if bitcoin keeps working or not. Users who don't like the idea of UPnP can still disable listening, which is healthier for the network right now than leaving listening on but not actually working.Gavin Andresen recommended that UPnP be enabled on Windows/Mac but remain off-by-default on Linux. The group also agreed to add another block-chain checkpoint. Overall, the proposed 0.3.24 release aims to address network stability issues and improve the functionality of Bitcoin.</p>
