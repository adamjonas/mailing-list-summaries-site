    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers are discussing an emergency release, version 0.3.24, to address flood control limits that are causing issues in the network. The proposed release will include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default, and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. DNS seeds were static lists before but with Matt Corallo's work, it is now a dynamic list that fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. He has set up one such seed at dnsseed.bluematt.me. Enabling UPnP by default could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connection and other P2P applications, which depend on the ability to accept incoming connections, have it on by default as well. It is also suggested that fixing no-connections-up segfault should be included in this release.Matt Corallo has suggested updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 as difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1 builds are available and have been gitian signed and email signed as always. However, a couple of things need to be fixed up before release regarding build engineering.Jeff Garzik has proposed cherry-picking 0.3.23 + select fixes or current upstream + pull #358. Gavin Andresen agrees with enabling UPnP on Windows/Mac but remaining off-by-default on Linux with dnsseed on, block send and segfault bugfix agreed upon. Another block-chain checkpoint is also being considered.A DNSSeed has been set up with reliable hosting, which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. This will allow the network to increase the number of nodes accepting incoming connections. It is suggested that UPnP should be enabled by default as it could increase the percent of nodes which accept incoming connections. To fix the no-connections-up segfault, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3a3eabb57ae41dd2162ca8230423abf4a90ef644">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3a3eabb57ae41dd2162ca8230423abf4a90ef644</a> should be included. A bug was found where it no longer opened ("Error: unable to load wallet.dat") when the ~/.bitcoin folder was empty/not present.A forum poll has been done to decide whether or not to leave UPnP on or off, but a poll on the forum may not be the best way to make decisions about bitcoin. Enabling it for the GUI is sufficient in terms of network health. However, users who don't like it can still disable listening. It was suggested that we should give preference in the form of preferred forwarding from/to to nodes that we've connected to vs connected to us, potentially improved relay rules. We can fix the incentive structure somewhat: We should give preference in the form of preferred forwarding from/to to nodes that we've connected to vs connected to us, potentially improved relay rules. Not something for 0.3.24, however.</p>
