    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and JS on July 27, 2011, the former asked for advice on how to encourage more bug-fixing and testing of existing functionality rather than adding new features. JS suggested making a list of bugs and offering BTC bounties for fixing each one based on their severity and difficulty. This approach would interest people in the project's current source base instead of wanting to create another incomplete client from scratch. Another suggestion was to offer bounties for finding new security holes and serious bugs similar to the Mozilla/Chrome projects. However, a policy that prohibits considering new features until open bugs are closed is unlikely to work as it is an open-source project where people can make their own fork with new features without fixing any bugs.</p>
