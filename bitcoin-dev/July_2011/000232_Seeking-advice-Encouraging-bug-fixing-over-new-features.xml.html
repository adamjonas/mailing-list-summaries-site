    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The founder of Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen, has expressed concern about the constant addition of features to the software, rather than fixing existing bugs. He plans on leading by example and tackling the backlog of reported bugs upon his return from Australia. Andresen is seeking advice on how to encourage others to prioritize bug-fixing and testing over adding more features. He questions whether policies like "no new features until open bugs are closed" would be effective or if it would lead to trivial issues being raised to meet requirements. The importance of ensuring that existing features work correctly is highlighted as several people have lost money due to bugs slipping through. Andresen thanks those who have been testing and submitting bug fixes and acknowledges that not everyone has been focused on adding new features.</p>
