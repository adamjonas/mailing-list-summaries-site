    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The need for a unique Bitcoin address per transaction can be alleviated according to a proposal made by Rick. He suggests resolving "foo at bar.net" using a SRV lookup for "_bitcoinaddressresolution._tcp.foo.bar.net", expecting a certificate for bar.net. This approach also involves making an HTTPS request for "/bitcoinaddressresolution?foo at bar.net" and sending an email to foo at bar.net, signed with keys used for the transaction. It is important to note that emails are not merely domains and there could be other options for addressing transactions. Additionally, the claim that DNSSEC is on the verge of becoming illegal in the US has been challenged as DHS was a major funder for DNSSEC and .mil was the first domain to deploy it.</p>
