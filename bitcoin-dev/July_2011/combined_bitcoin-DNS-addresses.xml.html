    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Rick Wesson and Matt, the topic of discussion was the use of DNSSEC or HTTPS for name resolution to prevent potential MITM attacks on Bitcoin addresses. Rick pointed out that DNSSEC is not a security measure for DNS resolution but requires its own DNSSEC enabled stub resolver. In contrast, Matt preferred using HTTPS because it allows giving different addresses to each client based on IP, which is challenging to achieve with DNS. He also mentioned that there are many HTTPS libraries available with more thorough security audits than DNSSEC-implementing DNS recursion libraries.Rick argued for the usability and user experience of DNS, stating that he believes DNSSEC provides reasonable security for transactions and that DNS mapping doesn't prevent or deny anyone from leveraging HTTP(S) for similar mapping. However, Matt still sees clear advantages for using HTTPS over DNS, such as ease of offering up different addresses to different people and no clear advantage for using DNS over HTTPS.In a Bitcoin forum, Rick Wesson asked if anyone has written the https-address-resolver-easy-button for bitcoind. Another user commented that it has already been written twice, but the original poster's mail client was not responding on-list. The conversation then shifted to the security implications of using DNSSEC for Bitcoin address communication. The user suggested using a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support instead of DNS because DNS is insecure to transmit something that will result in money transfer. He added that using URIs is much simpler and can be more useful in terms of being able to give different addresses and/or values per user.In response, the original poster disagreed and said he had joined the list to produce a patch to sendtoaddress in rpc.cpp to support DNS lookups so that one could publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coin. However, the other user still believed that DNS-based resolving is not a good idea, and HTTPS has several advantages over a DNSSEC-based solution without any significant drawbacks.</p>
