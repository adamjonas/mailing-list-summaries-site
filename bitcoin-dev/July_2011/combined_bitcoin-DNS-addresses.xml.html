    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Rick Wesson and Matt focused on the use of DNS and HTTPS for resolving Bitcoin addresses. Rick believed that DNSSEC was a good solution to protect against MITM attacks on DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses, while Matt disagreed. He argued that DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses was bad due to potential MITM attacks, and DNSSEC was not a security measure for mitigating DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses. Instead, Matt preferred using HTTPS over DNS as it allowed for giving different addresses to each client based on IP more easily. Rick countered by saying that DNS offered some advantages, such as ease of offering up different mapping by IP address and frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity. However, Matt saw clear advantages for using HTTPS mapping over DNS and saw no clear advantage for using DNS over HTTPS. They discussed the pros and cons of both methods in terms of usability and user experience.In the email thread, Rick asked if anyone had written an HTTPS-address-resolver-easy-button for bitcoind. Matt replied that it had already been written twice and pointed out the vulnerability of DNS in transmitting money transfer due to its insecurity. He suggested that using HTTPS was better in the end because it was more secure and could give different addresses and/or values per user.Rick suggested working on a patch to support DNS lookups so that one could publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coin. However, Matt pointed out that DNS-based resolving was not a good idea here and suggested using HTTPS instead, which had several advantages without any significant drawbacks.</p>
