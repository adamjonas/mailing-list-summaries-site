    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author expresses skepticism about the idea of offering bounties for fixing bugs, as they believe it could cause more problems than it solves. They ask if anyone has experience with cash bounties in other projects, particularly on run-of-the-mill bugs, and whether this caused any issues. The author is concerned that offering bounties will change the dynamic from cooperative to competitive and discourage contributors from asking for help, for fear of losing out on the bounty. They express support for the ideas of a road-map and bug-fix-only releases, but do not comment further. Additionally, the author mentions that they arranged to get paid to work on Bitcoin full-time before leaving for Australia, but will provide more details upon their return in a week's time.</p>
