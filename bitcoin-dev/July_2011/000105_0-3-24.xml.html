    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There was a misunderstanding regarding the release of Bitcoin software on IRC. People were discussing a cherry-picked release, which is version 0.3.23 with some specific fixes, instead of the latest version in upstream git. The disadvantages of cherry-picked branches include zero testing and the potential for bug reports that may not apply to any other version. However, release management rules are more like guidelines. A cherry-picked 0.3.24 release would not need to worry about shipping CWallet, which needs a fix from pull #358 in GitHub. The decision between releasing (a) 0.3.23 + select fixes or (b) current upstream + pull #358 will be made by the community and Holy Alpaca. Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. would prefer option (b), but welcomes comments.</p>
