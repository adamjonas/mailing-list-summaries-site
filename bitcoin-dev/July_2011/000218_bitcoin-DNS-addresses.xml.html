    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new member has joined a list with the goal of creating a patch to support DNS lookups in rpc.cpp for bitcoin transactions. The proposed code works but needs additional error handling. In addition, the member is working on an internet draft to describe how to put bitcoin addresses in the DNS, which they hope to post the first draft of this week. They are seeking comments on issues around anonymity, community push back, and any other concerns related to leveraging the DNS for these transactions. The proposed code for sendtoaddress is included in the provided context.</p>
