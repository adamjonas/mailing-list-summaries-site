    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from July 1, 2011, members of the Bitcoin community debated whether UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) should be turned on by default. Gavin Andresen shared a poll that showed 20% of respondents were in favor of having UPnP on by default, while 55% were against it. The remaining 25% favored having UPnP on by default in the GUI but off in bitcoind. Jan at uos.de later reported that the results had shifted to an even split between those who wanted UPnP on and those who didn't. Douglas Huff argued that network stability was more important than convenience and that the default setting would only apply to pre-built binaries, so users running bitcoind wouldn't be affected either way.</p>
