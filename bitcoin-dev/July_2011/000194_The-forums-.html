    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 16, 2011, Matt Corallo proposed that a simpler forum would be easier to moderate if there were enough people with moderation power. The main criteria for a helpful forum is its usefulness to users, and if it doesn't meet this criterion, then the forum should be locked or removed. Two categories could be created: Technical Support and Development. The Development category could be split up between client work and other software/websites integrating bitcoin. If there is a large enough group in a certain country that is also willing to maintain order, then these categories can be replicated per language. Although JS has no problem volunteering some time moderating, he does not want to do so on the current forums. JS believes that removing the link and coming up with an alternative medium to address user issues, such as a moderated mailing list, would solve the capacity issue. However, he doesn't believe that capacity is the root of the problem. He claims that there are many successful forums that have picked the right structure and helpful moderators, and many of them are volunteer-driven.</p>
