    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on July 10, 2011, Michael Offel expressed concerns about the long build times for Bitcoin. He noted that it takes longer to build Bitcoin than other projects he is working on, which have millions of lines of code. He attributes this to the use of boost, a lack of module isolation, and implementations in header files. Offel offered to fix the latter on IRC, but was told that a pull removing implementations from the headers would not be merged due to its size. This contributes to long build times and makes adding new code in the right places difficult because of build dependencies. Douglas Huff responded to Offel's email, agreeing with his points and suggesting that they be discussed further and addressed.</p>
