    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message encountered a problem after syncing to the latest git version and initially thought it was an issue with their UI. However, upon inspecting a screenshot, they discovered that addresses were missing in the detailed transaction view. They traced the problem to a section of script.cpp that only returned "true" for keys in the keystore. After commenting out a line of code, the display was fixed, but the author is concerned that this solution may have unintended consequences.</p>
