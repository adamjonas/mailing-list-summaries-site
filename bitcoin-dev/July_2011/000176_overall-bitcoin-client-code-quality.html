    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Mike Hearn suggests a complete rewrite of the code rather than just moving functional code around. He references an old essay by Joel Spolsky that supports his suggestion. Another contributor agrees that more documentation and understandable interfaces would be helpful but sees no need for a complete rewrite. They suggest some refactoring instead of reproducing every detail in a rewrite. The idea that Boost is a nonstandard dependency is questioned as it is derived from a large part of the new C++0x standard. Also, build speed is not seen as a major concern due to faster and smarter C++ compilers. Finally, a few pull requests have been submitted to replace hardcoded magic values with constants, but there is no need to move these constants to a config file since end-users typically do not need to change them.</p>
