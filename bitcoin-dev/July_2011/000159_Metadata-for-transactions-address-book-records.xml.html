    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developer is seeking to associate metadata with transactions and address book records for UI purposes. The metadata will be completely client-side and not visible on the blockchain. For transactions, the current idea is to include a description field that users can fill in after sending or receiving a payment, such as "ordered eggs". For address book records, there is a proposal to include a boolean field to indicate if the address should be visible in the interface, which would be useful for hiding old addresses without removing them from lookup purposes. The developer is open to adding more metadata in the future, such as accounting categories and links to 3rd party services, and prefers an extensible system. They are seeking ideas on where to implement this while minimizing core changes. The developer acknowledges that this could be implemented within the UI code but prefers to avoid putting database handling there and creating additional data files for users to manage.</p>
