    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Stéphane Gimenez and an unknown person took place on July 16, 2011. Stéphane shares a proposal that associates generations txouts with the appropriate addresses and accounts. He also mentions that the GitHub link he has shared is very broken and that he came up with a workable solution. The proposal includes the addition of wallet categories for all transactions. The unknown person suggests that either the wallet should always be categorized as "receive" or that webservices should only rely on the sign of amounts. They also suggest adding a "type" field with values "credit"/"debit" to allow for more categories to be added in the future. Finally, they mention that "move" is a positive amount but does not change the actual value in the wallet.</p>
