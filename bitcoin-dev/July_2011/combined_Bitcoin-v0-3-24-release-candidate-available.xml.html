        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin v0.3.24 release candidate #1 is now available for download on SourceForge. This version is a bug fix release that includes various fixes, such as block downloads failing or taking too much time, and crashes caused by loss of network connection. DNS seeding is enabled by default in this version, and UPNP is enabled by default in the GUI client to help increase the percentage of bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections. The internal wallet code has been cleaned up to provide the basis for wallet encryption in the next release (v0.4). Other changes include the addition of Boost unit-testing framework, updated translations, and some header file optimizations. Wallet encryption is ready for testing at GitHub and is expected to be included in the next release.Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3 has been released with a quick release being recommended due to the network issues. Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc. posted the release and noted that fixes were added after 0.3.24rc2 was tagged and there might be a final release on Friday. Gavin Andresen made two changes to do with blockchain lock-in at 134444 and not using a comma as thousands separator. Matt Corallo added a couple minor things to match newer build process, reverted "Make UPnP default on Bitcoin but not on Bitcoind" and enabled UPnP by default on bitcoin, but not on bitcoind (on gitian). Pieter Wuille fixed synchronization of default key. The release includes PGP signatures for each file.Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3 has been uploaded, with fixes that appeared after -rc2 was tagged, so the developers skipped straight to -rc3. The release includes various bugfixes and improvements, such as block-chain lock-in at 134444, a fix for synchronization of default key, and a fix for AddressBook synchronization between a CWallet and CWalletDB. The release also includes a move wallet code to separate file, CWallet class, and Limit response to getblocks to half of output buffer size. Moreover, it includes a fix for missing includes needed for Boost 1.46. There is also an addition of GetTotalBlocksEstimate() function, moving magic number to constant. Jeff Garzik suggested a quick release, as the network is getting sick. Though there seems to be some kind of shutdown issue, it is not relevant for this release. A final release for Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3 was planned for Friday.Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3 has been uploaded by Jeff Garzik with fixes that appeared after -rc2 was tagged. The latest release includes changes made by Gavin Andresen, Matt Corallo, and Pieter Wuille, such as block-chain lock-in at 134444, not using comma as thousands separator, fixing synchronization of default key, and enabling UPnP by default on bitcoin, but not on bitcoind (on gitian). Though the release is not relevant for this version, there seems to be some kind of shutdown issue where the parent process didn't quit, leaving a zombie. A quick release would be good to address the growing network issues.Full changelog is available on the website. Contributions are welcome for the testing of wallet encryption.</p>
