        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin has released version 0.3.24rc3, which includes fixes to block downloads that were failing or taking unreasonable amounts of time to complete due to the increased size of the block chain bumping up against some earlier buffer-size DoS limits. The release also includes wallet encryption for testing and DNS seeding enabled by default and UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client. A unit testing framework has also been included. Another change is the internal wallet code cleanup that provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption. Bitcoin's network is getting slow, and there is speculation that the final release may be out on Friday. Fixes since 0.3.24rc1 include block-chain lock-in at 134444 and a fix to synchronization of default key, among others. The new version is available for download on Linux, Windows, and source, with links provided in the announcement. A forum user had an issue with shutdown, but the developer suggests that it might be related to the corrupted addr.dat file.In addition to the release information, the release documentation also includes a list of contributors and their specific contributions. The documentation also includes PGP signatures and hashes for the various files included in the release. These measures are taken to ensure the security and reliability of the software being released. By including this information, users can be confident that the release they are downloading is legitimate and has not been tampered with.Overall, the release documentation provides transparency and accountability for the contributions made to the release. Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. encourages people to make sense of generated data using Splunk.</p>
