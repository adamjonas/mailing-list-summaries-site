    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this context is advocating for the Bitcoin Stack-Exchange to be the main user/merchant support site. The writer believes that the format of the Stack Exchange is ideal because the acceptable and unacceptable topics are defined in advance, and it has a good user moderation/reputation system. The site will only allow technical and conceptual questions, with no politics, philosophy, buying, or selling. This will make the site unattractive to kooks, hucksters, and trolls. However, as of the writing of this context, the site still needs 64 more people to commit to using it before it can launch, with 48 of those people needing to be established Stack Exchange users. The writer hopes that the site will be up by the end of August but would like it to happen sooner, so they are encouraging people to join up.</p>
