    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests that a complete rewrite of the Bitcoin code is needed, taking inspiration from the old code. While there are efforts to write a fresh implementation, such as BitCoinJ, it is not a complete implementation and currently targets simplified payment verification mode for mobile phones. The long-term goal is for it to evolve into a full node. The author also mentions an old essay on the topic that they believe is still relevant. The code was originally written by Satoshi, who is no longer around to have feelings about any criticism of the code.</p>
