    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Rick Wesson and Matt, they discussed the use of DNSSEC for Bitcoin transactions. Rick suggested that using email addresses as labels for Bitcoin addresses could help with memorization. He also believed in the security offered by DNSSEC for transactions, but noted that implementation would require a full recursive nameserver inside of Bitcoin with hardcoded root trust anchors. Additionally, HTTPS mapping offers advantages such as ease of offering different mappings to different people based on IP address. While DNS is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity, HTTPS mapping does not offer the same advantage. Rick argued that incorporating Bitcoin into DNS might make DNSSEC more popular, but Matt doubted it would make a significant difference given the small size of the Bitcoin community.</p>
