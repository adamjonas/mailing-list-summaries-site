    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille initiated a discussion on IRC to standardize the version bytes used by Bitcoin for various applications. The three meaningful components that were identified were network (realnet, testnet, alternate chains), data class (address, private key, master key, etc.), and version (real version per data class defined). While there is no technical reason why different networks and data classes would need separate version bytes, it was suggested that it would be a good thing to keep them from colliding since people tend to mix them up. For this reason, bit 16 in the version byte was reserved for "alternate chain" since Namecoin already uses version byte 52 for addresses. Regarding realnet and testnet, the problem was that testnet already uses version 111, which is not a single bit. To resolve this issue, bit 1 was chosen for testnet, and if bit 1 is set, XOR the rest of the version number with 111. Otherwise, testnet could be reset (not actually reset, just change its addresses a bit), and simply state odd=testnet, even=realnet. This left six more bits to play with, namely 128, 64, 32, 8, 4, 2. As 128 is already used for private keys, (128, 64, 32) were chosen for data classes, and (8,4,2) for versions.The following summarizes the proposal: Bits 128/64/32 define data class, Bit 16 defines "private," Bits 8/4/2 define version number, and Bit 1 defines testnet. nVersion of less than 5 in absolute value can cause the first base58 character to remain equal. Pieter suggested using data class 192 for defining a format for master keys from which to derive deterministic wallet keys, leaving the lower numbers for more basic data, like public keys.</p>
