    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin users have decided to standardize the version bytes used for several applications and try to keep them from colliding. The three components that seem meaningful are network (realnet, testnet, alternate chains), data class (address, private key, master key, etc.), and version (real version, per data class defined). Currently, namecoin is using version byte 52 for addresses, so they would like to reserve bit 16 in the version byte for “alternate chain”. When bit 16 is set, everything is up to the network itself, and no further semantics are defined. For non-alternate chains, bit 1 can be used to define testnet and if bit 1 is set, XOR the rest of the version number with 111. Otherwise, odd = testnet, even = realnet. That leaves us with 6 more bits to play with, 128,64,32 and 8,4,2. As 128 is already used for private keys, 128, 64, and 32 will be used for data classes, and 8, 4, and 2 for versions. The discussion started when Stefan wanted to define a format for master keys from which to derive deterministic wallet keys. They proposed using data class 192 for that, leaving the lower numbers for more basic data, like public keys. Pieter Wuille suggested some conventions he thinks should be adopted before everyone starts defining their own. He also provided a proposal that summarizes the convention.</p>
