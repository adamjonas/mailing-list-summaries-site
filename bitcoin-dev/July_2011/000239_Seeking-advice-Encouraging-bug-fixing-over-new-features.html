    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion regarding a bounty system for Bitcoin development, Luke expressed his tendency to say that anything not related to a base16 number representation system is not worth worrying about. However, the discussion continued with other contributors suggesting a separated-from-GitHub bounty system, but with the caveat that the bounties must go into some form of escrow to ensure they are paid out. John Smith suggested creating a list of bounties on a separate website and linking to GitHub issues for descriptions if necessary. The group concluded that technical details and GitHub TOS were not important to discuss at this point and focused on the merit of ideas.</p>
