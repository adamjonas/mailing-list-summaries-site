    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It appears that there is some confusion regarding the differentiation of operating systems, particularly as it pertains to bitcoin. A poll was conducted on the Bitcoin forum in regards to this issue, with three options presented: On by default, off by default, and on by default in the GUI but off by default in bitcoind. According to the results, 20% of respondents indicated that the option was on by default, while 55% said that it was off by default. The remaining 25% stated that it was on by default in the GUI but off by default in bitcoind.Upon reviewing the aforementioned poll, it seems that the original poster had mis-remembered its contents. The poll's results suggest that the option was not disabled by default on bitcoind, as previously believed. It is unclear at this time what the implications of this new information are, or whether any changes will be made in response. Overall, it appears that there may be some uncertainty surrounding this issue, and further research may be necessary to fully understand the situation.</p>
