        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2011, the implementation of IsStandard transactions was being discussed via email thread. The goal was to upgrade over 30% of mining power to allow for these transactions to be mined in under an hour. However, concerns were raised about propagation and vulnerability to double spending. To address this issue, it was suggested to split pull request 319 into two requests. This would allow for the IsStandard change to be implemented quickly and ensure the network could handle the full escrow feature set when added later.Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell had implemented a multiple signature escrowed transaction system that he believed should be added to the client soon. However, it required more testing and discussion before implementation. One challenge with its implementation was that it needed a new transaction type, which made it undeployable until an updated isStandard was widely used in the network.Maxwell also identified an issue with multisig validation caused by redundancy in script length coding opcodes. This redundancy allows coding of a script multiple ways, leading to signature validation failures when the new script is not coded the same way as the original one. Pull request 349 contains a candidate fix for this issue, but there is a risk of creating differences in how nodes validate transactions leading to lasting forks.Alternatively, changing the templating code to ensure it codes the template the same way as the original was coded would be beneficial if the same class of problem exists for other things besides length coding.Bobby Groff expressed hope that building secure deposit systems would improve trust in the ecosystem and emphasized the need for unit testing. Pull request 349 is considered necessary due to the demise of clearcoin.</p>
