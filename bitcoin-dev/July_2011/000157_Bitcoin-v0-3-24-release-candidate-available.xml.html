    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Bitcoin forum user seeks a quick release because the network is getting slow. A developer has uploaded Bitcoin 0.3.24rc3, which contains fixes that appeared after -rc2 was tagged. However, there seems to be some kind of shutdown issue. The user stopped the Bitcoin and waited for the log to indicate successful shutdown, but the parent process didn't quit and became a zombie. They had to do a kill -9 on the parent to get rid of it, and then the addr.dat file became corrupted. They had to remove it and the "database" directory as running the db_recover command didn't work.Changes since 0.3.24rc1 include:- Block-chain lock-in at 134444- Do not use comma as thousands separator- Added a couple minor things to match newer build process- Revert "Make UPnP default on Bitcoin but not on Bitcoind."- Enable UPnP by default on bitcoin, but not on bitcoind (on gitian)- Fix synchronization of default keyThe developer suggests the final release may be out on Friday. A PGP-signed message with hash values has been posted for Linux and Windows versions. Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. shares how all generated data in IT infrastructure is valuable and contains a record of application performance, security threats, fraudulent activity, and more. He encourages people to make sense of this data using Splunk.</p>
