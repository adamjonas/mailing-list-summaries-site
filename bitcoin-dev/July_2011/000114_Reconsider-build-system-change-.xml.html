    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Matt Corallo and JS, they discuss the use of build systems in software development. Corallo mentions that the decision of which build system to use would be up to the developer, but suggests that autotools is more standard than CMake. JS counters by stating that CMake is also very standard and available in many Linux distributions, such as Debian and Fedora/Redhat. They note that installing CMake is not a big issue, as it is a simple command like apt-get install cmake for Debian users. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of choosing a reliable build system in software development and the availability of options such as autotools and CMake.</p>
