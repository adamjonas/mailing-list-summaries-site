    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the need for an update release of Bitcoin Core software version 0.3.24 due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. This release is intended to have several fixes including sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default, and maybe UPnP enabled by default as well. The author mentions that slow bringups are problematic and flood disconnects have been contributing to network partitioning. He has been running the new release for a couple of hours on a large public node which was seeing frequent flood disconnects, and it seems to be working fine. No more flood disconnects. The author suggests getting more listening nodes because linear extrapolation from the two-day lfnet growth leave us running out of sockets in a little more than a month. While it won't all break if it runs out, since we don't strictly need 8 connections, it's still not good. The author also suggests updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24. Difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. A rather large number of parties could mine pretty nice forks at 1/16th the current difficulty for nodes that they've sibyled. The author also mentions that Linux has historically had the most testing of the miniupnpc library, making it the most stable of the three. Lastly, the email contains a signature that promotes Splunk, which makes sense of IT infrastructure data containing vital records of application performance, security threats, fraudulent activity, and more.</p>
