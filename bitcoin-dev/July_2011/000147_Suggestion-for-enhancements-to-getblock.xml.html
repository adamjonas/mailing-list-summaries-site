    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The client is interested in calculating a balance for certain addresses without requiring the entire blockchain. The purpose of this is for a lightweight client to verify dependencies recursively when receiving a transaction. While it is more efficient to verify the merkle branch, the speaker is unsure of how a filter would help as they need all transactions pending in the last ten minutes. However, if the client only cares about transactions sending coins to them, then that would be fine. The speaker suggests using 'getblocks' instead of introducing a new command, but it is mentioned that it's fine to introduce new commands as old clients will just ignore them.</p>
