    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joel Joonatan Kaartinen, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his surprise about the absence of paid community developers working on Bitcoin. He suggested that bounties would be a more democratic way of guiding progress and allowing things to happen without a stable flow of money. He also mentioned that if it was feasible, hiring someone full-time to work on the software would be great. However, he was unable to provide any financial support for that himself. Joel proposed contributing towards bug bounties but said that if there was a bug he wanted to offer bounty for, he would fix it himself.Rick Wesson replied to Joel's suggestion, saying that offering a bounty on the person to lead the effort, rather than on the bugs, would be more effective in finding the right technical lead to improve the software. Luke-Jr added that a few small bounties would not justify agreeing to GitHub's steep demand for potentially unlimited money in their terms of service. John Smith supported Joel's idea of adding a way for anyone to contribute to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker, and also suggested having a listing page for bugs with their bounties. However, he was unsure if the GitHub bug tracker supports extension attributes. People could let others know they are already working on a feature using a comment to prevent double work. The email thread ended with a message inviting people to take a quick survey online to win $100 to spend on ThinkGeek.</p>
