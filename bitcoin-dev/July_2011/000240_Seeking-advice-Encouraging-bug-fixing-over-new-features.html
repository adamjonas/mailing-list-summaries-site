    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin-development mailing list, Joel Joonatan Kaartinen suggested putting bounties on bugs to encourage developers to fix them. Luke-Jr also added that there should be a way for anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker and a listing page for bugs with their bounties might be nice too. However, Rick suggested it would be more effective to put a bounty on the person to lead the effort rather than on the bugs. John Smith also pointed out that the github bug tracker may not support extension attributes but people can let others know they're already working on a feature using a comment to prevent double work. Luke-Jr expressed concerns about GitHub's steep demand for potentially unlimited money in their terms of service and whether small bounties would justify it.</p>
