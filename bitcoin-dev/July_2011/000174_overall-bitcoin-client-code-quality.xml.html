    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is facing difficulties in writing a bitcoin daemon due to design problems, specifically managing connections and peers and interpreting messages. While examining the old code, the author noticed that the 1 class-per .h/.cpp rule was ignored in main.h/cpp and net.h/cpp, which could be fixed easily by refactoring all classes into their own files. This would make it easier to audit interactions between different classes. The author estimates that this work could be completed within 16 programmer hours. Although the old codebase does not build on the author's system, they are willing to proceed with the refactoring effort. The author suggests that this should be done in parallel with other efforts to re-implement major functionality. The final statement made by the author is "Powers are not rights."</p>
