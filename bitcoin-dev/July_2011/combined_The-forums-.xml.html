    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion about the official Bitcoin forums has been brought up, with some suggesting that they should be removed from bitcoin.org and replaced with a more focused forum. The proposed new forum would only aim to help users of Bitcoin, merchants, and developers, without any political or economic speculation or repeated discussions of topics already covered in the FAQ. It was suggested that if an official forum is linked on bitcoin.org, it should be a neutral place that helps people adopt the technology. Some have also suggested that the development project should move to a new URL, as the current forums are giving Bitcoin a bad name due to illegal activity and other unhelpful content. However, there is a lack of modding power to create a more focused forum. It was also noted that only Sirius has keys to the Bitcoin.org DNS.</p>
