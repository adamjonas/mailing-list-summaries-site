    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion occurred on the bitcoin-development mailing list in 2011 about adopting a new build system for the bitcoin codebase. John Smith asked why autotools was chosen instead of CMake, which supports Make, XCode, and Visual Studio. He listed several reasons why CMake might be preferred, including its clearer syntax and speed. However, it was noted that autotools is more standard than CMake and doesn't require installation since it's a shell script. Someone else added that CMake also supports cross-compiling. Pieter Wuille, who had no preference for either system, suggested that the best system would be one that's easy to set up, allows for building on multiple Linux distros, supports cross-compilation to Windows and OSX, is easy to maintain, and can be adapted by other GUIs like bitcoin-qt and cocoabitcoin.</p>
