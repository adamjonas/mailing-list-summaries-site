    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There has been a conversation around whether to merge Autotools or CMake as the future build system for Bitcoin. While Autotools was initially submitted, the general consensus is that it needs redoing before merging. Some people have pointed out that Autotools is more standard than CMake and doesn't require installation, unlike CMake which doesn't come pre-installed on most distros. However, some members believe that CMake would be a better choice as it generates native build scripts for Make, XCode and Visual Studio, and has a clearer syntax compared to Autotools. Additionally, CMake is faster and widely used in many open-source applications like QT and KDE. A CMake build system for Bitcoin is already integrated into rpcminer. Pieter Wuille has expressed no preference for any specific project build system and is open to using any system that meets the following criteria: ease of set up, cross-platform compatibility, support for multiple Linux distributions, cross-compilation to Windows, OSX support, maintainability, and adaptability for other GUIs.</p>
