    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion of whether to merge autotools or CMake for the future build system of Bitcoin happened when a patch for autotools was submitted. However, the autotools system needs to be redone before it can be merged. Autotools is more standard than CMake and does not require additional installations as it is a shell script. On the other hand, CMake generates native build scripts for various platforms like Make, XCode, and Visual Studio, has a clearer syntax, is faster, and is supported natively in Qt Creator in the QT SDK. A CMake build system for Bitcoin is already available in rpcminer. Pieter Wuille, who has no preference for any particular project build system, suggested that the chosen system should be easy to set up, allows building of the Bitcoin codebase on several Linux distros, supports cross-compilation to Windows, supports OSX, is easy to maintain, and is adaptable to other GUIs. He also asked for other opinions and interested parties who would write a CMake configuration for Bitcoin.</p>
