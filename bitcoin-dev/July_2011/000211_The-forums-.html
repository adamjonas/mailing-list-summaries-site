    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Douglas Huff and Matt Corallo, Corallo stated that people don't necessarily dislike having forums, but Huff disagreed, calling them a "cesspool." However, Huff did express interest in having a dedicated help forum for the client software and protocol with a link to the FAQ included. He also noted that forums make it easier to discuss graphical subjects such as UI. Huff acknowledged that maintaining a normal forum might be difficult given the type of people that Bitcoin attracts, but suggested that problematic users could be sent to the bitcointalk forums. The current forums will be moved to another domain due to their growth into a monstrosity.</p>
