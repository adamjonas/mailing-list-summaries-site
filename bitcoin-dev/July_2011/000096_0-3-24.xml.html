    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen discusses the default settings of UPnP in Bitcoin with other contributors. The poll shows that 55% of users have UPnP off by default, while 25% have it on by default in the GUI and off in bitcoind. One user suggests turning it on by default in the GUI and leaving it off in bitcoind. Another user expresses their dislike for UPnP and how it exemplifies the issue of convenience over security in computer security. However, they also recognize that UPnP is currently the standard mechanism for letting a computer behind a NAT accept incoming connections and that enabling UPnP for Bitcoin is logical since it is a P2P application that requires receiving messages from other peers. In addition, a suggestion is made to use IPv6 instead of UPnP, but it may not be as stable or widely supported.</p>
