    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2011, Chris expressed his views on certain features that could be added to Bitcoin. He believed that multithreading the RPC and adding Keep-Alive would benefit everyone and had no downside. However, he was against including long polling support as it would only benefit pool providers and not the majority of users. In addition, Chris thought that the Hub mode was good and suggested optimizing the connection logic for all nodes by default. Jeff Garzik posted a link to a document that included several useful features, such as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support, which had been requested by big pools. The discussion also included an advertisement for Splunk, a service that makes sense of data generated in IT infrastructures.</p>
