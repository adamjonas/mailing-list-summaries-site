    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent by Gavin Andresen in 2011, he expressed his concern about contributors being hesitant to ask for help on the last 10% of a tricky bug they have been working on because they fear someone might swoop in and steal their bounty. To address this, Joel suggested that publishing the work done up to that point could guarantee that no one else can claim they fixed it all by themselves. However, there could be quarrels about how much of the bounty to give and to whom.</p>
