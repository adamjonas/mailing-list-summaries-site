    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, the issue of implementing a full escrow feature set on Bitcoin's client was discussed. The focus on maturity/bugfixes may delay the patch, but the IsStandard part is uncontroversial and could be added quickly. Pull 349 implements a multiple signature escrowed transaction, which would be useful to have sooner rather than later, especially since clearcoin has gone. However, one issue with multisig validation was exposed by the patch: due to redundancy in the script length coding opcodes, it's possible to code a script multiple ways. This causes the signature validation to fail when something used OP_PUSHDATA when a direct length could have been used. One candidate fix for this is excluding the length opcodes from the comparison, but it carries a risk of creating differences in how nodes validate transactions leading to lasting forks. Another way of fixing it would be to define that OP_PUSHDATA* cannot be used to push the smaller lengths which could be more efficiently encoded with the direct length opcodes.</p>
