    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about calculating balances of arbitrary addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain, Mike Hearn explains that every incoming transaction has to be examined because there is no way for a client to know in advance whether any broadcast transaction contains a send to an address in its wallet. Furthermore, he explains that there is no way to know if transactions for an address in your wallet were contained in blocks missed while offline. He also expresses interest in supporting a split wallet feature where the private key is held elsewhere but the current balance in a particular address can still be reported. When discussing verifying the merkle tree, Mike notes that it is more efficient to verify the merkle branch, but efficiency is not as important when only verifying one or minimal numbers of blocks. When asked about using a filter to reduce the list of transactions needed after being offline, Mike expresses confusion and asks if the filter would be by address. Finally, when discussing new commands, Mike states that he wants his client to be 100% compatible with the official client and would only introduce new commands if they were introduced in the official client first.</p>
