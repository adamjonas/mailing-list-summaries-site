    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin v0.3.24 release candidate #1 has been made available for download at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/test/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/test/</a>. This is a bug fix release, with wallet encryption being ready for testing at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/352">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/352</a>. The release includes fixes to block downloads that were failing or taking unreasonable amounts of time to complete due to the increased size of the block chain bumping up against some earlier buffer-size DoS limits. Additionally, a fix was made for the crash caused by loss/lack of network connection. Notable changes in v0.3.24 include DNS seeding enabled by default and UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client. Bitcoin sorely needs automated tests, and this version sees the inclusion of an initial unit testing framework. The internal wallet code cleanup is another change that provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption. It should be noted that bitcoind and unofficial builds remain unchanged, but the use of "-upnp" is encouraged to help the network. The full changelog ("git shortlog v0.3.23..") lists the contributors and their specific contributions. It also includes the PGP signatures and hashes for the various files included in the release.</p>
