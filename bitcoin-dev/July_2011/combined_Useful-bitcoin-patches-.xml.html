    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers have been discussing several potential new features for the platform, including multithreading the RPC and adding keep-alive support for HTTP/1.1. However, there is some disagreement over whether to include long polling support, as it would only benefit a small number of people. Additionally, some developers are concerned about the impact on network usage if 'hub mode' were implemented. While Luke Dash Jr.'s getwork_dedupe branch has been running stably, developers are cautious about adding too many new features until the codebase is thoroughly cleaned and tested.It's important to note that Bitcoin fees are not intended to support miners, but rather to prevent users from wasting resources with DDoS attacks. Some features, such as txinfo and bitcoinuri, may be considered "useless feature creep" without any real-world use cases. Multithreading the RPC and implementing Keep-Alive could speed up certain services, but extensive testing will be necessary to avoid race conditions. Regarding 'hub mode,' developers believe it would consume more resources than it adds and suggest that miners concerned about fast block propagation should manually add nodes. Improvements to the connection and forwarding logic are needed. Lowering fees may increase awareness of other clients that do not try to control users, but a carefully thought-out solution is necessary to prevent random transactions. Developers should not interfere between users and pools willing to conduct business. All of these discussions can be found on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
