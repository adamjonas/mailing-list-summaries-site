    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing various features and fixes that could be added to Bitcoin. Multithreading the RPC and adding keep-alive support are two features that have been met with approval, as they would be beneficial for the network. However, some features such as long polling support and hub mode have been met with skepticism due to low demand and potential harm to the network.There are also proposed fixes for resource leaks and getwork deduplication which have already been suggested and are expected to be implemented soon. On the other hand, other proposed features like coinbaser and minfee modes have not been well received as they only benefit a small minority of users. Additionally, some developers worry about the potential for DDoS attacks if lower fees are accepted.An email conversation between Christian Decker and Matt Corallo revolves around the topic of adding features to Bitcoin software. Decker sees multithreading the RPC and Keep-Alive as beneficial while Corallo points out that multithreading will expose race conditions and requires rigorous testing before implementation. Hub mode, which aggressively connects nodes, is not favored by Corallo as it consumes resources and increases the risk of DDoS attacks. Instead, miners should manually add nodes to improve block propagation.Luke-Jr joins in the conversation to argue that users want to pay lower fees but developers are getting in the way by writing software that interferes with transactions. However, the fees are there to prevent unnecessary resource wastage and DDoS attacks. Links are provided for URI support and git access to the software. The email ends with a signature.asc attachment.</p>
