    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers are split between early adopters, ambitious people working on alt clients, and hobby developers donating code to alt chain clients. The problem is that it’s hard for new developers to justify volunteering work on a codebase which will directly benefit other people even if they do nothing. To bring these people together, there needs to be some kind of sponsorship of developers. Bounties may go wrong but grants for active developers make more sense and someone needs to decide who is active enough. The “people are making money off of my back” feeling stands in the way of new developers so separating Bitcoin the program from Bitcoin the blockchain and accepting patches for merged mining and alt chain stuff which doesn't directly benefit Bitcoin would help decrease this feeling. Linux kernel has not solved the problem of developers simply wanting to work on interesting stuff rather than debug. Companies pay for support and bug fixes including those made by developers who drop and run without addressing feedback regarding their contribution.</p>
