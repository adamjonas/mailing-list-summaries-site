    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread consists of updates on several versions of Bitcoin. An IRC post with the link to the "bitcoin-3diff.txt" version was made that included several useful features like HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support which pools had been requesting for. Luke-Jr posted a new version of "bitcoin-4diff.txt" but hadn't compared it yet. He had extracted proper git branches for each logical part for the "3diff" version like hub_mode, threaded_rpc and signal_blk_notify. He suggested that some form of patch implementing these should be pulled soon, maybe 0.4.1 or sooner. However, he advised against adding features for small minorities until the codebase is cleaned and efficient. Luke-Jr also considered some other branches valid candidates for merging like coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, eligius_sendfee, txinfo, and bitcoinuri. While URI support would be nice, he believed that some of these features were useless feature creep. He provided the links to all these branches in his gitorious repository. The email ends with an unrelated advertisement for Splunk, a software company that makes sense of IT infrastructure data.</p>
