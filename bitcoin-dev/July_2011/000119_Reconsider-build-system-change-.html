    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between two developers, Douglas Huff criticizes Cmake and compares it to autotools. He argues that both are equally bad and that there is no advantage to using Cmake over autotools. However, the other developer disagrees and defends Cmake, stating that it is simpler and more elegant compared to the "monster" that is autotools. They also argue that Cmake can generate native build scripts for other platforms, while autotools can only generate makefiles. The discussion then turns to the issue of dependencies and familiarity with the systems. While Cmake requires a specific dependency that may not be installed by default, the other developer points out that it is used by projects such as LLVM, Blender, and OpenCV. They also mention a tool called "ccmake" which offers an interactive interface for configuration and is even better than the "configure --help" command.</p>
