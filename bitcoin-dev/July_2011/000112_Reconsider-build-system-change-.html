    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on July 2, 2011, John Smith questioned why they chose autotools as the future build system instead of cmake. He listed several reasons why CMake would be a better option, such as generating native build scripts for Make, XCode, and Visual Studio, having a clearer syntax, and being faster. Additionally, CMake is natively supported in Qt Creator in the QT SDK and used by many other open-source applications. Smith provided a link to a CMake build system for bitcoin that was already integrated into rpcminer. It is worth noting that CMake also supports cross-compiling.</p>
