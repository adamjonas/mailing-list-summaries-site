    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 30, 2011, Jeff Garzik shared a post on IRC which included several useful features such as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support that big pools had been asking for. However, he suggested that "Native Long Polling Support" should be renamed since true native long polling would only be applicable for solo miners. He also mentioned having a branch with a fix from Luke Dash Jr., although he did not verify if the version was up to date. Additionally, Jeff mentioned that "RPC Turbocharge" would break JSON-RPC over SSL if it only incorporated his changes for multithreading.</p>
