        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author is seeking to be able to associate metadata with transactions and address book records for UI purposes. This would be completely client-side and not visible on the blockchain. For transactions, the author proposes a std::string description field that users can give to transactions, such as "ordered eggs." For addresses, the author suggests a bool visibleInInterface field that hides old addresses/labels from lists without removing them for lookup purposes. The author believes an extensible system would be beneficial as more metadata could be useful in the future, such as accounting categories and links to third-party services. The author seeks input on where to implement this system while minimizing core changes. They are aware that this could be implemented entirely within the UI code but are unsure if this is ideal as it would require database handling and more data files for users to backup and track.</p>
