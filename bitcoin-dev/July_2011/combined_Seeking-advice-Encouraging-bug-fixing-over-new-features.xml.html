        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gavin Andresen expressed his skepticism regarding the effectiveness of awarding bitcoins for fixing a bug as it would not encourage long-term contributors. He did, however, acknowledge that it could motivate some people to fix a bug or two. Gavin also supported the idea of branching for releases and creating a roadmap. He mentioned that he arranged to get paid to work on bitcoin full-time. Rick Wesson recommended putting a bounty on the person to lead the effort rather than on bugs. However, Gavin was already leading the effort and getting paid for it. Lastly, Rick suggested putting a bounty on improving the testing framework of the software.</p>
