    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about different git branches on July 10, 2011, Luke-Jr suggested several branches that he thinks should be merged. Matt Corallo did not agree with merging some of those branches because they could harm the network. He disagreed with the hub_mode branch and stated that it provides little to no advantage for miners while potentially harming the network. Similarly, he also disagreed with the eligius_relay and eligius_sendfee branches, stating that lower fees would not prevent DDoS attacks and that the fees are there to prevent users from wasting resources.Matt Corallo did find some of the branches suggested by Luke-Jr useful, including coinbaser and minfee_modes. However, he also suggested that something more generalized is needed to allow for more fee control by the users while still preventing users from sending transactions that lock their coins in limbo. He suggested that this direction could be achieved by providing the mode as an input and moving GetMinFee to QtScript since the 0.4 version was moving to Qt. Furthermore, Luke-Jr defended his suggestions, stating that other clients could gain awareness if users feel forced to pay more than necessary. He suspected that others have not changed their coinbase output to a random set because they haven't figured out how. While Matt Corallo did not agree with all of Luke-Jr's suggestions, he acknowledged that some of them could be useful.</p>
