    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the need for a 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The proposed changes include sipa's flood limit fix, DNS seed on by default, and maybe UPnP enabled by default as well. Gregory Maxwell thinks that fixing the flood disconnects is important because slow bringups are problematic. He believes that the flood disconnects have been contributing to network partitioning and adding to the partitioning problems caused elsewhere. The current checkpoint also needs to be updated because the difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. A rather large number of parties could mine forks at 1/16th the current difficulty for nodes that they've sibyled. Douglas Huff agrees that it's about time for another checkpoint.</p>
