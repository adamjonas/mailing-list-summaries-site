    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between John Smith and Joel Joonatan Kaartinen on July 27, 2011, Joel suggested adding a way for anyone to contribute to the bounty attached to a bug on the bug tracker. He also proposed a listing page for bugs with their bounties. John agreed that it was a good idea, but he wasn't sure if the Github bug tracker supported extension attributes. He suggested that people could use comments to let others know that they are already working on a feature to avoid double work. However, John expressed his concerns about whether small bounties would be enough to justify agreeing to Github's steep demand for potentially unlimited money in their terms of service.</p>
