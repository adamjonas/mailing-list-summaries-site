    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>John Smith proposed to add notifications to the Bitcoin client and wallet using the boost::signal mechanism for decoupled delivery of signals from an object. The system would allow multiple other objects to listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. Specific notifications that would be useful for Wallet include balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification, and askFee. For Network client, the specific notifications would include numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification. Matt and Pieter had a similar idea of a source cleanup, which would allow for clean separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites of any part without touching anything but the parts being redone, and cool programs like pushpoold/a block notification server/etc to use Bitcoin as a library fairly efficiently. They were considering implementing a similar system for internal communication between net/wallet/blockdb/mempool.</p>
