    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Jeff Garzik expresses some concerns regarding the release of Bitcoin version 0.3.24. Specifically, he is unsure whether the release should be a cherry-picked branch or current upstream with some specific fixes not yet in git. He notes that cherry-picked branches have some disadvantages, such as throwing away the testing people have done on upstream git and creating a dead-end branch that may not be relevant to future versions. However, he acknowledges that release management rules are more like guidelines than actual rules. Matt responds by stating that he has little preference on the matter, but believes it would be good to do a broad-base test of CWallet in 0.3.24 to find potential bugs before crypto and 0.4. He also suggests that they shouldn't spend too much time on this minor update release and instead focus on 0.4 without interruption.Overall, the email exchange discusses the pros and cons of different release strategies for Bitcoin version 0.3.24 and highlights the importance of testing for potential bugs.</p>
