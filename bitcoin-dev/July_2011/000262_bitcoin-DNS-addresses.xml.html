    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is offering patches to improve DNS lookup for the IRC server. However, the clipboard feature is not a UI element in flow design and is susceptible to MITM attacks for the most popular OSes. The author suggests thinking beyond personal connections and creating successful apps and protocols that make tasks such as buying coffee at Starbucks easier. Another user suggests a standardized HTTPS-based protocol in which a Bitcoin URI could contain a domain name, and then the client would challenge the domain to sign a nonce with the key corresponding to the address. This feature would silently enhance the UI without demanding any action from users. The "copy Bitcoin address" button in the UI can provide the clipboard with both text/plain and text/html content so the right one is picked depending on context.</p>
