    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Offel expressed his concern about the lack of documentation and poor use of threads in Bitcoin's codebase, suggesting that every class should be able to stand on its own for reuse. However, some members disagreed, stating that "talk is cheap without any coding." They argued that new, clean, secondary implementations of critical logic, good automatic testing shims, and specific locks for objects with general code cleanup and modularization are needed.The code quality of Bitcoin needs improvement as it is prone to bugs. Suggestions include removing all threads and critical sections and building a sequential easy-to-follow model. It is suggested that one file per class, no methods, and single code line longer than a screen page is natural to write code. There are many issues with Bitcoin, such as long build times, lack of module isolation and implementations in header files.The official Bitcoin client should be extra clean and well documented. A central hub infrastructure to Bitcoin is being worked on to subscribe to get notified of new blocks/txes/etc, push new blocks/txes/etc, and can get information about blocks/txes/etc. The use of Db4 in a mailing list archive is debated for indexed database functionality without SQL interface and its performance overhead when storing small information. Fixes to bugs in an old codebase while rewriting a new one is worthless and creates more effort than necessary. The point is to have quick extendibility and therefore more feature-rich secure code, improving trust and resulting in better external Bitcoin-related projects.While there are no real reasons to move all chain-related settings to a chain description file, having all adjustable parameters in one place would allow the possibility to quickly build an internal testnet without crazy firewalling to prevent it from dying, detect problematic DDoS protection settings early, and give the average user the possibility to adjust all important settings if they know what they're doing. Transaction (relay) fees are essential for transaction fee handling to serve their purpose and need a recoding.The Bitcoin code base is not as messy as it appears due to its lack of clear lines between classes. Its general algorithms are quite good, though the net could probably benefit from a ground-up rewrite of the backend. The use of boost is arguable, mainly used for threading and FOREACH. There is a style guide, but readability is not included. There are tons of hardcoded values for the official and testnet blockchain. Alternate chains should be designed in such a way as to share the main chain's difficulty as described by Mike on the forum, not just make a new chain and hope it sticks. It is suggested to begin a complete rewrite inspired by the old code rather than moving a lot of "known to be somehow functional" around.</p>
