    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that using accounts for receiving funds on merchant sites is not the safest way to do so due to numerous bugs and problems associated with it. Instead, a recommended and safer method involves using listreceivedsince which is called by a cron job and its output is parsed and placed into another table where another job creates a deposit request from that table. Although polling listtransactions may be less convenient, it can also be used to receive funds. Gavin Andresen also added that fixing listtransaction's output would not be a priority for most web services operators, but fixing getbalance and listtransactions performance problems as well as push-notification of coins received to accounts are higher priority items on their list.</p>
