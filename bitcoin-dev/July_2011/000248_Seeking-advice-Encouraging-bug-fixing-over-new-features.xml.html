    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Developers working on Linux kernel often prioritize interesting tasks over debugging. However, to ensure stability, certain periods of time are designated for bug-fixing only, and new feature pushes are refused during these times. Critical bugs are addressed before the release of the kernel. The ecosystem around Linux has grown to include support networks for companies who pay for support, which includes bug fixes. Support organizations like Red Hat perform a lot of grunt work fixing issues because they have direct contact with users in the field encountering problems. "Drop and run" coding is a term used for developers who add a new feature and then disappear without addressing bug reports or other feedback regarding their contribution.</p>
