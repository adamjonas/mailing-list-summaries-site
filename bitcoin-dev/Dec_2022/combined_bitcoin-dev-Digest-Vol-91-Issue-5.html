        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard has proposed the removal of the "mempoolfullrbf" feature from Bitcoin Core, citing potential impacts on various use-cases such as on-chain payments, Lightning, and coinjoins. He acknowledges that this decision should follow the same process as any code change, considering factors such as ecosystem impact and utility. While he recognizes the potential benefits for wallets and multi-party applications/contracting protocols, Antoine also sees a lowering of the technical bar for double-spends.A mempool policy design philosophy was suggested to accommodate all Bitcoin use-cases without harming network interests, but concerns remain about miner incentives and potential asymmetries in mining incomes. Antoine believes that removing the "risk-induction" feature is better for the ecosystem, as it alters security expectations for 0conf operators. He suggests that more effective usage data from merchants/service operators would be valuable.The deployment of fullrbf could increase the risk exposure for users of GAP600, a zero-conf risk analysis business integrated with payment processors/liquidity providers and merchants. This increased risk exposure may affect the acceptance of incoming zero-conf transactions. Antoine requests clarification on transaction statistics, such as the number of Bitcoin-only transactions, those excluded from zeroconf, and the average feerate.Antoine maintains his personal position on fullrbf and notes that there is no conceptual consensus within the community on deploying or removing it. He emphasizes the need to address economic flows at risk and potential loss in miners' income before removing the option from Bitcoin Core. Additionally, he questions whether user choice in policy settings should be restrained to preserve mining income and established use-case stability.The original technical motivation for the mempoolfullrbf option was to address a denial-of-service (DoS) vector affecting multi-party transactions like coinjoin and contracting protocols such as Lightning. However, alternative solutions with their own trade-offs and conceptual issues have since been devised. John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym.to, supports zero-conf support for Lightning Network adoption, as it reduces friction and allows for instant, seamless user experiences within wallets.</p>
