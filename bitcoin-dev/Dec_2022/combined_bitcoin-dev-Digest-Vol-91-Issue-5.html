        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion about Bitcoin's mempool policy design philosophy, the question was raised about whether it would generate asymmetries in mining incomes. Antoine suggests that removing the "risk-induction" feature of `mempoolfullrbf` would be better for the ecosystem. He also notes that anyone can create and distribute patches for any given mempool policy but argues that `mempoolfullrbf` removes the user choice of zero-conf services and positions Core as a political authority and influencer.GAP600, a zero-conf risk analysis business, is concerned that the deployment of fullrbf by enough full-node operators and a subset of the mining hashrate would lower the cost of double-spend attack by lambda users, therefore increasing the risk exposure of GAP600's users. This could lead to an alteration in the acceptance of incoming zero-conf transactions.Antoine has asked for clarification on how many transactions are Bitcoin-only, how many are excluded from zeroconf due to factors like RBF, long-chain of unconfirmed ancestors or too high-value, and what the average feerate is. As a community, there is no conceptual consensus on deploying full-rbf nor removing it.To remove the current option from Bitcoin Core, Antoine believes there must be enough economic flows at risk and a sizable loss in miners income. Furthermore, there is still the open question of whether the Bitcoin protocol development community should restrain user choice in policy settings in the name of preserving mining income and established use-case stability.The original technical motivation of `mempoolfullrbf` was to address a DoS vector affecting multi-party transactions like coinjoin and contracting protocols like Lightning. Since then, alternative paths to solve this DoS vector have been devised, all with their own trade-offs and conceptual issues. John Carvalho, CEO of Synonym.to, believes that zero-conf support reduces friction for LN adoption by allowing us to make instant, seamless UX within wallets when onboarding, rebalancing, and splicing.</p>
