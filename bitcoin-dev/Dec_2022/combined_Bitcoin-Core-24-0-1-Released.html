        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released version 24.0.1 of its software, which brings new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are advised to shut down older versions before upgrading. The compatibility of Bitcoin Core is supported on Linux kernel-based operating systems, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.One notable addition in version 24.0.1 is the `mempoolfullrbf` configuration, allowing users to replace older unconfirmed transactions with newer ones using a feature called full-RBF. However, contributors strongly recommend that merchants and services not treat unconfirmed transactions as final unless they have appropriate recourse or plans when assumptions fail.The update also includes reworked logic for downloading headers from peers, which may increase the initial sync time for new nodes starting up for the first time. Version 23.1 addresses this by improving the presync phase to avoid redundant header downloads. Some RPC configuration options have been removed, while new RPCs like `sendall`, `gettxspendingprevout`, and `simulaterawtransaction` have been added.Version 24.0.1 introduces several low-level changes, including updates to RPC commands and Miniscript descriptor options for certain commands. GUI changes include a new menu item for restoring a wallet from a backup file and saving configuration changes to a `/settings.json` file instead of the Qt settings backend. The interaction between GUI settings and `bitcoin.conf` settings has been simplified.Additionally, the release credits acknowledge the contributions of those who directly impacted this version of Bitcoin Core, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.On December 13, 2022, Michael Ford announced the availability of Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 for download from the official website. It was mentioned that version 24.0 had been tagged but not fully released due to last-minute issues. However, the PGP signature on the email was found to be invalid. The announcement on the bitcoin-core-dev mailing list also had an invalid signature, likely due to a formatting error caused by sending the message as both text and HTML. Peter Todd reminded users not to send HTML emails to the mailing list.In conclusion, Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 brings various improvements and additions, including the full-RBF feature, enhanced headers sync logic, updated RPCs, GUI changes, and low-level modifications. Users are recommended to upgrade their older versions, and credits are given to contributors and translators.</p>
