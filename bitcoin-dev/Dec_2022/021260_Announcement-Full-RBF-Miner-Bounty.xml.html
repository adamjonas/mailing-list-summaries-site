    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has set up a mempoolfullrbf=1 node to monitor replacement events and is logging them. He filters the full-RBF replacements and lists the replaced and replacement transactions in his post. He mentioned that he did not take any special steps for peering with other full-rbf nodes but suspects he was lucky to have a full-RBF peer or more than one from the start. The node accepts incoming connections on a non-default port and currently has 45 inbound slots filled up. Over the last few days, he mostly saw OP_RETURN transactions which were mostly OpenTimestamps transactions. Five full-RBF replacements have been mined in two blocks since his last post. Peter listed these replacements in his post and stated that it seems like Luxor might have mempoolfullrbf=1 enabled.</p>
