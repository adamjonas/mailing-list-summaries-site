        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A member of the Bitcoin developer community has set up a node to monitor replacement events, logging full-RBF replacements and listing replaced and replacement transactions on their website. Additional information was requested to be added to the list, including how long ago the replaced transaction was seen compared to the full RBF event timestamp and how long after the full RBF event the block was received.Peter Todd raised funds for an effort to stop the propagation of full-RBF replaced blocks, with a reward of around 0.02 BTC or $400 USD at current prices. The effort seems to have been mostly claimed at 0.014btc/$235, 9238sat/vb. However, Todd claims to have double-spent a transaction on the bitcoin network using his OpenTimestamps project and turned down the full-rbf reward to more normal fee levels.Murch, another bitcoin developer, tweeted about the default mempool filling up, and Todd believes this contributed to his double-spending issue. There is a risk of the mempool filling up again, which makes it easy to double-spend with the obvious low-fee/high-fee method as the min relay fee keeps shifting.Todd provided a timeline of events regarding the mempool and the double-spending incident. He also noted that the transactions were mined by Foundry and that this seems to be evidence that there is currently no significant hashrate mining with fullrbf policies. Todd has been running OTS calendars with full-rbf replacements for a few months without clear evidence of a full-rbf replacement. The bitcoin-dev mailing list was used to discuss the incident. One option against Peter Todd's attack on opt-in RBF and 0Conf bitcoin usage is to work on a Bitcoin Core implementation that stops propagation of full-RBF replaced blocks. In a Twitter thread, it was revealed that the block claimed in included two Alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org transactions in addition to Peter Todd's reward.</p>
