    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Daniel Lipshitz suggested the use of first-seen-safe replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF) as an alternative to full replace-by-fee (FullRBF) in order to retain the significant 0-conf use case while balancing the risks associated with it. John Carvalho expressed concern over the side-effects of FullRBF, including increased double-spending at unknowing merchants, and stated that discussion of the FSS-RBF feature was worth considering. In response to a question about the difference between FSS-RBF and FullRBF, Lipshitz explained that the only technical difference is the addition of an input transaction in FullRBF, and that FSS-RBF would be easily resolved by monitoring block inclusion for the relevant output and adding some wallet logic. Yuval Kogman provided a link to a previous discussion on FSS-RBF led by Peter Todd.</p>
