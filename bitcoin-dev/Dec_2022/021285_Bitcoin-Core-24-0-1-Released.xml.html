    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core has released version 24.0.1 of its software, which includes new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. Users running an older version are advised to shut it down before upgrading. The compatibility of Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.One significant addition in this version is the `mempoolfullrbf` configuration, which allows users to replace any of their older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called *full-RBF*. However, contributors strongly recommend that merchants and services not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so, take appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan when their assumptions do not hold.The update also includes reworked logic to download headers from peers, which may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for the first time. In another update, version 23.1 has improved presync phase to avoid downloading headers twice. Several RPC configuration options have been removed, and new RPCs have been added, including `sendall`, `gettxspendingprevout`, and `simulaterawtransaction`.Version 24.0.1 also includes several low-level changes, such as an update to RPC commands and Miniscript descriptor options for certain commands. GUI changes have also been made, such as a new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file and saving configuration changes to a `/settings.json` file rather than the Qt settings backend. Additionally, the interaction between GUI settings and `bitcoin.conf` settings has been simplified.Lastly, credits were given to all those who contributed directly to the release, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.</p>
