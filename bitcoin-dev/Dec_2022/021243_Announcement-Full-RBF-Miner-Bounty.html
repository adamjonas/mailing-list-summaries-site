    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 5, 2022, El_Hoy suggested a solution to the attack on opt-in RBF and 0Conf bitcoin usage by Peter Todd. The solution involved working on a bitcoin core implementation that stops propagation of full-rbf replaced blocks. By running multiple nodes with such functionality, miners who enable full-rbf would be at risk, thereby incentivizing against it. However, this would require adding an option on bitcoin core, which is politically difficult to implement given that Peter Todd already has commit access to the main repository. Eloy suggests that a sufficiently incentivized actor like Daniel Lipshitz or Muun wallet developers could work on a fork and run several nodes with such functionality. With 10 to 20 nodes running such a rule, there would be a significant risk for full-rbf miners in the percolation model. On November 15, 2022, Peter Todd had previously claimed a bounty for a successful attack on opt-in RBF and 0Conf bitcoin usage. He then got more than enough donations to give another run at it.Peter Todd had double-spent the txin of the high fee tx that got mined, which was easy to do due to the low-fee/high-fee method as the min relay fee keeps shifting. There was also another full-rbf double-spend from the Bob calendar, along the same lines. The first few blocks did not keep the earlier 1.2sat/vb txs. It was concluded that currently, there is no significant hashrate mining with fullrbf policies despite the bounty having been collected.</p>
