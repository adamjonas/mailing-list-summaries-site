    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alicexbt, a user on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, has provided a detailed summary of the process for adding new maintainers to the Bitcoin Core team. The post outlines the recent addition of glowzow as a maintainer, as well as current efforts to add vasild as a new maintainer. Alicexbt proposes several changes to the current process, including opening a "Call for maintainers" issue when a new maintainer is needed, discussing nominated contributors in an IRC meeting where everyone can share their opinion, and avoiding self-merging pull requests.In response to Alicexbt's post, Michael Folkson suggests that there is some confusion around the process for adding new maintainers and pledges to look into the matter offline. He advises against "ranting and raving or throwing toys out the pram" on the mailing list and wishes everyone happy holidays.The post includes links to various pull requests, IRC meetings, and issues related to the process for adding maintainers. These links provide additional context and support for Alicexbt's proposals.</p>
