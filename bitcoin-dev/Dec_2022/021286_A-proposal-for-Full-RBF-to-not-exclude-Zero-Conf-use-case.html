    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message thread, Bitcoin developer Peter Todd explains why his first-seen-safe proposal is incompatible with multi-party transactions such as coinjoins and multi-party lightning channels. He mentions that full-rbf behavior without restriction on outputs is necessary for these use-cases. He suggests the spent-nVersion signaling proposal by Antoine Riard as a compromise option which has privacy impacts and increases costs and time in many cases. Todd advises centralized payment providers to change their business model to scalable instant payment tech like Lightning or expand their business with other chains such as BSV. He also mentions that some hashing power is already beginning to run with full-rbf, and he expects that percentage to increase over time. The email includes links to related topics like spent-nVersion signaling proposal, negative privacy impact of the proposal, support of BSV, and hashing power running with full-rbf.</p>
