        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released several versions of its software with various updates and improvements. Version 24.0.1 includes a new option for transaction replacement policies, allowing users to change their node's policy for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions. The release also removes the `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option and updates the RPC `getblockchaininfo`. Version 22.0 includes updates to several areas, including the RPCs, REST APIs, build system, wallet, GUI, and low-level changes. It also adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` option for enabling the mempool to accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability signaling.The latest release of Bitcoin Core includes changes to the protocol that affect transaction acceptance policies. The "first-seen" policy, which assumes that the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a node will be the one that gets confirmed, is not guaranteed by the Bitcoin Protocol. Despite this lack of assurance, many merchants and services still make this assumption. However, there are several benefits to removing this simplification, including the ability for senders to replace unconfirmed transactions with higher-fee alternatives. Version 0.21.1 of the software is a minor release that incorporates support for the MemPool full replace-by-fee (RBF) feature introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 and is reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added to enable the mempool to accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability signaling. The latest release also includes updates to RPCs, such as the removal of certain configuration options and fields previously deprecated in version 23.0. Notable changes to wallet-related RPCs include the addition of the `sendall` RPC, which spends specific UTXOs without creating change, and the `gettxspendingprevout` RPC, which scans the mempool for transactions spending given outpoints. Additionally, the `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use a query parameter instead of a path parameter to specify the result count.Lastly, configuration changes made in the Bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting, proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to `/settings.json` file rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or Unix desktop config files). The release also includes low-level changes like the `deriveaddresses`, `getdescriptorinfo`, `importdescriptors` and `scantxoutset` commands now accepting Miniscript expression within a `wsh()` descriptor. The `getaddressinfo`, `decodescript`, `listdescriptors` and `listunspent` commands may now output a Miniscript descriptor inside a `wsh()` where a `wsh(raw())` descriptor was previously returned.</p>
