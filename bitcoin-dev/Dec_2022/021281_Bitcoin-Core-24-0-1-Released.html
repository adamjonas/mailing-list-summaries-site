    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core has released version 24.0.1, which includes new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users running an older version are recommended to shut it down before installing the latest version. The compatibility of Bitcoin Core has been tested on various operating systems. A new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration option is available that allows users to change the policy their individual node will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions. P2P and network changes have been made to address a potential denial-of-service, which improves the logic to download headers from peers.Version 23.1 of Bitcoin Core includes various updates and new features. The P2P networking code has been improved to support more efficient headers-first syncing, which verifies the work for a chain before storing the headers permanently. The updated RPCs include the removal of the `-deprecatedrpc=softforks`, `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, and `-deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration options. The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures.The latest release of Bitcoin Core includes several changes and improvements, including a new `parent_descs` field for every "receive" entry in the `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions`, and `gettransaction` outputs. An optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command. GUI changes include a new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file and configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI are now saved to `/settings.json` file rather than to the Qt settings backend.In terms of low-level changes, the `deriveaddresses`, `getdescriptorinfo`, `importdescriptors`, and `scantxoutset` commands now accept Miniscript expression within a `wsh()` descriptor. The `getaddressinfo`, `decodescript`, `listdescriptors`, and `listunspent` commands may now output a Miniscript descriptor inside a `wsh()` where a `wsh(raw())` descriptor was previously returned.Finally, the release credits go to the numerous contributors who directly impacted this version of Bitcoin Core.</p>
