        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent Bitcoin-dev thread, Peter Todd expressed his concern about the lack of easily accessible sources for onion addresses to try. However, Vasil Dimov pointed out that the issue is more complex than it seems at first glance. Dimov highlighted the fact that obtaining onion addresses is inexpensive and trying them without considering their longer-term track record can lead to problems. There is a risk of inadvertently obtaining the addresses associated with a one-time Sybil attack.To address this challenge, Dimov proposed an alternative solution â€“ using DNS seed records instead. These addresses have been tested over extended periods, offering a higher probability of representing genuine nodes. However, Dimov mentioned that his DNS seed is not currently configured to track nodes using Tor, which limits its effectiveness in this context.On December 22, 2022, Peter Todd shared his concerns on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the limited availability of convenient sources for onion addresses. In response to Todd's post, Vasil Dimov offered a potential solution in the form of a command that can be executed in the terminal. The command, "bitcoin-cli getnodeaddresses 0 |jq -r 'map(select(.network == "onion")) | . [].address'", could help obtain onion addresses for testing purposes.Dimov concluded his email by including a quote emphasizing the importance of living life to the fullest.</p>
