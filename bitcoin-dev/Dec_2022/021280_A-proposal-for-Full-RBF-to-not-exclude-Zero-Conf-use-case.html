    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Daniel Lipshitz of GAP600 suggested that First-seen-safe replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF) might be a suitable option for balancing FullRBF while retaining the significant 0-conf use case. Lipshitz was responding to a query from John Carvalho about why FSS-RBF wasn't put in place earlier and whether there were problems with the design. Carvalho expressed concern about the unhealthy side-effects of Full-RBF, such as more double-spending at unknowing merchants after years of FSS protection. Lipshitz acknowledged not being aware of FSS-RBF's existence and found no technical issues with its implementation. He pointed out that the reasons against adopting Full-RBF listed on the Bitcoin Core website do not apply in this case since OptinRBF already exists as an option and FSS-RBF offers added benefits.</p>
