    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev community has set up a mempoolfullrbf=1 node and is logging replacement events in order to monitor them more closely. They are filtering full-RBF replacements and listing the replaced and replacement transactions on <a href="https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/.">https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/.</a> Another member of the community suggests that it would be helpful to list how long ago the replaced transaction was seen compared to the full RBF event timestamp, particularly for cases where the replaced tx was the one that was mined and how long after the full RBF event the block was received. The suggestion is made to group all related replacements together so that they can be viewed as a single block with timestamps. The member also suggests that this information might be interesting to see in general for bip-125 opt-in rbf txs as well because it could show how common the "offer a low fee, and raise it over time" approach is in practice.</p>
