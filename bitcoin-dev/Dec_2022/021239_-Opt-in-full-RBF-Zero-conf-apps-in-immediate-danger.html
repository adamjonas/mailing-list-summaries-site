    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Daniel Lipshitz, CEO of GAP600, and Peter Todd reveals that some of their statistics seem off due to clients querying each trx hash with a separate output address. This means that the value of their total processed is possibly a more reflective indicator. In November 2022, there were 900k unique trx hashes queried, with 1.5m trxs on their count since trx hashes are queried with different output addresses. The actual value was USD 220M benefiting from zero conf acceptance. Max Krupyshev, CEO of Coinspaid, sent an email to Daniel confirming that they run quite a big Bitcoin payment operation with over 300k incoming transactions, with 700+ inputs a month. They enjoy zero conf flows that GAP600 offers. Their two main production clusters are rotating around: 3JodN7GmkHdPgKj9G7HCkn9NDLhrcWCjVN and 3QKCocNhzAgtgFLsD5qUZcG6e4TkfRf421.Daniel claimed that as of the end of November 2022, GAP600 has processed circa 15M transactions with a cumulative value of 2.3B USD value. However, Peter Todd questions these figures since it is not clear how many transactions rely on their unconfirmed transaction tools. Todd also brings up CoinsPaid's stringent KYC procedures and risk-based approach to CDD that verify user identities to mitigate fraud, money laundering, and other activities linked to criminality and terrorism. Coindirect requires confirmations before using coins deposited in their wallet, while Coinify's API docs give no indication of risk scoring or any other GAP600 integration.</p>
