    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the Bitcoin contracting primitives working group, has proposed a meeting for Tuesday, December 20th at 18:00 UTC. The first part of the meeting will involve discussing all the contracting protocol use-cases and corresponding primitives to ensure that the R&D effort is exhaustive with known ideas issued by the community in recent years. If anyone has been working on a primitive that is missing from the current listing, they are encouraged to open a PR or contact Antoine. The second part of the meeting will listen to everyone's blockers in their contracting primitives/covenant research and offer more review on proposals if necessary. Communication will take place on #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and logs from the previous session are available. Antoine's personal goal is to keep rolling the ball on a taproot annex implementation as it could be useful as a fee-bumping primitive/constrained amount malleability extension for multi-party channels and other uses.</p>
