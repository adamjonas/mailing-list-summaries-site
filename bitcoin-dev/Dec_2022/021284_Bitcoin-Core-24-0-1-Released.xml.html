    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 13, 2022, Michael Ford via bitcoin-dev announced that Bitcoin Core version 24.0.1 was available for download from the official website. The announcement also mentioned that version 24.0 had been tagged but not fully released due to some last-minute issues. However, the PGP signature on the email was found to be bad. It was later discovered that the announcement on the bitcoin-core-dev mailing list also had an invalid signature, likely due to a formatting error caused by sending the message as both text and HTML. Peter Todd commented on the issue, reminding users not to send HTML emails to the mailing list.</p>
