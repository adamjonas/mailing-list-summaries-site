        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group has scheduled their second meeting on Tuesday, December 20th at 18:00 UTC. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss contracting protocol use-cases and corresponding primitives, ensuring that all known ideas from the community are considered. Antoine Riard, a member of the group, encourages anyone who has been working on a primitive or use-case that is missing from the current listing to open a PR or contact him directly. The second part of the meeting will focus on addressing any blockers participants may have in their contracting primitives/covenant research and providing additional review on proposals if necessary. Communication for the group will take place on #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and logs from the previous session can be found on GitHub. Antoine's personal goal for this meeting is to continue developing a taproot annex implementation, which could serve as a fee-bumping primitive and constrained amount malleability extension for multi-party channels and other applications.</p>
