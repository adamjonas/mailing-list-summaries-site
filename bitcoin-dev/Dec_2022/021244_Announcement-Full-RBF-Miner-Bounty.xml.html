    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around preventing double-spending attacks by stopping the propagation of full RBF (replace-by-fee) replaced blocks. One user suggests running multiple nodes with a strict first-seen mempool policy to create a risk for miners that enable full-RBF, but others warn that enforcing mempool consistency could result in unintended chain splits. Peter Todd, who has raised money for this effort, explains the various transactions involved in the attack and claims that he can put lower bounds on the lack of significant hashrate mining with full-RBF policies. While there is evidence to suggest some miners used full-RBF in the past, they probably didn't reapply their patches each upgrade.</p>
