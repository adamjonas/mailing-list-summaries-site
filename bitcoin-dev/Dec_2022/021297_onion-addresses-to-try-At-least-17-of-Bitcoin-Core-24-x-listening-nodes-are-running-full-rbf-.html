    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent Bitcoin-dev thread, Peter Todd suggested the lack of a convenient source of onion addresses to try. However, Vasil Dimov pointed out that it is not that simple. Onion addresses cost close to nothing to obtain, so trying them on a one-time basis without checking their longer-term track record can be problematic. There is a risk of ending up with the addresses of a one-time Sybil attack.Dimov suggested using DNS seed records instead since those addresses are tested over long time frames, giving a better chance of representing real nodes. However, his DNS seed is not currently set up to track nodes using Tor.</p>
