    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from August 2014, Troy Benjegerdes expressed skepticism about trusting his financial future to software written by a group that cannot even organize enough to run their own hosting, web presence, or security measures. He argued that if a project cannot handle basic tasks such as installing an operating system and patching kernels, then it is unwise to trust them with something as crucial as one's financial future.However, another member of the email thread pushed back against Benjegerdes' hyperbole, stating that insults and ad hominem attacks are not conducive to productive dialogue. They pointed out that regardless of where a project's repositories live, their integrity is protected by digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. While running repositories elsewhere may have other benefits, it does not significantly impact the overall security of the software, as the same tools must be used to guarantee its security regardless of location.</p>
