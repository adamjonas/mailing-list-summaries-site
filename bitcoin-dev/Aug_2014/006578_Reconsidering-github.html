    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Troy Benjegerdes expressed his desire for a frontend and/or integration to Git/Mercurial that uses Bitcoin transactions as the signature. However, it was pointed out that a "Bitcoin transaction" can't serve as a signature on its own without additional infrastructure. It was suggested that if he wanted to timestamp a git commit, he could do so in the Bitcoin blockchain using code available in python-bitcoinlib. To check timestamps, he could use 'bitcoind searchrawtransactions' with the searchrawtransactions patch. The advantage of PGP over Bitcoin addresses is that it has vast amounts of identity infrastructure already developed for it. Nevertheless, secp256k1 has been added to the GPG development branch, which means code can be signed with an ECDSA key corresponding to a Bitcoin address.</p>
