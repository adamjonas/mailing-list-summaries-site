    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Troy Benjegerdes, the latter expressed concern over Bitcoin's dependence on Github as a potential security risk. In response, Wladimir asked if Troy would be interested in running a web-accessible mirror of the Bitcoin repositories. Troy then shared a link to his own repository, but stated that he needed dedicated servers, which he planned to fund through selling support contracts for crypto-commodities trading. Wladimir also mentioned the importance of understanding distributed revision control systems and their convergence to a coherent global state, a useful exercise in designing distributed systems, particularly in relation to Bitcoin's global consensus model. Finally, he emphasized the difficulty of detecting and removing malicious code that could be injected into the system by someone with root access on a Github server, highlighting the need for alternative solutions.</p>
