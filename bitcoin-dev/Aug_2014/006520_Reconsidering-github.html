    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik had expressed his thoughts that it would be better if the issues and git repository for Bitcoin Core were not centralized on Github, despite its convenience. However, Wladimir disagreed with the idea of moving to another platform. He stated that using Github has a low barrier to contribution since almost every open source developer already has an account with them. Switching to something self-hosted may make it more difficult for people to contribute. Additionally, hosting the platform themselves would require handling sysadmin work, which is not ideal considering the limited manpower available. Migration of all current issues and pulls would also be a lot of work. Thus, Wladimir did not see the point in moving to another platform and preferred the current way of working with Github.</p>
