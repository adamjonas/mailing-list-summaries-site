    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion regarding the value of encryption is taking place between Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd. Jeff claims that encryption is of little value if one can deduce the same information by observing packet sizes and timings. However, Peter disagrees with this statement, claiming that the resources required to perform such monitoring are high, and even the NSA cannot do so consistently. Jeff counters Peter's argument by giving an example of how a single observer at a single location could obtain a binary "likely|not bitcoin protocol" decision from a spike in usage correlated with sudden, global network activity after a period of inactivity. He does not go into detail about all such metrics. Jeff Garzik identifies himself as a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist who works for BitPay, Inc. The discussion seems to be centered around the security of the Bitcoin network and the role of encryption in maintaining that security.</p>
