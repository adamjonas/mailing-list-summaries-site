    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 6, 2014, Mark Friedenbach and Peter Todd had a discussion about the general case of committed information being included in transactions. Todd argued that the transmission of any Merkle data wasn't necessary since it could be derived from the transaction data itself. Friedenbach disagreed, stating that the validator needs to know whether there is an expiry or not. However, he added that the Merkle tree is used as a compatibility path and optimization for lite clients and applications. Todd recommended reading more about soft-forks and referencing the BIP. He also reminded Friedenbach that Bitcoin protocol development and deployment are not centrally controlled activities. The message ended with a PGP signature.</p>
