    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When checking the safety of a transaction, it is important to consider its dependencies up to a certain depth. If one of the inputs is dependent on a transaction that was signed by parties with unknown trustworthiness, then the transaction may not be safe. Additionally, if an input is dependent on a time-locked script or other unrecognized script, the transaction may also be unsafe. It is important to note that chance events, such as an "act of god," can now be introduced into the mix where they previously did not exist. This situation may require several extra lines of code to ensure safety. However, even with this added precaution, it may not be possible to depend on a deterministic and reliable mempool and reorganization behavior.</p>
