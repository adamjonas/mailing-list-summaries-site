    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named xor from the website <a href="https://freenetproject.org">https://freenetproject.org</a> wrote a response to Jeff Garzik's suggestion that Bitcoin Core should not have its issues and git repo centralized on Github. Xor argued that Github is useful because there are currently 4132 forks of Bitcoin on the site, which means contributions can be made by pull requests from a large number of developers. Xor emphasized that volunteer contributions need to be honored and made as easy as possible for people who invest their personal time. He also explained how GPG-signed commits and tags work, which ensures that Github cannot modify anything without breaking the signature. Xor stated that Github decentralization exists in pull-requests, where those dealing with them should verify tag and commit signatures carefully and not accept anything that is not signed. He also provided an article elaborating on some of the ways to ensure Github does not insert malicious code, although he warned that some of its recommendations are bad.</p>
