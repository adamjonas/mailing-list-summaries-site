    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>As an outsider looking in, a professional programmer with a thorough understanding of Bitcoin, the writer has not yet compiled their own copy of Bitcoin Core. While they have looked at pull requests on Github and cloned the repository to their computer, they have not used it extensively. They find Github easy to use and appreciate the extra security measures put in place such as signing commits and merges. The writer would like to see Bitcoin Core continue to use Github, but has no objections to additional mirrors of the repository being hosted on different sites.</p>
