    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a synchronization issue faced by the user while running a new node. The debug.log file showed an excessive number of orphaned blocks, which was around 19.5% of the total blocks at a height of 197,324. The user was concerned if a malicious party could generate chains of low difficulty blocks to slow down the sync process. In response to this, Bob McElrath explains that Bitcoin is very sensitive to hardware issues such as single bit flips in memory or computation. He suggests running a Python script attached to the email to check for sha256 mismatches. The script will run sha256 on random data repeatedly and print a message if a mismatch is found. Under-clocking the CPU and RAM is suggested as a solution to fix the problem caused by hardware issues. The email also includes links to the build and version information as well as compressed debug.log file and the Python script mentioned earlier.</p>
