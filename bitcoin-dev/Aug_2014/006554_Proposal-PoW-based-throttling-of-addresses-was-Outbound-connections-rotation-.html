    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses the difficulty of addressing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on Tor exit nodes used for connecting to Bitcoin. Requiring all clients to do complicated work would not solve the issue and make weak clients vulnerable to attacks while attackers' botnets solve PoWs. The article suggests that work prioritization and queueing mechanisms should be implemented to distinguish "good" clients from "bad" clients. However, preserving privacy while doing so is challenging. The only long-term solution may be requiring clients to present a cookie during resource exhaustion events to prove they have been around for a while and allow them to jump the queue.</p>
