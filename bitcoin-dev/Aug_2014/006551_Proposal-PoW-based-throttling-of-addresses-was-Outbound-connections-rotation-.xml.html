    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of the same set of nodes for posting transactions using unrelated inputs limits the privacy improvement that can be gained from using unrelated inputs. An attacker may conclude that two distinct transactions originated from the same user if they come from the same set of 8 peers with unrelated Bitcoin addresses. It is suggested that only the same set of nodes should be used for posting a subsequent transaction when the input addresses are also the same, similar to how Tor uses different circuits for different hosts to connect to. In addition, banning Tor exit nodes completely may not be the best approach. Instead, throttling them using a PoW-based access control scheme could be more effective. Misbehaving addresses can have their connecting difficulty scaled up, making it uneconomic to try to DoS the usage of Tor exit nodes for connecting to Bitcoin. This approach may also help nodes behind a NAT router if they share their global IP with misconfigured nodes.</p>
