        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Matt Whitlock suggests introducing a new script opcode that pushes the current block height onto the operand stack to implement arbitrary logic about which blocks the transaction can be valid in. This would require the client to revalidate all transactions in its mempool whenever the chain tip changes. Transactions that become invalid later may preclude transactions forever, even in the absence of fraud. Such outputs should be considered differently fungible- like coinbases which are immature and used with great caution, not as a mechanism for ordinary transactions.Matt Whitlock argues that transactions should not be considered "final" until they have a reasonable number of confirmations anyway, so the possibility that an "accepted" transaction could become invalid due to a chain reorganization is not a new danger. Ordinary transactions can similarly become invalid due to chain reorganizations, due to inputs already having been spent in the new branch. However, there is a distinction: transactions can only become invalid via a conflict- replaced by another transaction authored by the prior signers. If no other transaction could be created(e.g. you're a multisigner and won't sign it again), then there is no risk. The proposed idea introduces chance events("act of god") into the mix where they didn't exist before, making what was a very loose one-way coupling much tighter. It exposes more corner cases that it would expose, like flooding the network with unrelated high fee transactions to push a transaction out to where it can never be mined at all.</p>
