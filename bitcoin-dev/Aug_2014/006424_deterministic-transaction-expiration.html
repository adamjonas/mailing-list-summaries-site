    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of introducing a new field for expiration time in a new transaction version as a solution to nLockTime becoming invalid after some time. However, Jeff Garzik argues that existing users and uses of nLockTime will become worthless and it cannot be assumed that the user is around to rewrite their nLockTime if it fails to be confirmed before some arbitrary deadline being set. Tom Harding suggests that if nLockTime is used for expiration, the transaction creator can't lie to help the transaction live longer without pushing initial confirmation eligibility into the future. It would also enable "fill or kill" transactions with a backdated nLockTime, which must be confirmed in a few blocks or start vanishing from mempools.</p>
