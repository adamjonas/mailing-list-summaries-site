        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed his concern over the centralized service of Github hosting Bitcoin Core's issues and Git repos. In response, Pieter Wuille mentioned that they were aiming to have merges done through the GitHub-merge tool, which performs the merge locally, shows the resulting diff, compares it with the merge done by Github, and GnuPG signs it. The use of Github as easy-access mechanism for people to contribute and inspect is allowed while having a higher security standard for the actual changes done to master. Troy Benjegerdes believed that if a project cannot run its own hosting/web presence/counterintelligence/security that starts with installing an OS and patching kernels, then it is not wise to trust financial future to software written by such a group. Wuille responded with the statement that regardless of where the repositories live, their integrity is protected by digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. Running them elsewhere can be virtuous for other reasons, but it does not play much into this since the same tools must be used to guarantee their security.Garzik suggested putting the primary repository on bitcoin.org somewhere and simply mirroring that to Github for each push. He also noted that Linux does its own git repo and now requires 2FA. Wuille stated that Git does not care about whatâ€™s primary and if there is a working workflow elsewhere, then making a change will not be a leap of faith. Paul Rabahy gave a perspective on Github from an outsider's view - appreciating the extra time and effort that goes into signing commits and merges, even if he has not personally verified the signatures. He finds Github very easy to use and has no objection to additional mirrors of the repo being hosted on different sites. It was noted that nothing suggested would remove the ability to explore and read the changes just as one could do so already. Git itself is a decentralized system, regardless of Github's efforts to make it look otherwise.</p>
