    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik suggested that it would be nice if the issues and git repo for Bitcoin Core were not on such a centralized service as Github. However, Wladimir responded by saying that he didn't like the idea of moving to somewhere else. He stated that the current way of working with Github is fine with him because it has a low barrier to contribution and almost every open source developer already has a Github account. Wladimir also argued that switching to a self-hosted platform would make it difficult for people to contribute and would require them to handle sysadmin work themselves, which wouldn't be a good use of limited manpower available. Moreover, migrating all the current issues and pulls would be a lot of work, which he doesn't see the point of doing. In conclusion, keeping it simple is the best approach since there are many other more urgent questions to address in the development of Bitcoin Core.</p>
