        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On 13th August 2014, Richard Moore raised a query regarding the acceptance of invalid public keys and the significance of the 0x00 prefix in a multisig output script. Seeking clarification, he posted his question in an email. Another user advised him to refer to the Bitcoin Core script test cases and examine the source code for further insights. The user also mentioned that the Bitcoin protocol does not consider the validity of public keys. Notably, the email was signed off with a PGP signature.Meanwhile, RicMoo, the founder of Genetic Mistakes Software, made an intriguing discovery. He came across a transaction in the blockchain that featured an output script containing a public key. Seeking clarification on the permissibility and handling of invalid public keys, RicMoo decided to verify the blockchain himself using his own implementation. It's worth mentioning that the transaction had already been verified by a legitimate client.</p>
