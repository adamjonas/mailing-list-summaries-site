    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Bitcoin developers, the idea of delegating processing of unknown messages to an external process was brought up as a way to compose a P2P node out of separated programs. The goal would be to create a service that is indistinguishable at the network layer from one provided by Bitcoin Core itself. This idea was seconded by another developer, with both suggesting that command plug-ins and similar mechanisms could be explored instead of having to integrate everything into bitcoind. Jeff Garzik, a core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, expressed support for the idea as well.</p>
