        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2014, a user named 潘庆庆 reached out to the Bitcoind community via email, questioning why the '-flushwallet' option is set to true by default. They had disabled it and noticed a significant reduction in IO, but encountered a problem when all their coins were lost in testnet after a crash. Wladimir, a member of the community, explained that disabling flushwallet means the wallet is not periodically flushed, which increases the likelihood of the wallet database being inconsistent if the process abruptly stops due to a crash or unexpected power outage. This inconsistency can lead to failure during the processing of log files, requiring manual recovery. Given the critical nature of the wallet, it is advised not to disable this option.A user named Qing Qing Pan from okcoin.com shared their experience with reducing the IO of bitcoind by using the "-flushwallet=false" option. They observed a significant reduction in IO after enabling it. However, they raised concerns about why the flushwallet option is true by default and whether there are any risks associated with closing the flush wallet thread. Pan also mentioned losing all their coins in testnet after a crash with the "-flushwallet=false" setting, prompting them to question if this was due to the absence of a flush wallet thread. These inquiries shed light on the default settings of the flushwallet option and its potential impact on the security of Bitcoin transactions.</p>
