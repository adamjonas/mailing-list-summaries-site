        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of this message is proposing the creation of an optional identity layer for Bitcoin called Custodial Identities. This layer would be managed by a Bitcoin Assigned Custodial Identities Authority which would delegate Custodial Identity Spaces to Regional Bitcoin Custodial Identity Registries. A Bitcoin Custodial Identity (BCI) account address would consist of a Custodial Identifier allocated by the BACIA/RBCIRs and an account address, allowing for dispute resolution in the legal system for transactions in the BCI address space. This proposal suggests that Custodial Identities could be applied to coinbase transactions as well, providing further incentive to keep nodes honest or enabling a recovery mechanism in catastrophic failure events. Custodians would provide account addresses out of unused address space, alleviating address collisions as a psychological barrier to adoption. The proposal also suggests that custodial to non-custodial transactions could behave much like the UTXO of a coinbase transaction, based on open market competition.Overall, the author believes that there are many applications beyond dispute resolution for Custodial Identities, if they can be effortlessly injected into the blockchain itself as easily as providing 1-of-2 public keys. The proposal aims to create an identity layer for Bitcoin, which would allow for greater transparency and accountability in transactions. Before submitting a BIP, the author proposed the need for an optional identity layer in Bitcoin. They suggest creating a Bitcoin Assigned Custodial Identities Authority (BACIA) to oversee global Custodial Identity allocation. Similar to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that manage the allocation of Internet number resources, the BACIA would delegate Custodial Identity Spaces to Regional Bitcoin Custodial Identity Registries (RBCIRs). Free market forces would drive and determine the demand for custodial accounts, but P2PKH users would not be affected. Feedback on the proposal is appreciated from the community.</p>
