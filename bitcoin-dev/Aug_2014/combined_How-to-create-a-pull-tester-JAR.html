        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The pull tester entry point for the bitcoinj library can be found on GitHub. However, it is mentioned that the library will soon have a new namespace from com.google.bitcoin to org.bitcoinj, which means the provided link may break in the future. Additionally, the code itself is not considered ideal as it involves copy/paste coding and will be refactored soon by Matt. Therefore, anyone planning to add tests to the framework should coordinate with Matt to avoid conflicts with the ongoing refactor/rewrite process.In an email dated August 5th, 2014, Mike Hearn discussed the default package repository used by Maven, stating that it was not protected by SSL until recently. He mentioned that a new release with SSL as the default setting would be coming soon. He also filed a wishlist item on <a href="https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5672">https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5672</a> and a bug report on <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/maven/+bug/1352418">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/maven/+bug/1352418</a> regarding this issue.The email thread provides instructions for creating a pull tester JAR. It requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6 or higher, Apache Maven, and git. To build the JAR, one needs to clone bitcoinj from git master and run the command "mvn -DskipTests package". This will download the necessary libraries, compile the code, and create a bundled executable JAR file called core/target/pull-tests.jar. The JAR file can be used with the QA scripts in the bitcoin core qa/pull-tester directory or run directly using specific commands. It is emphasized that the same version of javac and bitcoinj should be used to easily reproduce the JARs.Recently, it was discovered that Maven's default package repository was not protected by SSL until a few days ago. Although it is now available via SSL, users need to inform Maven about the new URL before running 'mvn'. In the future, Maven will release a new version where SSL is the default setting. For now, users can save the provided settings.xml file to their path ~/.m2/ to ensure secure access to the central repository. The settings.xml file includes information on the two repositories, one being the newly secured 'securecentral' and the other being 'central', which still uses the unsecured URL. Both repositories have the 'enabled' tag set to true.The author also offers to provide a pull-tests.jar from their local machine if anyone needs it.</p>
