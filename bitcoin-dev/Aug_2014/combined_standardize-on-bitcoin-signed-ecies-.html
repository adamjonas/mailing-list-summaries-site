        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2014, a user named Mem Wallet proposed a standardized PGP-style message for Bitcoin transactions in an email thread. The proposal aimed to allow users to send signed encrypted messages using only public and private Bitcoin keys. However, using the same keys for signing and encryption is generally considered bad practice due to security concerns. Implementing encryption in Bitcoin software has proven to be difficult in the past, with previous attempts being flawed and insecure.The author of the email expressed doubts about the proposal receiving adequate review and highlighted the significant security concerns and implementation challenges that need to be addressed. Despite this, the Bitcoin community continues to discuss the potential benefits of creating a standardized PGP-style message protocol.If implemented, the protocol would enable users to encrypt messages with their private key and decrypt them with their public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message. This would add an extra layer of security to Bitcoin transactions, as users could include important information such as payment instructions or addresses in an encrypted message.Supporters of the proposal argue that it could improve the privacy and security of Bitcoin transactions. However, others remain skeptical of its usefulness. Nevertheless, the proposal showcases the ongoing efforts within the Bitcoin community to enhance the functionality and security of the network.</p>
