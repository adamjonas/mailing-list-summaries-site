    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer suggests a mechanism where Bitcoin node can delegate processing of unknown messages to an external process, allowing a P2P node to be created from separated programs indistinguishable from those provided by Bitcoin Core itself. This would enable Insight to offer a command set that extends the p2p protocol for doing block explorer type queries without having the protocol being Insight specific. The biggest win from having some separated protocol would be the ability to use TLS, but this doesn't add much if you're connecting to an IP address rather than a domain name. The writer also points out that nothing in this spec requires a local bitcoind to be running. It is possible to advertise just NODE_EXTENDED_SERVICES and nothing else. While the writer acknowledges that a generic service advertisement mechanism isn't a bad thing to have, they point out that nothing makes this more focused than the service bits already are.</p>
