    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the Bitcoin community, there is a proposal to create a standardized PGP-style message that would allow users to send signed encrypted messages using only public and private bitcoin keys. The proposal aims to create a signed encrypted message protocol in case it is seen as valuable to encode such a thing into a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The protocol would enable users to encrypt messages with their private key and decrypt them with their public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message. It would also add an extra layer of security to Bitcoin transactions, as users could include important information such as payment instructions or addresses in an encrypted message. The proposal has yet to be implemented, but it remains a topic of discussion within the Bitcoin community. Those who support the idea argue that it could improve the privacy and security of Bitcoin transactions, while others are skeptical of its usefulness. Nonetheless, the proposal highlights the ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality and security of the Bitcoin network.</p>
