    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Ivan Pustogarov shared his attempt to address an attack on the Bitcoin network. This attack is described in detail at <a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Bitcoin">https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Bitcoin</a> and was discussed on a forum thread at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=632124.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=632124.0</a>. The attack takes advantage of the fact that each NATed client connects to the Bitcoin network through 8 entry peers and advertises their public IP address to these peers. An attacker can use this information to create a mapping of the nodes on the network. In response to Pustogarov's proposal, the recipient of the email asked for clarification on how this mapping would be produced. The recipient raised concerns about the difficulty of distinguishing advertised peers based on their distance from the advertiser.</p>
