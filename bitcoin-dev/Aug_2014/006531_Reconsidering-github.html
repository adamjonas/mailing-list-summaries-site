    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent in August of 2014, Jeff Garzik suggested that it would be beneficial if the issues and git repository for Bitcoin Core were not on such a centralized service as GitHub. Garzik noted that Linux had created its own git repo and implemented two-factor authentication as a security measure. He suggested that Bitcoin Core could take a similar approach and put the primary repository on bitcoin.org while mirroring it to GitHub for each push.Garzik suggested that setting up a second repository would be the obvious thing to do and that Git does not care which repository is considered "primary." He emphasized that if Bitcoin Core has a working workflow elsewhere, making a change to the repository's location should not be a leap of faith.</p>
