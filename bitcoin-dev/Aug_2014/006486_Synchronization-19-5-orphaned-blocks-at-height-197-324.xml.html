    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is currently synchronizing a new node, and at the progress of a height of 197'324 blocks, they have counted an aweful amount of 38'447 orphaned blocks which is about 19.5%. This seems like a high number to the writer, and they are wondering if it's possible for a malicious party to generate chains of blocks with low difficulty that are not part of the main chain to slow down the sync process.The writer provides some build and version information, including the address index from sipa/jmcorgan and a rebase with almost up-to-date mainline from Bitcoin. Additionally, a compressed debug.log file is attached, which has a size of 7.67 MB and uncompressed size of 41.3 MB.</p>
