    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from September 3, 2011, John Smith expressed interest in Rob Meijer's proposed updated MinorFs that can be used by Bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor, such as Ubuntu and OpenSuse. Smith noted that stricter privilege separation between applications on a least-authority basis is necessary for Ubuntu to keep up with Android and MacOSX. He also mentioned the need for OS-level protection for private data managed by applications running as the same user, citing examples like SSH, browsers, and PGP. Meijer had put down the initial set of specs for a rewrite of MinorFs, which he plans to do in Python instead of Perl due to compatibility issues with rare perl modules. The new version will be built on top of current Unix/ACL permissions, similar to the android model with a UID per application/user. Meijer also plans to introduce finer granularity levels where subsystems delegate sub-trees to each other in a pass-by-reference way.</p>
