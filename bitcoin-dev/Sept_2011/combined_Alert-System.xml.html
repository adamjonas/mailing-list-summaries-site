    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In September 2011, a discussion was held regarding the use of the alert system in Bitcoin. David Perry questioned whether anyone aside from Satoshi had the ability to send an alert and suggested that the current developers should have this privilege to ensure security in case Satoshi's key had been compromised. Pieter agreed with Perry and stated that there may come a moment when the alert system will be needed to ask people to upgrade to recent versions of the client. Moreover, Gavin was mentioned as being the person who has the ability to send an alert since Satoshi transferred the key to him. However, some argued that it was unnecessary to make the key-holder send out two alerts for old and new clients, and there was little chance that Satoshi would let his key get compromised. It is essential to note that the alerts are just messages that do not make any functional difference.Perry also discussed the potential for abuse of the alert protocol on the new Bitcoin StackExchange site and forked bitcoin/bitcoin, removed the snippet of code from main.cpp that makes the questionable call, and submitted a pull request. This led to a debate about whether the alert system is valuable, an unnecessary risk, or merely a deprecated code. Gavin believed that the feature is still more useful than dangerous and would argue against removing it. The alert system requires a signature verification when it receives an alert, making it not a DoS target. In other software, the alert system carries a risk for abuse or seems wrong that developers can send a message to everyone's computer to notify them of something. Still, the Bitcoin financial software requires an urgent notification method, which is precisely what alerts provide. Since alerts no longer carry the ability to put Bitcoin into RPC safe-mode, they are simply messages and should not be removed.</p>
