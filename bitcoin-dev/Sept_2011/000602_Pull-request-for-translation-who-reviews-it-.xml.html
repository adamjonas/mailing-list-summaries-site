    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this message has posted a question on a forum regarding making improvements to the Swedish translation of a client. They understand the technical side of making a pull request but are unsure if their request will be accepted. They are concerned that since there aren't many people in the project who can judge the quality of the Swedish translation, it may simply be accepted if no one opposes it. The previous Swedish translations were committed by someone named codler, and the writer is wondering if this person is "responsible" for the Swedish translation. Additionally, they are curious if there is anywhere they can view a list of people who have permissions to make a pull request.</p>
