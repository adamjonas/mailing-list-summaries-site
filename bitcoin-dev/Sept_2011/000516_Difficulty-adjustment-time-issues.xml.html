    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context suggests that fixing the issue related to inaccurate system clocks is easier and can be done by incorporating an NTP library or removing Bitcoin mining code from the client. However, the author believes that requiring pools and miners to have accurate-to-within-a-minute system clocks seems reasonable. While incorporating NTP may seem like overkill, most OSes come with NTP support integrated these days, and there is no excuse for not running it, especially on a server. The author suggests that running NTP on the system is necessary if one wants to produce blocks that the rest of the network will accept. Therefore, requiring accurate system clocks for miners sounds very reasonable to the author.</p>
