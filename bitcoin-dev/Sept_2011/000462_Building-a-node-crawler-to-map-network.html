    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian suggests Steve to look at BitDroid, which is an easily extensible network client built on top of NIO and a simple publish-subscribe architecture. It does not have any crypto stuff yet, but Christian built a crawler with just a single class that subscribes to events published and opens/closes connections to crawl. Steve asks a question regarding the getaddr message, but then finds a set of articles in the Dev & Tech forum which answers his question. He has been running v0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1 for about an hour and shares some early results such as new nodes, contacted nodes, uncontactable nodes, limbo nodes, total nodes, versions and fails. Finally, there is a special offer to download ArcSight Logger for free.</p>
