    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Douglas Huff and Luke-Jr, they discussed the proper handling of private keys in offline transaction signing. Luke-Jr suggested that once a transaction is created, it should be submitted to a staff member with proper authority who would then use an offline transaction-signing wallet on a USB key to sign the transaction before sending it back to a third wallet. However, Douglas raised concerns about storing private keys on NAND and the potential data recovery issues that could arise. Luke-Jr clarified that the USB stick would only contain the transaction being approved and the offline-signing-wallet would handle the signing process, ensuring that private keys were not stored on the USB stick at any point.</p>
