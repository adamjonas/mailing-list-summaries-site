    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the #bitcoin-dev forum, Chris Double queried whether casting was being used in an incorrect manner in relation to using the CWalletTxn size. He questioned whether he was tired and reading it wrong or if late night programmer syndrome had set in. After further discussion, it was determined that Double was mistaken in his belief that the GetSerializeSize method in CTransaction and CWalletTxn were virtual. Since they're not, everything worked fine, and there is no need for concern.</p>
