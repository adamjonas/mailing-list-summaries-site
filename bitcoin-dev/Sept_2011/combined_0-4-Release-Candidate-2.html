        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ThiagoCMC, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum, expressed his preference for a feature that automatically creates a new Bitcoin address in his address book every time he receives a Bitcoin amount. He labels each dynamic address with something like "DINAMIC-1," "DINAMIC-2," and uses them randomly following the moon phase. ThiagoCMC believes there is nothing to fear about people knowing his Bitcoin address as it can be found under the "Receiving" tab. Another user, John Smith, asked ThiagoCMC for his rationale behind tracking all his Bitcoin addresses. John Smith advised that the option to automatically create new Bitcoin addresses should be left as an option but disabled by default. ThiagoCMC suggested that the option should include an explanation for increasing anonymity.In a separate message thread, user Martinx also expressed appreciation for the feature that automatically generates a new address in his "AddressBook" whenever he receives Bitcoin. Martinx questioned why others prefer creating a new receiving address for each contact that sends them Bitcoin and labeling it themselves. Another user, JS, responded to Martinx's post and explained that most people prefer to create new receiving addresses themselves and label them to avoid confusion and uncertainty about the purpose of unlabeled addresses. JS stated that while he is okay with adding the automatic address generation feature back as an option, he prefers it to be disabled by default.Gavin Andresen, the lead developer of Bitcoin, announced the release of v0.4.00rc2, which includes optimizations for transactions with lots of inputs, fixes for deadlocks, and potential problems with duplicate, un-spendable coinbase transactions. The release addressed several issues from the previous release candidate, including optimizing database writes for transactions with numerous inputs, fixing a deadlock when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC, and resolving a potential problem with duplicate, unspendable coinbase transactions if generating bitcoins with a locked wallet and running out of keypool keys.Gavin Andresen tagged the git tree as v0.4.00rc2, fixing issues from the previous release candidate. The fixes included optimizing database writes for transactions with lots of inputs, fixing a deadlock when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC, and addressing a potential problem with duplicate, un-spendable coinbase transactions if generating bitcoins with a locked wallet and running out of keypool keys.In an announcement on September 9th, 2011, Gavin Andresen provided signed builds of v0.4.00rc2 for download on SourceForge.

Jeff Garzik from exMULTI, Inc. inquired about uploading the source code and builds to SF.Gavin Andresen announced the tagging of the git tree (v0.4.00rc2) and listed a few fixes from release candidate 1. These included optimization of database writes for transactions with numerous inputs, fixing a potential problem with duplicate, unspendable coinbase transactions if keypool keys ran out while generating bitcoins with a locked wallet, and resolving a deadlock that could occur when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC.

Gavin mentioned that he was too lazy to make nice tars, so he provided the raw gitian output, and the setup exe still wasn't deterministic. He planned on working out gitian-downloader stuff within the next couple of days.Gavin Andresen, the lead developer of Bitcoin, has tagged a new git tree with v0.4.00rc2. This release candidate includes several fixes, such as optimizing database writes for transactions with a large number of inputs, fixing a deadlock issue when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC, and addressing a potential problem related to duplicate and un-spendable coinbase transactions.
