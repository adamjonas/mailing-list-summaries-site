    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted on September 22, 2011 by user Martinx on the BitcoinTalk forum, he expressed his appreciation for a feature that automatically generates a new address in his "AddressBook" whenever he receives Bitcoin. He went on to say that he likes to track these new addresses and asked about the rationale behind others' workflows of creating a new receiving address for each contact that sends them Bitcoin and labeling it themselves. Another user, identified as JS, responded to Martinx's post and explained that most people prefer to create new receiving addresses themselves and label them to avoid confusion and uncertainty about the purpose of unlabeled addresses. They may reuse the same address for a particular contact or create a new one for every transaction. JS stated that while he is okay with adding the automatic address generation feature back as an option, he prefers it to be disabled by default. The post also included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed and its content is unknown.</p>
