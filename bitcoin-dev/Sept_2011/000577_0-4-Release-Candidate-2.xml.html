    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message shared is the output when the network goes down and Bitcoin is closed. It shows an unknown exception which is a segmentation fault. In the conversation, Thiago expresses his liking for the feature that every time he receives some Bitcoin amount, a new address appears in his "AddressBook" automatically, and he likes to track it. He mentions having two kinds of addresses; static addresses created personally and dynamic addresses generated automatically when receiving Bitcoin amounts. He labels each dynamic address with something like "DINAMIC-1", "DINAMIC-2," and so on, and uses them randomly following the moon phase. Thiago states that he likes to keep track of all his bitcoin addresses, both static and dynamic, and requests to leave this feature alive as an option, disabled by default, as he sees no need to fear about his own address. He suggests adding explanations to the options screen about enabling the "Dynamic Bitcoin Address" option to increase anonymity and not linking each address with one's person. John Smith responds to Thiago's request saying he is fine with adding it back as an option, but it should be left disabled by default.</p>
