        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion in the given context revolves around the addition of multisignature transactions to the Bitcoin codebase. The new transaction types (a and b), (a or b), and (a and b) or c have been added, which will enable better wallet security and backup in future versions of Bitcoin. However, potential attacks need to be avoided.It is important to note that these new transaction types will be relayed and included in blocks, but they are ignored by the wallet code. Hence, they will not affect the balance and will never be considered available to spend. Multisignature transactions are not credited/added to the wallet to avoid potential issues.Going forward, multisignature transactions will only be added to the wallet's balance and made available to spend if the public half of all the keys involved is known to the wallet. It is crucial that the public key must be known and in the wallet, even if the private half of the key may not be in the wallet. Dispute mediation (2-of-3) will not be supported with this pull.In September 2011, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn sent an email discussing initial support for three new types of transactions: (a and b), (a or b), and (a and b) or c. There were concerns about whether dispute mediation (2-of-3) would still be supported and if CHECKMULTISIG for small numbers of keys would be allowed.Gavin Andresen suggested using a prototype for a normal escrow transaction that involves two out of three parties agreeing on a transaction as it was more useful than using (a or b) as an example. Andresen noted that it is possible to replicate the functionality of (a or b) using the two of three models, but this would be inefficient and require the use of a public known key as one of the roles.Andresen also discussed adding more "standard" transaction types in the future. He took a conservative approach with the initial pull, where the new transaction types would be relayed and included in blocks but are ignored by the wallet code.There were discussions of potential attacks, such as attackers having an account and a funding address/key at a shared-wallet service. They could send bitcoins that can be spent by (a or b), and the shared-wallet service assumes that it controls all the keys in its wallet, but the attacker can spend using "b" anytime they like.Andresen suggested creating a clean pull request, unit tests, and test plan for an "IsStandard" 2-of-3 transaction either using CHECKMULTISIG or groffers proposal. The low-level support is relatively easy, but reporting these transactions in listtransactions and figuring out if or how to report them in your wallet balance is tricky.Finally, Andresen generated and then spent three multisig transactions on testnet using the code he used to send them, which is not intended for the mainline bitcoin. He suggested that the new transaction types would enable better wallet security and backup in future versions of bitcoin.</p>
