    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed the potential for additional 'standard' transaction types to be added in the future. He noted that the example of two of three was a more useful prototype for a normal escrow transaction. This method would still only result in three addresses and at most two signatures, similar to the (A and B) or C case.It was also mentioned that the functionality of (a or b) could be replicated using two of three through the use of a public known key as one of the roles. Mike Hearn questioned whether dispute mediation (2-of-3) would not be supported, since he thought the plan was also to allow CHECKMULTISIG for smallish numbers of keys.Finally, there was discussion around the ease of omitting useful cases and the importance of full RPN boolean validation, despite it being harder to achieve good testing confidence.</p>
