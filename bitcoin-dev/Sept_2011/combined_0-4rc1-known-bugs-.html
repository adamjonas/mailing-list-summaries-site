        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen provided an update on the development of Bitcoin version 0.4, mentioning that he might not have enough time to address certain issues before Tuesday. One such issue was a potential deadlock between the address handling and IRC join handling code, which had been identified by sipa. Pieter compiled bitcoind with Gavin's DEBUG_LOCKORDER and fixed two potential reported deadlock issues, but the problem persisted despite no longer receiving deadlock warnings.Pieter discovered that starting up bitcoin with an empty addr.dat file seemed to cause the issue every few attempts, leading him to wonder if there was locked code waiting for an event that never occurred. Overall, this context highlights some of the technical challenges involved in developing Bitcoin at this stage.</p>
