    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke-Jr and Gavin Andresen had a discussion on whether non-standard transactions with insufficient fees should be penalized. Luke-Jr argued that such transactions should not be punished but instead made more easily configurable as they are policy decisions for relay/miner. He also suggested that although there may be some legitimate non-standard transactions, most of them are not. Hence, assigning a point or two of badness to peers sending them is reasonable. However, he acknowledged that this judgment might need to be adjusted as the network evolves.</p>
