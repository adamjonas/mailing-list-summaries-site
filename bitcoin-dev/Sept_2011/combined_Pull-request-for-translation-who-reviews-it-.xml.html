        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user named David from Bitcoin.se is seeking information about improving the Swedish translation of the client. However, he is not sure if his request will be accepted as there are not many people in the project who can judge the quality of the Swedish translation. The previous Swedish translations were committed by someone named Codler, but no one is responsible for translations in Bitcoin. It would be beneficial if people agreed to keep their translations up-to-date when they submit new ones. David inquires about a list of people who have permissions to make a pull and is informed that anyone can make a pull request. Still, only Gavin, tcatm, sipa, jgarzik, and alexwaters can push to the bitcoin repo (i.e., can pull a pull request). Most developers tend to ignore or treat the forums as write-only due to the abundance of junk in them, so it is recommended to directly contact the developers instead.</p>
