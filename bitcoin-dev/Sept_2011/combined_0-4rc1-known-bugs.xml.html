    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille reported fixing two potential deadlock issues in bitcoind and compiled it with Gavin's DEBUG_LOCKORDER, which pointed out a possible deadlock between the addr-handling and IRC-join-handling code. Sipa had found what looked like a deadlock issue between these two as well. Internally, DB uses pthreads to implement the txn_begin()/commit() scheme, which needs to be considered when searching for deadlocks. Gavin Andresen reported that he wouldn't have time to tackle these issues before Tuesday. UukGoblin also reported a deadlock problem on a bitcoind handling getwork requests. ArtForz found a performance bug with transactions that have thousands of inputs and outputs on the solidcoin test network. Meanwhile, Gitian doesn't build properly, which was Gavin's fault. A solution was proposed in main.cpp, ProcessMessage, case "addr" to fix the actual deadlock between IRC seeding and AddAddress.</p>
