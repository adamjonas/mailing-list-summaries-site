    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 9, 2011, Gavin Andresen announced the tagging of the git tree (v0.4.00rc2) and listed a few fixes from release candidate 1. These included optimization of database writes for transactions with numerous inputs, fixing a potential problem with duplicate, unspendable coinbase transactions if keypool keys ran out while generating bitcoins with a locked wallet, and resolving a deadlock that could occur when adding addresses from 'addr' messages and IRC. The bitcoin-ubuntu-v0.4.00rc2.zip and bitcoin-win32-v0.4.00rc2.zip files are available for download at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/</a> along with their SHA1s. However, Gavin mentioned that he was too lazy to make nice tars, so he provided the raw gitian output, and the setup exe still wasn't deterministic. He also planned on working out gitian-downloader stuff within the next couple of days.</p>
