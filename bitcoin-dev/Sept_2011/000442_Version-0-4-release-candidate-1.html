    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 2, 2011, Gavin Andresen announced the release of Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 and asked for initial testing. The source code was available on Github for users to try and break it. The most significant visible change in this release was wallet private key encryption, which was not turned on by default. Meanwhile, an invisible change was a reworking of internal critical section mutexes, which addressed chronic issues with bitcoind becoming unresponsive due to deadlocks. One user congratulated Andresen for the update and noted that the mutex overhaul was much needed. They expressed their happiness to see the project moving quickly all of a sudden.</p>
