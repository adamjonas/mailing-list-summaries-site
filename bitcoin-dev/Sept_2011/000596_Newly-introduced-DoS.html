    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Luke-Jr on September 26, 2011, they discussed the issue of "DoS"-ing transactions with out-of-bounds SigOpCount and spending coinbase at depth. Luke-Jr argued that these transactions should not be DoS-ed as it might lead to legitimate nodes being denied service. However, Andresen explained that in case of a scheduled change to acceptable block rules, denying service to nodes running old versions of Bitcoin might be necessary. He also mentioned that the third DoS rule in AcceptBlock() is a "should be impossible" case. The first transaction referred to was a non-standard sig op count, which is allowed in blocks but not accepted by mainline rules, while the second transaction was not tied to a specific block. An attacker could potentially use these things to get nodes to ban each other.</p>
