    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Rob Meijer announced the initial set of specifications for a rewrite of MinorFS. He expressed disappointment in receiving no response to his previous post about interest in using this updated version with Bitcoin on systems that support AppArmor like Ubuntu and OpenSuse. However, others in the thread expressed their interest in this update. One individual stated that more strict privilege separation between applications would be necessary for Ubuntu if they want to keep up with Android and MacOSX. They noted that this has been needed for a while and would be useful for any private data managed by applications running as the same user, such as SSH, browsers, and PGP. The discussion then turned to security measures, with one participant noting that wallet encryption is useful but not a substitute for OS-level protection. In response to Rob's announcement, an individual asked if it was necessary to rewrite the entire thing from scratch and questioned whether it could be compared to the Android model which uses a UID per application/user. They wondered if layering security on top of current UNIX/ACL permissions would be sufficient without needing another filesystem altogether.</p>
