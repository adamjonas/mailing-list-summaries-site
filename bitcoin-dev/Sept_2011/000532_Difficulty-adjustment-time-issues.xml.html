    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers on September 14, 2011, Gregory Maxwell expressed his disagreement with Luke Dashjr's suggestion to fix the root cause of an issue even if it forks the chain. Maxwell highlighted that he does not support such a move unless all other chain-forking-needed changes are made simultaneously. He also pointed out that changing the time rules would not help the situation. Maxwell disagreed with Dashjr's argument about the burden placed on one pool operator with regards to scaling and noted that other pools cope with bitcoind scaling without excessive dependence on ntime rolling. However, Maxwell explained that the problem lies in the fact that not all miners generate rewards immediately as the same block being mined. They either have to bear the loss of invalid blocks or wait for over 100 confirmations before getting paid. Additionally, he cautioned that restricting the time rules would break miners without rollntime support such as Phoenix.</p>
