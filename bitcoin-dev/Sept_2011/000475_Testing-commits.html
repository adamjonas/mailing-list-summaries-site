    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alex Waters is working on creating a stable build environment for testers. He plans to build bitcoin 4.0 source in both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11, create a package of build dependencies, and upload them to SF. Additionally, he will write instructions for the build process. Alex has compiled a list of commits that need testing in both environments and is requesting help from others to prioritize pull requests. Linking pull requests to <a href="https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2">https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2</a> with any priority commits for testing or test cases will help in processing important and easy ones quickly. Although it is not a requirement for pull requests, it will be helpful to prioritize them. Alex is open to discussing other ways of prioritizing pull requests, but for now, this method appears to be sufficient.</p>
