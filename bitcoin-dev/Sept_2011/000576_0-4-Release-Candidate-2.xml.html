    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ThiagoCMC, a user on bitcointalk, expressed his preference for the feature that automatically creates a new Bitcoin address in his address book every time he receives a Bitcoin amount. ThiagoCMC labels each automatic address with something like "DINAMIC-1", "DINAMIC-2" and so on and uses his dynamic address randomly following the moon phase. He requested that this feature should be kept as an option which is disabled by default. ThiagoCMC believes there is nothing to fear about people knowing his Bitcoin address as it can be found under the "Receiving" tab. John Smith, another user on bitcointalk, asked ThiagoCMC for his rationale behind tracking all his Bitcoin addresses. He observed that most people create a new receiving address for each new contact that sends them bitcoins and label it themselves before giving out the generated address. John Smith advised that the option to automatically create new Bitcoin addresses should be left as an option but disabled by default. ThiagoCMC suggested that the option should include an explanation for increasing anonymity.</p>
