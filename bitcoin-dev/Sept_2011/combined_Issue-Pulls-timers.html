        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made to add timers to the pulls and issues on GitHub for Bitcoin's client. The timers would close outdated or stale requests after 15 days, with corresponding labels assigned to each. Requests that are closed in this manner can be reopened through QA at BitcoinTesting.org. The aim of adding the timers is to cut down on stagnant requests and prioritise attention on priority items while phasing out unwanted changes. However, it was noted that abrupt closure of pull requests should be avoided, and instead, an automated warning email should be sent first to describe the policy, why it exists, and how to avoid automated report closure. The comment added to the pull request should also describe how to rebase a commit and what the standard expectations are. The proposal was made to clear out some of the older pulls/issues that exist. It is hoped that in the future, the QA process will be good enough that pulls/issues won't fall behind from lack of testing - and the timers will be used very sparingly. To elaborate on the automated warning email, it will be triggered when an issue becomes outdated. The email will explain the policy and the reasons for it. It will also provide guidance on how to prevent the issue from being closed automatically. A detailed message that links to a rebase walkthrough will be added before the timer starts.</p>
