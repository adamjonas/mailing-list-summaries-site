        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In September 2011, a group of Bitcoin developers discussed the challenges and potential risks associated with balancing the need for bug fixes with introducing new code into the system. The primary concern being addressed in this discussion was providing a stable base for miners, banks, and web services to apply patches on top of. Currently, those who want to keep up with development are stuck forward porting against often disruptive changes, which leads to people trailing development on their systems by many months, which isn't healthy for the network.Gavin Andresen expressed his initial reaction of not being willing to maintain two release lines alongside testing and bug-fixing being the bottleneck for making core Bitcoin better. He suggested that until they reach a "1.0" version that is ready for everybody to use, using the word "stable" would be dishonest. However, Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik suggested that a stable version is a good idea for providing a stable base for miners, banks, and webservices to apply patches on top of.To encourage open discussion and development, Luke-Jr set up a process for proposing changes to the Bitcoin protocol. He suggested that bitcoin.org should eventually look like bittorrent.org by serving as a neutral platform for discussions among developers. However, Gavin reminded everyone to prioritize testing and bug fixing before releasing any new version. He encouraged anyone who clicks the pull button to test their code and write down how they tested it.The Linux development model was discussed as a potential framework for Bitcoin. The model involves introducing new features followed by a stabilization and bug fix period before the next version is released. A stable branch can be maintained for longer-term use, in which case an employee or volunteer backports fixes from the main tree into their own stable branch. The community decides which versions are important to maintain long term.A group of developers proposed maintaining a stable 0.4.x branch of Bitcoin for bug fixes only, as the current development model risks introducing new bugs when improvements are made alongside fixes. The lack of a stable branch means that those who wish to get bugfixes are forced to either create their own stable branch or risk getting all the new bugs introduced in the latest version. The proposal suggests that a stable branch would make it easier to maintain a stable+ branch with greater ease.This email thread highlights the challenges and potential risks associated with balancing the need for bug fixes with the introduction of new code into a system. It is acknowledged that a stable branch alone will not sufficiently address the issue. Rather, a robust quality assurance process is needed for bug hammering and processing pull requests to move closer to a stable 1.0 release. Eventually, it is hoped that Bitcoin.org will serve as a forum for developers to exchange ideas about the direction of Bitcoin.</p>
