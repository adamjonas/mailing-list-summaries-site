    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin version 0.4.0 has been released with the main feature of wallet private key encryption. This means that a passphrase must be entered before sending coins, providing protection against theft. However, if the passphrase is forgotten or lost, access to the bitcoins in the wallet will be lost as well. It is recommended that users write down their passphrase and store it in a secure location. Additionally, version 0.4 uses a newer version of Berkeley DB than previous versions, which could cause issues when reverting back to an older version.To enable wallet encryption, users should choose "Encrypt Wallet" from the Options menu and enter a passphrase. The encryption only protects the keys required for sending bitcoins, not the full wallet. Therefore, someone who steals the wallet file will still be able to see all addresses belonging to the user. It is advised to backup the wallet file before encrypting it, as once it is encrypted, the user will never be able to go back to a version of the Bitcoin client older than 0.4.Users are responsible for their own security and should practice good security measures such as running up-to-date antivirus software, entering the wallet passphrase only in the Bitcoin client, and using the same passphrase only as the wallet passphrase. The full changelog can be found at the link provided.</p>
