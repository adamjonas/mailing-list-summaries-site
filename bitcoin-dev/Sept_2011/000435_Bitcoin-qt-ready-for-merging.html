    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of porting existing translations in a project. The strings in the core can be reused as the function is mapped to the Qt translation function. Some of the UI texts can be reused as well, but the files will have to be converted because Qt uses an XML-based format while Wx uses a line-based one. The translations have a "context" defined in Qt while in Wx, the "msgid" is only the English text. However, this can be solved with Python hacking. It is suggested that it's not necessary to merge all the translations when Qt is merged into the project. Instead, translations can be added gradually during the time between merging and phasing out Wx. Qt Linguist, the translation tool, is user-friendly for anyone to use. The participants agreed that Qt can be merged soon and become the default release GUI after some time, and translations can be built up. They suggested merging Qt right after 0.4 is pushed.</p>
