    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on September 19, 2011 at 11:00 AM, "Luke-Jr" expresses concern about the current development model of bugfixes being done alongside improvements. He argues that code changes always have the potential to introduce new bugs, no matter how careful anyone is and that staying on top of bugfixes could result in the introduction of new bugs. "Luke-Jr" suggests that having a stable version would be a good idea, citing his use of version 0.3.19 with some modifications. He believes that none of the bugfixes after this version help him much, and he doesn't need any of the new features. He also considers starting an unofficial stable version with his modifications to 0.3.19 and some backported bugfixes.</p>
