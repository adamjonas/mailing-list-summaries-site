    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke-Jr asked if it is impossible to be triggered by a peer having some huge number of blocks than you. It was suggested that a global flag be created to indicate when the node thinks it is current with the network. This would also have other UI impacts such as notifying the user if their connectivity looks non-current. The node should only enforce this check when it believes it is current. The currency could be determined by height, last checkpoint, top timestamp and a safe amount. The safe amount should be high enough so it is unlikely to be falsely triggered by an improbable long gap.</p>
