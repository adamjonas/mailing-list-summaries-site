    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation in 2011, Mike Hearn discussed the possibility of writing a patch for Bitcoin with his correspondent. However, the correspondent suggested that it would be more useful to focus on addressing root issues within the network, such as nodes being able to gauge their own suitability before becoming advertised listeners. Additionally, they suggested that network simulations be set up to validate proposed changes, as spouting endless ideas without a way to measure them is not helpful. They also noted that testing on the real network is important but difficult due to its slow upgrade process, while testnet is far too small and unlike the real network to provide useful results.</p>
