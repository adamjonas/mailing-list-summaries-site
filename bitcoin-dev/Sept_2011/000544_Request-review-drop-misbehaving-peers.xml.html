    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The mailing list conversation discussed the potential DoS attacks on non-standard transactions. If there are no rules around what transactions can be sent, an attacker can get around the existing DoS rules. The discussion also touched upon the challenges of dealing with new standard transaction types that could lead to DoS attacks. There are two significant DoS attacks that could use transactions not included in blocks. One is to exhaust memory by filling up the transaction memory pool and another is to waste CPU time validating transactions. However, the code already refuses to relay non-standard transactions and drops transactions with too few fees before checking signatures or doing other CPU-intensive work. Therefore, no DoS check is required for these types of transactions, and it would be harmful when transaction fee rules change. Bandwidth DoS attacks were not discussed. Gregory's comment was added as a reminder in the code.</p>
