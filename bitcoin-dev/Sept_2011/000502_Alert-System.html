    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list are discussing the alert system used within Bitcoin. Will suggests that all messages should be relayed by the alert system regardless of the key used to prevent certain clients from receiving special treatment. However, Christian points out that relaying everything has the potential to cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Will suggests requiring a proof-of-work but Christian disagrees as it would take too long to issue an alert. Instead, they agree to keep the alert system in place and relay alert messages even if they don't use the correct key. This means that older clients will still relay these alerts if new keys are added to the alert root trust. Will proposes extending the alert system with a mechanism to sign other certificates, giving alternative client developers the ability to issue their own alerts. The email ends with a link to an article about next-generation virtual desktops for mid-market businesses.</p>
