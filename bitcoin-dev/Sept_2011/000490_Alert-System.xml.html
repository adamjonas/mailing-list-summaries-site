    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion occurred between David Perry and Steve regarding the ability to send alerts in the Bitcoin network. David raised a valid point about whether anyone other than Satoshi has the capability to send such alerts and suggested giving this privilege to current developers. He emphasized that if Satoshi's key had been compromised, a malicious source could send authoritative-looking alerts. However, it was mentioned that Satoshi had transferred his key to Gavin before leaving. Pieter agreed with David's suggestion and added that the alert system could also be used to ask people to upgrade to recent versions of the client when necessary. There may come a moment when the alert system needs to be used for that purpose.</p>
