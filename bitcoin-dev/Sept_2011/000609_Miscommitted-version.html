    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In September 2011, Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr had a discussion about the version number for the next stable release of Bitcoin. Luke-Jr had bumped the version to 0.4.1, but Jeff Garzik pointed out that the most recent release was actually 0.4.0 and any stable version based off it would be 0.4.0.1. Gavin had also previously stated that the next version after 0.4.0 would be 0.5, which is why the commit to bump the version to 0.4.1 was a surprise. Jeff Garzik was trying to clarify what version number to use for the stable release, while also ensuring that the "upstream must have merged this fix first" rule was being followed.</p>
