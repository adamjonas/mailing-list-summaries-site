    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on September 11, 2011, John Smith and Alex Waters discussed the implementation of qt in bitcoin-qt. John asked for help in identifying potential issues that could arise from the implementation, stating that he needed substantial evidence before acknowledging a pull request. Alex responded by pointing out that the thread on the bitcointalk forum was "substantial evidence" that many people were using it, as well as the number of followers on Github. He also suggested keeping bitcoin-qt as a parallel, experimental release to get more testing from those who couldn't or didn't want to build from source. Alex believed that merging the implementation as experimental would save a lot of GUI complaints on the forum about things he had implemented months ago. However, he stated that he would only put up a pull request if it was clear that the implementation would actually be integrated as it would be too much work for him to keep the pull request up-to-date if it lingered for months like many others have.</p>
