    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on September 26, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote about the validity of transactions with "non-standard" signature operation counts. The code checks for the number of SigOps in a transaction to avoid denial-of-service attacks and will reject transactions that have more than one SigOp per 34 bytes. Although it is currently allowed in blocks, Gavin was having trouble imagining a scenario in which there would be more than one SigOp per 34 bytes. However, he acknowledged that it is presently valid and should not be punished. Regarding the issue of nodes banning each other, Gavin explained that if a node has 99 blocks since the coinbase, and another person has 100 and wants to spend, it is proper to reject their transaction until the next block is obtained. However, it does not make sense to punish them for it unless they are on a blockchain fork of more than 99 blocks, in which case the DoS code should kick in and remove either them or the node from the network.</p>
