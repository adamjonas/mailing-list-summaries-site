        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed solutions to prevent timejacking and other related exploits against the Bitcoin network. One solution would change the timestamp value of multiple-of-2016 blocks to be equal to the highest timestamp that occurred in the previous 11 blocks, instead of the current time, to always obey previous rules and prevent an attacker from introducing a time lapse between the 2015-block windows. Another solution would incorporate an NTP library or remove the Bitcoin mining code from the client but require pools and miners to have accurate-to-within-a-minute system clocks, with blocks being discouraged otherwise.Aidan Thornton expressed concern about the potential harm to miners who adopted a scheme that increased the odds of the next block they mined becoming invalid, suggesting delaying the forwarding of such blocks and extending them one more time, which puts miners at risk if they don't follow the policy. However, he also agreed with fixing the root cause of the problem, even though it forks the chain. Gregory Maxwell suggested allowing a short interval instead of a fixed value for the multiple-of-2016 blocks. Chris stated that the security of the protocol should come first before individual players, and problems pool operators encounter are likely those of a potential attacker who attempts to accumulate 50%+ of the network power. Vladimir supported requiring miners to have accurate-to-within-a-minute system clocks. JS believed incorporating NTP was overkill and suggested most OSes come with NTP support integrated these days.In another discussion, Pieter Wuille suggests allowing short intervals for multiple-of-2016 blocks instead of fixed values, and Luke-Jr reminds that there is already a short interval allowed for blocks in general but only in chains where no timejacking attack is going on.Gavin Andresen discusses two fundamental problems with the cryptocurrency: Bitcoin should overlap the ranges of block timestamps it uses to calculate difficulty adjustments, and Bitcoin's "what time is it" code is considered a hack. Andresen suggests fixing the second issue by incorporating an NTP library and/or removing the Bitcoin mining code from the client but requiring miners to have accurate-to-within-a-minute system clocks. A miner in the forum supports the second solution because most miners are already running ntpd, and those who mess with the clock intentionally will have to play ball. A user called JS suggests that requiring accurate time for miners seems reasonable and incorporating NTP seems overkill since most OSes come with NTP support integrated these days.Gavin Andresen proposes modifying the getwork code to build on the second-from-tip block if the first-on-tip block is on the discouraged list, which could squash any incentive for cartels to try to start playing with difficulty. Assuming a majority of pools/miners adopt the "discourage blocks with stale timestamps" rule, this should squash any incentive for cartels to try to manipulate the difficulty. Another solution suggested by Luke-Jr is to delay the forwarding of blocks that are on the discouraged list and those that extend them. Gavin also mentions that fixing the timestamp issue may cause problems for at least one pool operator, but believes that more security should be prioritized over individual players.Lastly, Gavin mentions that fixing the root cause with a forking change may be too high risk for too little benefit. He suggests that it should only be done when there is a compelling reason to introduce a forking change, such as removing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE limit.Alex Waters suggests bundling potential future blockchain-splitting changes to implement them in a major release down the road or saving them until they are very necessary. Periodic upgrades are necessary for general network health and user security, and old versions stopping working would be a good thing at this point in bitcoin's existence, according to the high number of pre-.24 listeners still reported. Gregory Maxwell believes that general network health and user security require periodic upgrades and that backward-compatibility is a selling point for Bitcoin.The context involves various discussions on Bitcoin development, including periodic upgrades and backward-compatibility. The code is solid enough that even 2-year-old clients are still working, which is considered a real selling point for Bitcoin. There is also a discussion on changing the time rules for multiple-of-2016 blocks and its potential impact on pools and miners.</p>
