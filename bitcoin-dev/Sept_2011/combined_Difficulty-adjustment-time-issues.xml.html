    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed a solution to prevent an attacker from introducing a time lapse in between the 2015-block windows by setting the timestamp value of multiple-of-2016-blocks equal to the highest timestamp that occurred in the previous 11 blocks instead of the current time. This proposal was intended to obey the previous rules while preventing attacks. The idea is to roll out software that only uses this new rule for block creation at first but doesn't enforce it until enough miners have upgraded. Once enough miners have upgraded, choose a point in the future where it becomes mandatory causing a block chain split only for those creating blocks using old software. One problem with this solution is that it prevents X-Roll-Time for miners. Therefore, a short interval (1 minute? 10 minutes?) instead of a fixed value could be allowed for the multiple-of-2016 blocks. Luke-Jr added that fixing the root cause even though it forks the chain is better than not fixing it because it makes the bitcoin security model harder to explain and analyze. Pieter Wuille, on Mon, Nov 07, 2011, updated the proposed rule by limiting the timestamp of multiple-of-2016-blocks to [max(past 11 timestamps)+1 ... current_time+7200], just using a maximum instead of a median as he believed it would be enough to prevent the attack. Alex Waters suggested bundling potential future blockchain-splitting changes to implement them in a major release down the road or save them for when they are very necessary. However, Pieter Wuille was generally opposed to doing "too much" at once in this kind of change. Moreover, the longer we go between such changes, the more the cost is perceived to be infinite. Better to take one per year, with six months of gap between implementation, and give everyone the right expectations than to have prolonged arguments due to our inexperience that only get trumped by emergency changes. The general network health and user security require periodic upgrades in any case, and will for the foreseeable future.</p>
