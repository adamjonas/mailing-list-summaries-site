    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, Gavin Andresen provided background on timejacking and a related exploit against low-difficulty alternative chains. Pieter Wuille suggested an alternative solution to prevent attackers from introducing a time lapse in between 2015-block windows. The proposal would keep all network rules as they are now, but the timestamp value of multiple-of-2016 blocks would be set equal to the highest timestamp that occurred in the previous 11 blocks, instead of the current time. Roll out software would initially use this new rule for block creation but not enforce it until enough miners have upgraded, at which point it becomes mandatory and causes a blockchain split for those using old software. Luke-Jr suggested limiting the timestamp of multiple-of-2016 blocks to [max(past 11 timestamps)+1 ... current_time+7200], essentially just using a maximum instead of a median, to prevent the attack. Alex Waters proposed bundling these changes for implementation in a major release down the road. Aidan Thornton pointed out that if only a small percentage of mining power adopts the scheme, they could harm themselves since they are increasing the odds that the next block they mine will become invalid. Another suggestion was to delay forwarding of these blocks and blocks that extend them until extended one more time, putting miners at risk if they don't run the augmented extension policy. Finally, it was agreed that the root cause should be fixed to ensure the system is secure against this kind of attack.</p>
