    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on September 14, 2011 at 10:45:36 AM, Gavin Andresen addressed the issue of block timestamp rules and the potential for a chain split if they were changed. According to Andresen, the current rules allow for hours of wiggle-room for timestamps, which is not enough to cause any problems. However, the issue arises when these rules are not enforced. Andresen proposed that if a majority of pools/miners adopted a rule discouraging blocks with stale timestamps, this would eliminate any incentive for cartels to manipulate difficulty levels. He warned that attempting to do so would require more than 50% of power, or risk producing mostly orphan blocks. In conclusion, Andresen expressed his disapproval for adopting this rule as it goes against the interests of pools/miners and does not address any real problems.</p>
