    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker believes that effort should be focused on addressing the root issues of the network, such as having nodes determine their own suitability before becoming advertised listeners. However, determining suitability is not always straightforward, as a node may have connectivity with a peer but experience slow speeds due to link saturation.To address this, the speaker suggests two solutions: making it easy to determine latency and using that data to make better connection decisions. Adding a pong message can help solve the first issue by building latency histograms of nodes to assess network performance. This data can then be used to inform simulations of what would happen if the measurements were used by node software, allowing for experimentation with less critical software like Android clients.</p>
