    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille proposed an idea to move away from static bitcoin addresses as descriptions for transactions. He posted a Github link and hoped it could start a discussion about the topic. Wuille suggested that current addresses are only a reference to a public key, and they are used as a template for a transaction. However, he wants to standardize part of that out-of-band communication inside a protocol. Wuille believes that if a freshly negotiated key is required each time, then some form of bidirectional communication is necessary. By using a protocol instead of a static template, many possibilities open up, including transparently adding support for anything possible through bitcoin scripts. Wuille proposed a three-step approach: first, create transactions; second, ask nodes not to broadcast their transaction but instead send it back, making it easier for the receiver to track, and adding tags makes identification of transactions easier; third, add signatures to authenticate the whole process. In response to a comment by Luke-Jr, who suggested sending an email or chatting via XMPP, Wuille did not want to do that when buying something in a webshop. He suggested using an HTTP connection like the one already being used to view the static address on the website. Although deterministic key pairs remove the necessity of bidirectional communication, Wuille still believes his scheme is far more flexible and user-friendly.</p>
