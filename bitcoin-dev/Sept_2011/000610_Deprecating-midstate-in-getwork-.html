    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In September 2011, Nils Schneider proposed to simplify the internal reference miner and remove all dependencies on cryptopp since it was the only place where it wasn't using OpenSSL. However, cryptopp was being used to calculate getwork "midstate," even though this field was redundant and could be calculated from the blockheader. Schneider wanted to remove it, but he was concerned about announcing such a change so that all miners can be upgraded. Jeff Garzik replied that one of the pools might already be working on something like that. He believed it could be removed and guessed that someone had already field-tested that idea. Later, Garzik tested removing midstate himself and found out that at least one miner (cpuminer IIRC) required it.</p>
