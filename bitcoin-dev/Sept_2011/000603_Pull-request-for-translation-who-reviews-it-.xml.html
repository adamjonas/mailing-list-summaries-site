    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named David from Bitcoin.se posted a question on the forums regarding improvements to the Swedish translation of the client. However, most developers tend to ignore or treat the forums as write-only due to the abundance of junk in them. David is unsure if his request will be accepted since there aren't many people in the project who can judge the quality of the Swedish translation. The response suggests that translation updates are usually pulled blindly unless someone opposes them.The previous Swedish translations seem to have been committed by someone named Codler, but no one is responsible for translations in Bitcoin. It would be beneficial if people agreed to keep their translations up-to-date when they submit new ones. Moreover, David inquires about a list of people who have permissions to make a pull and is informed that anyone can make a pull request. Still, only Gavin, tcatm, sipa, jgarzik, and alexwaters can push to the bitcoin repo (i.e., can pull a pull request).</p>
