    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests that if one is interested in seeing how PEPs work, they can refer to <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/</a>. The author also offers to maintain a similar index if required. Python does not use Git or GitHub and therefore BEP involvement with Git needs to be reflected in 001 or transition away from it completely. The author, who has experience as a project manager with various VC systems, finds it difficult to find a good solution for the organization of the development life cycle. After examining Bitcoin for three weeks, the author believes there is a lack of willingness to implement meta changes. Although Git/GitHub is working, it's not ideal for everyone. The author's major issues with GitHub are the lack of prioritization options, voting system, and reporting/metrics. Gavin has asked the author to research how other O/S projects are doing things. The author recommends continuing with the current system but planning alternative organization voting around the time of 0.5 release. The author believes that immense structure isn't necessary until approaching 1.0 since the project is still in Beta. The PEP system is an outstanding alternative/supplement to consider. The author also requests feedback on what needs changing and how important it is.</p>
