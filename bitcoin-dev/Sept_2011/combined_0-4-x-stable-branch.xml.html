        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion thread, Gavin Andresen expressed his initial reaction to the idea of creating a stable branch for bitcoin development. He believed that maintaining two release lines won't make testing and bug-fixing any better and using the word "stable" would be dishonest until they reach a consensus on a version ready for everyone to use. The concern behind the proposal was providing a stable base bitcoind for miners, banks, and webservices to apply their patches on top of. Currently, if they want to keep up with development, they are stuck forward porting against often disruptive changes as just about everyone running something of importance needs some patch or another so you have people who are trailing development on some of their systems by many months.Luke-Jr replied that the current development model is problematic because bugfixes are done alongside improvements, and code changes always have the potential to introduce new bugs, no matter how careful anyone is. So staying on top of bugfixes right now implies risking new bugs being introduced. He further added that considering the small number of new features added, most of the more recently introduced bugs were the result of fixes not features.Gavin Andresen suggested more effort should be put into mainlining the changes people are carrying sooner and restructuring code to better accommodate patches which aren't suitable for mainline. This will also encourage people to make the fixes they're running publicly available, rather than just keeping them private for competitive advantage. He was not convinced a bugfixes only branch will help much and even bug fixes will disrupt local fixes, and testing and supervising the upgrade usually takes more effort than the forward porting.</p>
