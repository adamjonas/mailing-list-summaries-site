    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Gavin Andresen expressed his initial reaction to maintaining two release lines of Bitcoin's codebase: no. He argued that testing and bug-fixing is the bottleneck for making core bitcoin better, and having two release lines would not make that better. Andresen also stated that until they reach version "1.0" that everyone can agree is ready for everybody to use, using the word "stable" would be dishonest. Another concern addressed was providing a stable base bitcoind for miners, banks, and webservices to apply their patches on top of. Currently, they are stuck forward porting against often disruptive changes as just about everyone running something of importance needs some patch or another. Luke-Jr followed up on this issue by stating that the problem with the current development model is that bug fixes are done alongside improvements, and code changes always have the potential to introduce new bugs, no matter how careful anyone is. Staying on top of bug fixes right now implies risking new bugs being introduced. Luke-Jr argued that bug fixes also introduce bugs and that most recently introduced bugs were the result of fixes rather than features. Rather than maintaining two release lines, he proposed that more effort be put into mainlining the changes people are carrying sooner and restructuring code to better accommodate patches which aren't suitable for mainline. This will also encourage people to make the fixes they're running publicly available, rather than just keeping them private for competitive advantage.</p>
