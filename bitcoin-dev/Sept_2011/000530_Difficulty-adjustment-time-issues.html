    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Alex Waters and Gavin Andresen, the topic of implementing a forking change was brought up. Gavin expressed concern over the high risk involved in introducing such a change without a compelling reason. Alex suggested bundling this and potential future blockchain-splitting changes to implement them in a major release down the road or saving them until they are very necessary. Alex believes that doing "too much" at once can be problematic, with some changes being more controversial than others. He suggests taking one change per year, with six months of gap between implementation, to give everyone the right expectations and avoid prolonged arguments due to inexperience. Periodic upgrades are necessary for general network health and user security, and old versions stopping working would be a good thing at this point in bitcoin's existence, according to the high number of pre-.24 listeners still reported.</p>
