    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the world of Bitcoin, has proposed that bitcoin.org should become a platform for developers to exchange ideas about the direction of Bitcoin. He believes that this change will ensure Bitcoin's eventual success by serving as a neutral platform for discussions. Andresen has set up a process for proposing changes to the Bitcoin protocol and has marked the first proposal as a draft. The proposal BEP 0001 is copied from Python's PEP 0001 and serves as a starting point for discussion. Andresen suggests that long discussions should be favored over voting, citing Wikipedia's model for resolving issues. He believes it to be superior to Debian with a cycling board of voting members. Andresen looks to bittorrent.org as a good future ideal to model themselves off of, along with their EP pages. BEP 0001 needs review and comments, but bittorrent did the exact same thing here with success, copying the PEP process. This move would make it easier to choose among various Bitcoin implementations.</p>
