    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In order to avoid confusion and repetition, it is suggested that the discussion be kept on a single mailing list. The presence of duplicate threads in different places can lead to redundancy and people making the same points again and again. The discussion in question was intended to be posted on the c developers' list, but for the sake of getting more responses, the author also put it up in another forum. However, to streamline the discussion, it has been decided to move it to the bitcoinj list. For those who are interested in following the conversation, the link to the other list has been provided.</p>
