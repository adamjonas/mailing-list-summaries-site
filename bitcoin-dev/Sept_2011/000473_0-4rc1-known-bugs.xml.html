    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Detective Wuille was praised for his successful patch for the deadlock issue in Bitcoin's code. The patch can be found on GitHub and uses a different approach than the one suggested by Pieter to fix the cs_mapaddresses deadlock. Detective Wuille performed the database operation after releasing the deadlock and tested it using start/stop/restart stress test, which proved successful. He also reviewed all the places in the code that initiates a database transaction, ensuring that there were no similar issues. Regarding improving DEBUG_LOCKORDER, Pieter suggested adding a rule that ignores critical sections that are only locked through TRY_...? Gavin Andresen highlighted a deadlock between the addr-handling and IRC-join-handling code, while Pieter pointed out that DB internally uses pthreads to implement the txn_begin()/commit() scheme, which needs to be taken into account when searching for deadlocks but is not detected by DEBUG_LOCKORDER.</p>
