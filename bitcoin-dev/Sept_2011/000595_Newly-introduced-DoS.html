    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Luke-Jr and Gavin Andresen, a prominent developer of bitcoin, was about the DoS (Denial of Service) rules in bitcoin. Luke-Jr had suggested that two errors, "AcceptToMemoryPool() : transaction with out-of-bounds SigOpCount" and "ConnectInputs() : tried to spend coinbase at depth %d", should not be DoS'd. Gavin disagreed, stating that if nodes legitimately relay such transactions/blocks, then it would open a new DoS. In response, Gavin explained that if a scheduled block-chain-split is made, denying service to nodes running old, obsolete versions of bitcoin is the right thing to do. Finally, Gavin remarked on the third DoS in AcceptBlock(): prev block not found -- which he considers a should-be-impossible case since AcceptBlock is only called when extending the best-block chain.</p>
