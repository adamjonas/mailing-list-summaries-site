    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum discussion, Chris expressed their belief that putting pools at a disadvantage is actually desirable for the security of the protocol. While they acknowledge their own use of pools, they argue that the priority should be the security of the network rather than individual players. The problems faced by pool operators could also apply to potential attackers trying to accumulate 50% or more of the network power. In response to Gavin Andresen's suggestion of discouraging blocks with stale timestamps, Luke-Jr argues that this would not solve any real problems and would go against the interests of pools/miners. They also note that changing the block timestamp rules could risk causing a chain split. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
