    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list discussion, it was suggested that duplicate threads in different places should be avoided to prevent confusion and repetition of points. The author proposed a simple approach to address version skew by disconnecting older clients and not sending received transactions/blocks to the bitcoind. Instead, the bitcoind will hear about them from its own p2p connections, allowing for the reception of all valid transactions/blocks that can be relayed, cached, or have inbound duplicates dropped. To handle inv/getblocks/getheaders requests, the proxy can parse and handle them so that clients connecting and catching up with the chain don't place any load on the bitcoind. If a client requests data that the proxy doesn't have in RAM, it can fetch it from the underlying bitcoind. The author suggests starting with this simple approach first and then improving upon it in v2 if scalability improvements are demonstrated in v1.</p>
