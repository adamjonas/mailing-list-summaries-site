        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Emil Engler, a member of the Bitcoin Developer mailing list, has proposed the idea of regularly resetting the testnet. The proposal involves using every 210,000 block as the genesis of a completely new chain and forgetting the old one, making it impossible for any chain to be longer than 210,000 blocks. However, there are concerns about implementing this idea, such as how to get it working with testnet3, which may require a hardfork, and whether it would be easy to change the chain while Bitcoin Core is running. Additionally, there may be concerns about planned attacks causing the chain to derive into multiple ones at every reset. Emil is seeking feedback on the idea.The topic of resetting the testnet was previously discussed in June 2019 and received feedback. Recently, new information regarding signet, an alternative to testnet, was shared in the email. The links to all the previous discussions and new material were provided in the email.Overall, Emil is considering writing a BIP about resetting the testnet on a regular or scheduled basis and is seeking feedback on the idea. While there are some concerns about implementation and potential attacks, the proposal could have benefits for testing and development purposes.</p>
