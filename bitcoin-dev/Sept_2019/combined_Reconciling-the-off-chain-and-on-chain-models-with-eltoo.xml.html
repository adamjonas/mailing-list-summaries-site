        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>of multi-party eltoo based 'signet' with different transaction validation and block creation logic. They propose a new message where channel parties would add their signature before forwarding a valid block, and the block wouldn't be built until all parties had signed. The discussion also revolves around finding solutions to the challenges that arise in multi-party off-chain payment mechanisms, including uncooperative membership change, privacy, liveness, and fees for each update. To address these challenges, different approaches were suggested, such as using escape hatch in scripts to spend any output attached to the settlement transaction by n-1 participants, creating a new mechanism within the mechanism layer, and using Tor for disassociating IP addresses from signers. Furthermore, ZmnSCPxj proposed ideas for cooperative and uncooperative closing of channels, membership changes, mining rewards, privacy, and liveness in multi-party off-chain payment mechanisms. In terms of cooperative close, parties mutually agree to finalize the outputs from the most recent channel output state with low on-chain fees. The closing of an outer mechanism does not require the close of any hosted update mechanisms. However, splicing out uncooperative members through a channel splicing transaction is currently considered unsafe. To address liveness issues, signers can pre-sign updates committing their own outputs or have contingent tap-leafs to splice out non-responsive signers.There was also a discussion about the advantages of using transactions as a means to represent off-chain negotiations and applying them to the off-chain state via cut-through, allowing for experimentation even inside a running eltoo instance. This idea was further elaborated by Christian, who believes that building a nicely layered protocol stack that improves flexibility and simplifies the reasoning about their relative security is achievable using the properties of eltoo. The email also discussed the concept of transaction cut-through and how offchain systems can be considered a specialization of this. The use of eltoo update scheme to consolidate blocks of off-chain transactions is an interesting idea which ZmnSCPxj has some limitations on. Despite this, it still offers compelling advantages over LN-Penalty for multiple party channels and commonly used types of scripts. In conclusion, the discussions revolve around finding solutions to the challenges that arise in multi-party off-chain payment mechanisms, including uncooperative membership change, privacy, liveness, and fees for each update. Different approaches were suggested, such as using escape hatch in scripts, creating a new mechanism within the mechanism layer, and using Tor for disassociating IP addresses from signers. Furthermore, there was a proposal to design an off-chain protocol for managing negotiations and imagine a sort of multi-party eltoo based 'signet' with different transaction validation and block creation logic. The use of transactions as a means to represent off-chain negotiations and applying them to the off-chain state via cut-through was also discussed.</p>
