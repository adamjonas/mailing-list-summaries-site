    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A draft of the new BIP, which outlines low-level specifications for a reconciliation-based transaction announcement protocol, is now open for review. The proposed spec includes salted short transaction IDs necessary for efficient reconciliation and demonstrates how to compute sketches based on these IDs using simple Python scripts. Furthermore, it introduces wtxid-based truncated transaction IDs that can save a significant fraction of bandwidth.Agreeing on this specification would allow for the integration of more bandwidth-efficient relay protocols, such as Erlay. However, to prevent transmitting duplicate transactions, an extra round has been added where two parties explicitly map 32-bit short IDs to 128-bit truncated IDs. The draft provides all the necessary background information to understand the proposed work. It also specifies all the messages required for an efficient reconciliation-based protocol, along with new state variables necessary for the protocol's operation. Interested parties are encouraged to read and review the draft thoroughly. The proposed specification has the potential to significantly improve efficiency in transaction announcement protocols, making it an important development for the cryptocurrency community.</p>
