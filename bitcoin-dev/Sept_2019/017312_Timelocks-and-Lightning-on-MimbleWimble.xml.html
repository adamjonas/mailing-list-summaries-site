    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>MimbleWimble, a blockchain protocol that allows for privacy and scalability, may not be able to incorporate offchain protocols like Lightning network while retaining its "magical shrinking blockchain" property. However, relative lock heights can be easily included in MimbleWimble, as demonstrated by Grin and Beam. Both have implemented absolute lock heights since launch, with Grin proposing relative lock heights and designing payment channels based on them. Beam recently included relative lock heights in its HardFork and has a payment channel design as well. The links to the relevant proposals and designs are provided in the context above.</p>
