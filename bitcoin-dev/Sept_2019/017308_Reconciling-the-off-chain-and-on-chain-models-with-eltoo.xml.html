    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the challenges that arise in multi-party off-chain mechanisms such as Lightning Network. The issues discussed are uncooperative membership change, fees for each update, privacy, and liveness. The participants suggest different solutions to overcome these problems. They discuss using an escape hatch in scripts to spend any output attached to the settlement transaction by n-1 participants, creating a new mechanism within the mechanism layer, and playing a game where each participant creates two updates with the same state number at each update. These updates will keep them in the contract, while the fallback splice all outputs they own (direct ones, HTLCs) and put the rest back into a channel without them. One of the key points made is that there is no direct relationship between the ownership of an output and the ID signing off on a change. They also suggest using Tor for disassociating IP addresses from signers and including some kind of mix mechanism to allow individual signers to disassociate their ownership of funds from their identity as signers.</p>
