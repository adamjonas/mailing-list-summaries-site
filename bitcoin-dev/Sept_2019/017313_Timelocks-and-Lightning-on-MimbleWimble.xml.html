    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation discussing the possibility of offchain protocols on MimbleWimble, ZmnSCPxj expresses that he believes it is not possible while still retaining its "magical shrinking blockchain" property. However, he acknowledges that relative lock heights can be incorporated into MimbleWimble and provides links to Grin and Beam, which have included them since launch. ZmnSCPxj notes that kernels with relative locktimes are not pruneable and will contribute to blockchain size, but still believes it is worth accepting this cost in exchange for being able to layer on top of a MimbleWimble blockchain. He also suggests that Poon-Dryja and Decker-Wattenhofer can be ported over to any MimbleWimble blockchain with relative locktimes, but Decker-Russell-Osuntokun ("eltoo") is harder due to the `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` requirement. Despite the loss of SCRIPT, ZmnSCPxj believes that a MimbleWimble blockchain can still use an offchain updateable cryptocurrency system.</p>
