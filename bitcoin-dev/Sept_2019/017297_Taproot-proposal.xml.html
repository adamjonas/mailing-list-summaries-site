    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the proposed Taproot softfork, which includes a number of ideas such as making all outputs and cooperative spends indistinguishable, using Merkle branches to hide unexecuted branches in scripts, and enabling wallet software to use key aggregation/thresholds within one input. The proposal also includes improvements to the signature hashing algorithm, replacing OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY) with OP_CHECKSIGADD, and extensibility through leaf versions, OP_SUCCESS opcodes, and upgradable pubkey types. The BIP drafts can be found on GitHub, along with an initial reference implementation of the consensus changes. The email also discusses different options for setting y signs for P and Q in a Taproot output and suggests not supporting P2SH-nested TR. The author explains that most wallets/exchanges/services now support sending to native segwit addresses, and this will likely be even more true if Schnorr/Taproot activate in 12+ months time. The author echoes agreement with John Newbery's preference to not support P2SH-nested TR, stating that there is still plenty of time to have ecosystem upgrade by the time taproot is likely to activate.</p>
