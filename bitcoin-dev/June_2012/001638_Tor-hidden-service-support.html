    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Phatom project has reused the fd87:d87e:eb43::/48 IPv6 range to map each address in an 80-bit range to an onion address and treated as belonging to a separate network. This network range is the same as used by OnionCat application but not used in any way. Other clients can use this test case: 5wyqrzbvrdsumnok.onion == FD87:D87E:EB43:edb1:8e4:3588:e546:35ca, which means decoding the base32 onion address and storing the resulting 80 bits of data as low-order bits of an IPv6 address, prefixed by fd87:d87e:eb43:. As this range is not routable, there should be no compatibility problems.Furthermore, the Phantom project has also provided blocks for other similar projects including fd00:2522:3493::/48 and fd60:db4d:ddb5::/48 for garlicat on I2P. Although these blocks are not expected to be routable, some people may have interfaces, routing tables, and packet filters on their machines configured with up to all three networks for the purposes therein.</p>
