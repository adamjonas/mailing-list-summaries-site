    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the Bitcoin protocol and its implementation. The first message suggests that the BitTorrent model, with its capability-based extension system, could be a useful example for the Bitcoin protocol to follow. This could involve trying out new algorithms, adding new features, and reverting protocol changes if necessary. The problem with implementing the Bitcoin protocol is not the protocol itself, but the fact that changes to it can happen suddenly without proper consideration or reflection. However, the author does not intend to slow down progress and tries to hedge against conservatism. The second message highlights the complexity of the current P2P protocol in Bitcoin and the challenges faced by developers maintaining non-Satoshi codebases. The lack of documentation on the wiki makes it difficult to reference and implement. The P2P protocol is already filled with magic numbers and arbitrarily versioned binary data structures, making it a potentially buggy and insecure zoo of complicated interactions. The author posits that incremental protocol versions with clear requirements could be a better solution than the current extension system.</p>
