    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Andy Parkins and Wladimir discuss the potential introduction of state in Bitcoin and the need for a capabilities command. Wladimir expresses concern over the possibility of a complicated and potentially insecure protocol with the introduction of various clients. He suggests standardizing what a 'thin client' and what a 'thick client' does and offers at a certain version level to make it easier to deprecate certain features later on. While letting nodes know each other's capabilities at connection time would help, he questions the benefits compared to incremental protocol versions with clear requirements. He also proposes that if a capability system is implemented, the granularity should be large rather than command-level and the interaction between protocol versions and capabilities needs to be defined.</p>
