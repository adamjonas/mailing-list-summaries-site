        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On June 15, 2012, Peter Vessenes, the CEO of CoinLab, proposed the idea of removing the GUI from the Satoshi client and implementing data requests as RPC calls instead. The goal behind this suggestion was to enable forking QT and other GUIs and simplify the codebase. However, it was noted that the current RPC calls were not sufficient to implement a fully-featured and responsive UI. Wladimir, a member of the community, questioned the need for splitting the project, emphasizing that the UI plays a crucial role in driving requirements on the core. Therefore, he argued that the UI should remain a first-class citizen. Despite this, Peter J. Vessenes sought input and thoughts from others in the community regarding this proposal.</p>
