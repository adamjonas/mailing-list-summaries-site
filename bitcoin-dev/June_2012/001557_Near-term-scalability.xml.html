    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message thread dated June 15, 2012, talks about scalability issues and the impact of forcing users to switch addresses per received payment. The author argues that users should have more control over their technology, and a say in how Bitcoin operates. Instead of imposing hard and fast rules, it is essential to present choices and inform users to make good decisions with a social component of the users operating the network.Satoshi did not anticipate the growth of the network, and the block reward subsidy is too high. Transactions can afford to be cheap, but what would happen if blocks required a cumulative fee of XN BTC for N transactions before being accepted? The use case of accepting donations does not need fast confirmations. There are no artificial barriers to entry beyond the base cost, and the Bitcoin network would always be competitive and strictly operate based on market dynamics.</p>
