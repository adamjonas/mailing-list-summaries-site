    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on June 26, 2012, grarpamp suggested to include the block of the Phatom project for people who use overlay networks that are routable but use private space. There was a suggestion to add blocks to the IsRoutable check as well. It was noted that while these blocks may not be expected to be routable, people may still have interfaces, routing tables and packet filters on their machines configured with up to all three of those networks for the purposes therein. The hidden service support in Bitcoin uses a compatible IPv6 mapping with Onioncat, although it is not Onioncat, does not use Onioncat, does not need Onioncat, and wouldn't benefit from Onioncat. The Onioncat style advertisement is used because the protocol already relays IPv6 addresses. The connections are regular tor hidden service connections, not the more-risky and low performance ip in tcp onioncat stuff.</p>
