        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The CEO of CoinLab, Peter J. Vessenes, has been considering the possibility of removing the GUI from the Satoshi client and reimplementing data requests as RPC calls to enable forking QT and other GUIs and simplify the codebase. This idea was brought up on June 15, 2012, with the aim of speeding up development. However, the current RPC calls are not sufficient for a full-featured UI implementation. JSON-RPC does not support bidirectional communication without ugly hacks. Peter is seeking input and thoughts from others in the community regarding this change. The splitting of the UI into a separate process is a long-term goal, but Wladimir questioned the need to split the project, stating that the UI is one of the drivers for requirements on the core, and it should remain a first-class citizen. Despite this, Peter believes that this could be a big win and wants to find ways to speed up development.</p>
