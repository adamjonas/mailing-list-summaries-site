        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Miners are facing issues with block propagation due to the time it takes, which can be up to several minutes. This is because validating blocks before relaying them is IO intensive and can take up to a minute alone on slow nodes with large blocks. This creates a risk of mismatched incentives where miners may choose not to mine many transactions in order to maximize their income. However, there is a short-term improvement that can be made at the protocol level by making it possible to relay blocks to other nodes before fully validating them. Basic validation can be done first, making this change still secure.Luke-jr has been working on a patch for this improvement, which includes the use of a new message for preview-blocks instead of just announcing them like normal. This will prevent existing full nodes from blacklisting nodes sending a bad preview block due to existing misbehavior checks. Additionally, SPV nodes can opt-out or at least know that the data is not yet validated by the peer. Even after other performance improvements are made, this change would still be beneficial.While there may be other contributing factors to the issue, this change is one of the most obvious solutions to improve block propagation for miners.</p>
