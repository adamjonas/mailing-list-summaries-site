    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Tor-talk, the topic of conflicts was brought up. The poster mentions that they had previously provided an answer to this question in a reply on Tor-talk which is currently awaiting moderation due to bcc. They then provide some information pertaining to seednodes on Tor/I2P and suggest including the block of the Phantom project in the IsRoutable check. The poster goes on to explain that Bitcoin would not be able to offload traffic to any local blocks or specific hosts on them if set up via Cat or Phantom. This would only affect Bitcoin and not other programs running on them. They also provide links to the Phantom project for reference.</p>
