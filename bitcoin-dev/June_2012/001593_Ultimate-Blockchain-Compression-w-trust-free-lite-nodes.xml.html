    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>DiThi, a user on the Bitcoin.it wiki, expressed interest in implementing an idea for Bitcoin blockchain compression. In response to this, Peter Todd commented on Alan Reiner's Bitcointalk post regarding the same topic. Reiner's proposal suggests using a tree data structure to organize all unspent-TxOuts on the network. The root of this tree would communicate its "signature" between nodes, while the leaves of this tree would correspond to addresses/scripts. The data at the leaf is actually a root of the unspent-TxOut list for that address/script. To maintain security of the tree signatures, it will be included in the header of an alternate blockchain, which will be secured by merged mining. Todd questions how people can prevent others from deliberately unbalancing the tree with addresses with chosen hashes. He proposes a new rule stating that any *new* address whose hash happens to be deeper in the tree than, say, 10*log(n), indicating it was probably chosen to be unbalanced, gets discarded. This rule would only affect those playing games and would not impact unrelated people. Todd also mentions that with the popularity of firstbits, it may be a good idea to use a comparison function that works last bit first.</p>
