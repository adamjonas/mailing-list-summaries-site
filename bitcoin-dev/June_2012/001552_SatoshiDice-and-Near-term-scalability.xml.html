    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Stefan Thomas on June 15, 2012, they discussed the possibility of changing the block size limit for Bitcoin. Garzik notes that this is a hard-fork item and requires a high level of community buy-in since it would shut out older clients who refuse to consider blocks larger than 1MB as valid. The likelihood of the block size limit increasing in the short term is low because it is considered a "nuclear option." Garzik asks for good, hard data indicating whether SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of other network traffic, as anything approaching that level of change would require justification. He acknowledges that while SatoshiDice is a heavy user of the network, there is a significant difference between a good stress test and a network flood that shuts out non-SD users. Thus, Garzik requests quantification of the situation.</p>
