        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In June 2012, Mike Hearn sent an email to Gavin Andresen asking for some decisions regarding moving away from BDB. He mentioned the issues with the system such as it being tied to a database environment and people wanting to copy files between systems. Additionally, it provides consistency in case of failures but because old log files are removed, corrupted systems are still seen frequently. Hence, he suggested using LevelDB, assuming that it would be an improvement in these areas and also result in speed improvement. However, there were concerns raised about LevelDB being obscure, new, having a minimalist build system, and not being very large. There were also questions about its portability, testing, and compatibility guarantees. Despite this, including the source code didn't seem to be problematic. There was also a discussion about whether other tweaks could be made to the db format at the same time since the format would change and a slow migration period would be necessary. Jeff had been working on splitting the database into several files earlier, and Pieter was working on the database/validation logic. Each of these would require a rebuild of the databases anyway. It was suggested that they should try to get them in a single release so that people only need to rebuild once. Finally, there was a reference to a conversation in which Satoshi's code used ordered access/iteration in one place, where it looked up the "owner transactions" of a tx. It was suggested that it may have predated the wallet logic and apparently wasn't used anywhere in the code.</p>
