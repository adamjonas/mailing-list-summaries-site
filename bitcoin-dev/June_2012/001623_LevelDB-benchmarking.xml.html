    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent development on the #bitcoin-dev platform, it was discovered that the CTxDB::ReadOwnerTxes code has never been used in the Bitcoin codebase. The conversation started as someone asked what the code was ever used for and another member suggested that it may have predated the wallet logic. However, it was concluded that the code is not used anywhere in the current codebase, even in version 0.1.5. As a result, it was decided that the code will be deleted during the next patch update by Stefan.</p>
