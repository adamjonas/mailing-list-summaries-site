    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker expresses gratitude for the information that BitcoinJS uses LevelDB. However, they point out that LevelDB was originally designed for servers and comes from BigTable. Although it is currently used in Chrome, the design did not stem from there. The speaker notes that the design may become less optimal for desktops and laptops over time as SSDs are becoming more prevalent, and the minimal-seeks design of LevelDB is not necessarily helpful. The speaker anticipates that most Bitcoin nodes on servers will continue to be HDD based for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the speaker mentions that Satoshis code does use ordered access/iteration in at least one place, where it looks up the "owner transactions" of a tx. However, the speaker is unsure of what the code is used for and questions whether it is actually the best way to solve the problem.</p>
