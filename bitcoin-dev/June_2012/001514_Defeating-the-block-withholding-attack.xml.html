    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Mike Koss is asking for more details about a proposal that was made. Specifically, he is seeking clarification on how the proposal will work for decentralized pools and what the new block header would look like. The proposed block header includes the block version number, hash of the previous block, share difficulty, timestamp, current target in compact format, and nonce. To earn a share, the final bits of the block header must be zero. For a block to be valid and added to the blockchain, the hash of the block header, concatenated with a valid share candidate for the next block header, must hash to a value less than the current target offset against the share difficulty.Mike also seeks clarification on the meaning of "NextBlockCandidate." The concept refers to the fact that the first share becomes a block only after a second share is found that combined hashes to meet the real difficulty. That second share becomes a block when a third is found, and so on. Overall, the discussion revolves around technical aspects of mining cryptocurrency and the specific requirements for earning shares and validating blocks within the proposed system.</p>
