        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The writer of this context is experiencing difficulty with the bitcoind software, as it is not responding to various rpc queries and signals. Despite registering these actions in the debug log, they do not occur as expected. The writer suggests that the software should check for and process all user interrupts once per block while doing the chain in the background. They also question how busy commerce servers handle poor rpc handling and wonder if there is a way to increase the priority of user scheduled tasks.In a forum post from 2012, grarpamp raised similar issues with bitcoind not responding to certain rpc queries and signals. They suggested that the program should check and process all user interrupts once per block and do the chain in the background. However, Wladimir responded by explaining that this has nothing to do with priority or user interrupts but with the locks on the wallet and client. Every RPC command takes both locks, and releases them only when finished. Shutting down also requires both locks, so the operations will be serialized. This is done to protect the database and critical data structures.While there may be some cases where the locks are not necessary or read/write locks could be used instead for improved concurrency, caution must be exercised in implementing such changes. Overall, the writer is seeking an answer to what's going on with the bitcoind software and the issues related to rpc queries and signals.</p>
