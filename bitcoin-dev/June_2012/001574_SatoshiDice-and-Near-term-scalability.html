    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joseph, who runs the website SatoshiDice, is willing to cooperate and doesn't want to harm the Bitcoin network. It has been suggested that asking him to stop attaching small fees to every transaction is not the best solution. Instead, if bitcoinj can be fixed to have smarter fee codes, he may stop doing this. The issue of SatoshiDice and its effect on the scalability of Bitcoin has been raised by Jeff Garzik. A hard-fork would require a high level of community buy-in, as it would shut out older clients. Data indicating whether SatoshiDice was shutting out other traffic was requested, but no such data was presented. Jonathan Warren measures mainnet confirmation times on a regular basis, and prior to recently, fee-paying transactions never took anywhere near as long to confirm as they do now.</p>
