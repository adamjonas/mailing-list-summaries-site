    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests a solution to cases where the generator of a transaction doesn't care about confirmation times and would be willing to make their transaction lower priority than other zero-fee transactions. However, they do not support this idea as it is yet another change in network rules, which may affect some users negatively. The author also disagrees with the notion that transactions need to be "less important than free," stating that paying for the transaction is an auction like any other. They suggest implementing grouped fee calculations to maintain the property that the person who cares about double-spending risk pays the fees. The author suggests shipping a pruned snapshot with Bitcoin, which would increase its centralization. However, the author argues that as long as there is at least one copy of the old data in an accessible location, new nodes can still bootstrap just fine. The only case where it might cause issues is if you install a fresh copy of a very old node, but those nodes could be made to announce more frequently than normal if needed.</p>
