    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, grarpamp is seeking clarity on the workflow of development in the context of Github and the stable repository. The workflow consists of new development taking place in master during release windows. Once the windows close, master is cleaned up and bug-fixed for the next 0.x release. If there are issues with 0.N.0 before the next release window opens, it can be used to roll a 0.N.1 (and recently even a 0.N.2 and 0.N.2.2). Once the release window for the next 0.N version opens, the last bugfix-only commit after the final 0.N.M release made in master is imported into the stable repository as the 0.N.x branch, and backports are applied. When there are significant backports, another 0.N.M tag is placed from the branch, and potentially Windows binaries are released. However, grarpamp brings up a particular example of release tarballs on SourceForge that have tags in Github but no tags in Gitorious. While there are no 'x' branches on Github, there is one release applicable branch on Gitorious. As hinted by Luke that Gitorious has the stable trees, grarpamp expects to see release tags laid down at some point in time on the 'x' stable branches. However, there are no such tags. Luke realizes that he has been neglecting to update the stable repo with releases tagged in master and fixes the issue.</p>
