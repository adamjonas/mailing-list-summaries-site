    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Mike Hearn and another individual are discussing the potential benefits of combining two protocols. The other individual suggests that the separation of the protocols allows the scanning node to determine how much effort it wants to put into each transaction on behalf of the SPV client. However, Mike believes the negotiation protocol also needs to be specified. He suggests that nodes can request a filter using filterinit by specifying the false positive rate it wants and the number of items it expects. The node that holds the filter will then respond with the closest filter it is willing to provide. If the SPV node agrees to the filter offered, it will respond with a filterload command. Otherwise, it will disconnect and find another full node. Mike argues that overloaded nodes should offer 50% fp rate filters as an option if there aren't many full nodes available instead of simply disconnecting SPV clients. Overall, while the benefits of combining the protocols are debated, the negotiation protocol for requesting filters is already in place.</p>
