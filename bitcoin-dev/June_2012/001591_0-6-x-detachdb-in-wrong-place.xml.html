    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There seems to be confusion regarding the difference and usage of two Bitcoin repositories, one on GitHub and the other on Gitorious. It is unclear which repository contains formal releases that are tagged and cut into .tbz files. Additionally, it is unknown which repository has branches with commits that will be included in the next formal release, such as those tracking along 0.5.x, 0.6.x, HEAD/master (to be branched for 0.7.x). The user notes that there appear to be more tags in the GitHub repository, while the Gitorious repository seems to have more maintained branches. However, it is important to note that the code in question is not located inside an ifdef in the Bitcoin Git master.</p>
