    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker had previously commented on their references to wallet version, which were actually in reference to nFileVersion. They have been able to update both the nFileVersion and the real wallet version since then. However, the wallet still rescans the last 14,000+ blocks every time it is invoked, which seems unnecessary. The speaker cannot explain why this is happening more than once. To avoid this issue, the speaker plans to send the balance from their old wallets (version 10500) to a new wallet soon.</p>
