    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation starts off with one person mentioning a similar idea for a different use case. The topic then shifts to the issue of block size and centralization. One person expresses uncertainty about whether larger blocks would actually lead to centralization, as it would take significant changes in transaction usage to reach gigabyte sized blocks. They also speculate that by the time we reach that point, technology will have improved enough that it won't be a concern anymore. It's noted that this is a topic that has been debated multiple times before, and there may be further discussion at a future meetup.</p>
