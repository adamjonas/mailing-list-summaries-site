    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this context is experiencing difficulty with the bitcoind software, which is refusing to respond to various rpc queries and signals. The writer notes that the software registers these actions in the debug log, but they do not occur as expected. They suggest that the software should be checking for and processing all user interrupts once per block while doing the chain in the background. The writer also questions how busy commerce servers deal with this poor rpc handling and wonders if there is a way to increase the priority of user scheduled tasks. Overall, the writer is seeking an answer to what's going on with the bitcoind software.</p>
