        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Luke-Jr, a developer, has proposed a new proof-of-work algorithm that aims to prevent attackers from harming a pool by not submitting shares that are also valid blocks. This attack is effective proportional to the ratio of the attacker's hashrate to the rest of the pool. The proposed solution involves accepting blocks at a lower difficulty N if they are submitted with a candidate for the next block and SHA256(SHA256(NewBlockHash + NextBlockCandidateHash)) meets difficulty M. This algorithm guarantees that every share has an equal chance of being a valid block at the time it is found. However, the proposal requires a hard-fork in the blockchain, and poolservers will need to adapt significantly. Existing miners, FPGAs, etc should work unmodified.The proposed solution is designed to prevent attacks on the pool, which can be harmful. The current attack is effective proportional to the ratio of the attacker's hashrate to the rest of the pool. With the new proof-of-work algorithm, accepting blocks at a lower difficulty N with a candidate for the next block ensures that every share has an equal chance of being a valid block at the time it is found.However, the implementation of this solution is not straightforward. A hard-fork in the blockchain is required, and poolservers will need to adapt significantly. Nevertheless, existing miners, FPGAs, etc should work unmodified.</p>
