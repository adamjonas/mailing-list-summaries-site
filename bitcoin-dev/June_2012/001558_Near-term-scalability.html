    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2012 email exchange, Amir Taaki discussed the issue of the block reward being too high with Satoshi Nakamoto, suggesting that it was the reason why transactions were so cheap. Taaki proposed a solution where blocks would require a cumulative fee of XN BTC for N transactions before being accepted. However, another individual responded to Taaki's idea by stating that it had already been suggested and dismantled on the bitcointalk forums. Despite this, there are still many ideas being shared on these forums and knowing what doesn't work can be just as valuable as knowing what does.</p>
