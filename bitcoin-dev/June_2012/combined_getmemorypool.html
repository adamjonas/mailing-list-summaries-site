        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article focuses on Luke Dashjr's getmemorypool/BIP22 pull request, which has been open for a long time and has received little discussion. The author believes that having a stable and flexible API for negotiating block generation is important to be standardized. The three subrequests are template, proposal, and submit. To simplify the standard, the author suggests limiting the API to sending only txids in templates and submissions. The article goes on to address several optional features of the standard such as coinbase outputs, coinbase input, noncerange limiting, time/*, transactions/add, transactions/remove, and prevblock. The author proposes that the standard should be simplified to include only getblocktemplate and submitblocktemplate. The former creates a new block template and returns it with certain fields such as bits, previousblockhash, version, and more. The latter submits an object containing a hex serialized block header, hex serialized coinbase transaction, and a list of txids. Additionally, the author suggests standardizing on having all transactions be removable (perhaps except those marked 'required') and discarding the other ways of specifying the same behavior. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of having a standardized, stable, and flexible API for negotiating block generation and highlights the proposed changes to the getmemorypool/BIP22 pull request.</p>
