    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user, grarpamp, reported that the command 'detachdb' was not appearing in the help section of the latest build of Bitcoin. This is because it is included under 'pnp', which was not set in their build. They requested for a fix to be made for this issue. However, it was noted that the command was not inside the ifdef in the git master of Bitcoin. In the future, it was suggested that such requests be posted on the GitHub issue tracker instead of being sent to the mailing list.</p>
