    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Jonathan Warren, who goes by the name Atheros on Bitcointalk, measures mainnet confirmation times regularly. He posted a chart of transaction confirmation times from June 2012 on bitcoinstats.org. Before "fairly recently," fee-paying transactions did not take as long to be confirmed. Jeff Garzik, in an email to the bitcoin-development mailing list, brought up the issue of SatoshiDice and near-term scalability. He stated that a hard-fork would require significant community buy-in since older clients would refuse to accept blocks larger than 1MB. Garzik asked if anyone measured mainnet "normal tx" confirmation times on a regular basis and if there was any other hard data available.</p>
