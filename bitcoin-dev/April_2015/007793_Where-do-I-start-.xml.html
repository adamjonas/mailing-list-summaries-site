    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A CS student, Gabe Appleton, posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list seeking advice for his upcoming research project. He inquired about any possible issues he could assist with regarding Bitcoin Core and where to begin. Being a newcomer, he acknowledged that he would need to conduct prior research before diving into a large-scale project. Additionally, he asked if it would be best to create something new for the ecosystem instead of assisting with any current projects. The email contains two additional parts, an HTML attachment and an advertisement for BPM Camp, a free virtual workshop on May 6th at 10am PDT/1PM EDT. The BPM Camp is designed to develop one's process in accordance with the BPMN 2 standard and learn process modeling best practices with Bonita BPM through live exercises.Overall, Gabe Appleton seeks guidance on how to contribute to Bitcoin Core for his research project and inquires about potential areas to focus on. The email also includes information on a free BPM Camp virtual workshop.</p>
