    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Alan Reiner discusses his proposal for multisig address generation. He explains that his proposal was created before BIP45 existed but wasn't vocal enough about it due to Armory not having BIP32 Multisig trees implemented yet. Reiner proposes a scheme that is similar to BIP45 but collapses the "cosigner_index" and "change" fields into a single field with a different formula. William Swanson points out that Reiner's scheme ultimately produces the same number and type of chains as BIP45 but just addresses them differently. Swanson expresses his preference for BIP45's approach of giving each field its own dedicated purpose. He also discusses Airbitz's ideal structure for HD tree, which would be BIP 44 plus some "no-collision" logic. Reiner explains his "no-collision" scheme for multi-signature wallets, which doesn't require modifying the key tree structure at all except for adding new internal and external chains. All siblings watch all chains, but only generate receiving and change addresses on their two chains. Reiner prefers not adding even more levels to the key tree and thinks it makes more sense to add more chains to the wallet instead of adding a new tree level. However, he acknowledges that there may be a certain momentum behind the cosigner-index method already in BIP45.</p>
