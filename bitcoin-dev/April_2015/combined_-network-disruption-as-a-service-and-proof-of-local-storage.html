        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing ways to prevent a single entity from running multiple nodes in order to harvest transaction origin IPs. One proposed solution is to challenge nodes to send a specific piece of data, such as SHA256(SHA256(concatenation of N pseudo-randomly selected bytes from the blockchain)). The response time would be too slow for anyone trying to cheat, but it would require each node to keep its own copy of the blockchain. Some participants have suggested that a company could host hundreds of lightweight servers all backed by a single copy of the blockchain, rather than forcing every machine to have its own copy.Sergio Lerner has proposed a "Proof of Local Storage" protocol to prove local possession which can be useful in any application to try to prove a keyed copy of some data. In an email conversation, Wladimir J. van der Laan raised a concern about a proposed exercise to ensure more full nodes on the network. Matt Whitlock had suggested that an entity could pass the query to a random other node and forward its result in response to a challenge. Wladimir pointed out that it would not even be necessary for the entity to run a full node; they could just pass the query to a random other node and forward its result.In the context of Sybil defense and improving blockchain resiliency through proof of storage, the problem of pseudo-nodes is a major concern for the Bitcoin network. One potential solution to this issue is to require each peer to demonstrate resource consumption before being allowed to connect to other peers. Gmaxwell proposed Proof of Storage, while Sergio introduced a protocol called "Proof of Local Storage." Unlike Gmaxwell's proposal, Proof of Local Storage does not require additional data storage and allows peers to prove that they are maintaining a full copy of the blockchain. The main idea behind Proof of Local Storage is to use asymmetric-time-encoding. The blockchain is encoded in such a way that it takes 100 times longer to write than to read.The proposed challenge-response protocol for verifying full nodes involves proving local possession in blockchain technology. Sergio Lerner introduced an improvement where the verifier asks the prover to send a Merkle tree root of hashes of encrypted blocks with N indexes selected by a pseudo-random function seeded by a challenge value. This protocol allows a node to prove another peer that it is storing a local copy of a public file, such as the blockchain, without needing to waste additional resources. The discussion also touched on the use of spinning media versus SSD for random reads.Ultimately, only nodes that wish to prove full-node-ness, such as those seeking bitnodes subsidy, would need to implement the protocol. It is also possible to restrict the challenge-response to a portion of the block-chain. In Gmaxwell's proposal, each peer builds a table for each other peer. In Sergio's proposal, each peer builds a single table (the encrypted blockchain), so it could be possible to establish thousands of connections to the network from a single peer. However, an attacker's IP will be easily detected and it is possible to restrict the challenge-response to a portion of the block-chain.</p>
