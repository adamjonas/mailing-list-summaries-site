    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses a proposal to use a constantly reused address as a messaging layer, which may undermine the privacy of the idea. The output associated with notification transactions would require special handling to avoid privacy leaks and would require mixing or being donated to miners as a transaction fee. Payment codes are suggested as an alternative solution, which can positively identify customers and provide refund capabilities in a merchant-customer relationship. However, payment codes could be more expensive to compute and are incompatible with multisignature. The proposal optimized for non-reliance on third-party services and a guaranteed ability to recover spendable funds from a seed backup. It is suggested that there are enough benefits to make them worthwhile, particularly for bitcoin businesses in some jurisdictions to move out of money transmitter territory.</p>
