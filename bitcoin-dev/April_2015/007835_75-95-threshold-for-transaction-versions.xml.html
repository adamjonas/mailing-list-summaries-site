    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Stephen Morse and Peter Todd regarding transaction malleability, Morse expressed his preference for a solution that prevented mutation with one simple change instead of using the "whack-a-mole" approach of BIP62. However, Todd disagreed and argued that preventing mutation was only necessary in two cases: spending unconfirmed change and large reorganizations. He also criticized the potential for missing cases with the BIP62 approach and the poor engineering of building wallets with strong assumptions about malleability. Instead, he proposed integrating both solutions and using a purpose-built signature hashing algorithm for protocols that require malleability resistance. Despite his reservations, Todd agreed that "Build your own nHashType" could be useful for enabling more complicated uses of chained transactions like micropayment channels.</p>
