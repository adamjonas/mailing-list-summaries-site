    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group of developers are discussing the concept of Proof of Payment (PoP) as a way to verify that a payment has been made. The idea is that a PoP would show that a sender is in control of certain addresses, indicating that they have sent funds to a recipient. The group discusses various use cases for this technology, including waiting in comfort, authorized pickup, non-monetary gifts, and contingent services. One member suggests the possibility of using PoP to prove a transaction could be created, but removing the transaction ID from the output may be necessary. Another member suggests making PoPs permanently invalid transactions to prevent them from being mined and spending everything on fees or in cases involving reorganizations. However, changing the version number or using a high lock_time may be an alternative solution. The group agrees that PoP could be complementary to BIP70.</p>
