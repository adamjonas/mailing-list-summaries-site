    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 4/22/2015, Kalle Rosenbaum proposed a standard format for Proof of Payment (PoP) that could allow wallet-controlled funds to be proven as spent as they were in a real transaction. The PoP would give wallets a new way to communicate with the outside world. The standardized PoP could separate payment and delivery in time without relying on an external mechanism to bitcoin's cryptosystem. This feature could enable standardized real-world scenarios where sender does not equal beneficiary and/or receiver does not equal provider. The Proof of Payment site contains links to the source code for both the server and a Mycelium fork as well as pre-built apk:s. Several scenarios in which it would be useful to prove that payment has been made are mentioned such as a pre-paid hotel room where your PoP functions as a key to the door, an online video rental service where you pay for a video and watch it on any device, an ad-sign where you pay in advance for exclusivity, and a lottery where all participants pay to the same address, and the winner of the T-shirt is selected among the transactions to that address.</p>
