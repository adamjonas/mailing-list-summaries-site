        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn has made his tutorial talk from DevCore 2015 available on the website. The tutorial provides detailed instructions on building a timestamping smart contracts app in just 30 minutes. It covers various aspects such as customizing the wallet-template app, constructing a complex multi-stage SPV proof of blockchain inclusion, saving and verifying proof files, binding transaction confidence state to the user interface, and creating a Mac DMG bundle with a custom icon.Hearn also announced an upcoming event called DevCore London, where he and other developers will be present to run a hackathon/workshop type event. During this event, Hearn will showcase a live coding session where he will write a decentralized cross-platform Tor supporting document timestamping app using OP_RETURN outputs. The app will have a user-friendly GUI and will be developed on stage within a span of 30 minutes.The event is open to the public and will take place at etc.venues St Paul's on April 15th. Apart from Hearn, attendees will include Gavin, Wladimir, Corey, and an unnamed individual. In the afternoon, the unnamed individual will host a hackathon/workshop event with a focus on contracts, although other topics will also be covered. The event aims to demonstrate the ease of writing contract apps in recent years. It promises to provide a hands-on experience for real developers rather than just being a platform for discussions.</p>
