    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.1 has been released with bug fixes and translation updates. It is recommended that users upgrade to this version. The distribution is available from the website, as well as a torrent using magnet links. Source code can be found in git under the tag `v0.10.1`, or in `bitcoin-0.10.1.tar.gz` in the distribution. Users should report any bugs using the issue tracker at github. There are no notable changes in this minor release, but for notable changes in the 0.10 release, users should refer to the release notes at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md</a>. The change log includes detailed release notes on changes that affect external behaviour.The upgrade process requires users to shut down their older version of Bitcoin Core and wait until it has completely shut down. For Windows, users should run the installer and for Mac/Linux, they should copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt. However, it is important to note that release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download which means that the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software. Other changes include fixes to RPC, block and transaction handling, P2P protocol and network code, validation, build system, GUI and miscellaneous. Credits have been given to those who contributed to this release, including those who directly contributed and those who contributed additional code review and/or security research. Translators on Transifex were also recognized.</p>
