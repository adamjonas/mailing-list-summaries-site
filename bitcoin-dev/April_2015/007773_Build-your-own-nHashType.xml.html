    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Stephen proposes an idea related to signing transactions in Bitcoin. However, Mike expresses his concerns on the practicality and security of some of the combinations proposed by Stephen. He questions the point of excluding the connected output script or value while still signing the prev tx hash, and also highlights the danger of writing blank cheques that can be used by anyone if certain combinations are used. While he acknowledges that the idea could work with proper documentation and careful thought, he suggests that the most important change needed in sighash calculation is to avoid hashing data unnecessarily. Finally, he leaves the topic of soft fork for later discussion and mentions that any change in CHECKSIG or a new version of it would likely be ready around the same time as the hard fork required for changing the block size limit.</p>
