    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Payment codes provide a simpler method for identifying the payee and establishing the identity of the payer, which ultimately allows the payee to receive the information they need to send a refund. If merchants and customers were using payment codes, they would not need the BIP70 equivalents. It is believed that payment codes add the missing "from address" to transactions, which users have longed for but were told they couldn't have. They behave more like an email address than a traditional Bitcoin address. In response to a suggestion from Mike Hearn in 2015, a comparison was requested between payment codes and extending BIP70 while combining it with a simple Subspace style store-and-forward network.</p>
