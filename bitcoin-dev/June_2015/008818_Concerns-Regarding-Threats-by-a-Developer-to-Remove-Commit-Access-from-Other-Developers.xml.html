    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin's block-size limit has been a topic of debate for some time. Some individuals have proposed inaction as a solution, but this is not necessarily the case. The concern is that inaction could occur through momentum, combined with adoption rates, making any hard fork more complex if it continues to be delayed. Ross Nicoll expressed his belief that there's a likelihood inaction will kill Bitcoin, to which Matt Whitlock asked who is proposing inaction. While some argue for further debate, no one is arguing for total inaction as an outright decision. The debate has been about how to increase the block-size limit and whether to take action ASAP or delay action for further debate.</p>
