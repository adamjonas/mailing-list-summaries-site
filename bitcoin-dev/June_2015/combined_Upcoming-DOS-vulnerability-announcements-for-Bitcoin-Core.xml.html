        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On July 7th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell announced that he would be disclosing several serious denial of service vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Core, including CVE-2015-3641. He urged anyone running production nodes exposed to inbound connections from the internet to upgrade to version 0.10.2 as soon as possible. Upgrading older systems, particularly miners, was also important due to the BIP66 soft-fork, which was about to reach enforcing status. However, Maxwell delayed the announcement due to recent network turbulence and attempted DOS attack activity on relayed infrastructure. He mentioned that other cryptocurrency implementors had requested a longer horizon before disclosing the details of the vulnerabilities.</p>
