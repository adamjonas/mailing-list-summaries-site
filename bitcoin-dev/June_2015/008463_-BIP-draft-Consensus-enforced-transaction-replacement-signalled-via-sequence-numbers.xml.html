    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a proposal to enable safe transaction replacement by repurposing the nSequence field of a transaction input to be a consensus-enforced relative lock-time. The proposal makes use of the full range of the 32-bit sequence number which has rarely been used for anything other than a boolean control over absolute nLockTime, and does so in a way that is semantically compatible with the originally envisioned use of sequence numbers for fast mempool transaction replacement. The reference implementation and BIP draft can be found at the provided links. However, one concern raised was that external constraints often prevent the full range of sequence numbers from being used when interpreted as a relative lock-time, and re-purposing nSequence as a relative lock-time precludes its use in other contexts.</p>
