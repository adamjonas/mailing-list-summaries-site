    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 23, 2015, Gavin Andresen and Pieter Todd had a discussion regarding the block size increase. Wladimir had initially suggested that the intention behind the block size increase was to scale once to provide time for more decentralization solutions to develop. However, Todd disagreed with this suggestion, stating that if the process needed to be repeated every year, then it would not be a one-time scaling. Todd agreed that Bitcoin's blockchain could grow proportionally as long as there is an availability of bandwidth, storage, and processing power. However, he argued that an initial bump of 8 MB and the growth rate afterwards seemed like a no-effectively-limit-ever. Todd expressed his concerns about the removal of several protections that are currently in place due to the wish of not wanting to deal with a hard problem. Despite the belief that 8 MB won't be created immediately, Todd preferred a system where he did not need to rely on anyone's guesses for the future.</p>
