    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the ongoing debate around the block size limit in Bitcoin and the proposed hard fork to XT by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn. While there is general agreement that the limit needs to be increased, many are not in favor of the hard fork proposed by Gavin and Mike, citing alternative proposals such as Cameron Garnham's dynamic block size adjustment and Jeff Garzik's rewritten proposals as being superior. Additionally, the notion that everyone supports the hard fork proposal is challenged, particularly in light of examples such as Chinese exchanges rejecting it. There are concerns surrounding non-consensus hard forks, which are considered extremely dangerous for consensus. Despite this, Gavin and Mike have been polling key players in the ecosystem and believe that a consensus exists, although some argue that they are basing this on a limited group of people. The email thread ends with a discussion around the urgency of the situation and the need for a process to end the debate.</p>
