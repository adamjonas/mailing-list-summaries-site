    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the email apologizes for possibly wasting their recipient's time regarding PGP/MIME. It seems that a SPAM filtering service may be causing some issues with encoding characters in plain text messages, which is why thunderbird/enigmail has difficulty verifying signatures. However, when importing messages from gmane without going through the SPAM filter, enigmail does not have any problems with verification. The writer posits that they had not noticed this issue before because all other signed messages they receive are encrypted and the SPAM filter does not mess with non-plain text data. In a previous email, Peter Todd had responded that enigmail was working correctly, but that the issue might lie with mailman (the mailing list software) rewriting parts of messages. However, Todd confirmed that PGP/MIME does indeed support partially signed content.</p>
