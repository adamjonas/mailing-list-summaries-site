    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message from 2015, Pieter Wuille and Wladimir expressed their views on the need for larger blocks in Bitcoin's blockchain. While they agreed that systems need to evolve over time, they fundamentally disagreed that fear for a change in economics should be considered a necessity for larger blocks. They both found it worrying to see political pressure tactics being used to change a distributed consensus system. The consensus rules are like rules of physics and cannot be changed according to the needs of some groups. They pointed out that developers work on improving technical aspects, not governing the system. Expecting a few developers to make controversial decisions would break expectations and make life dangerous for those developers. The idea of hardforks that make politically loaded changes made them hostile towards hardforks. They emphasized that resiliency and decentralization are the key aspects they would not want to risk breaking the system or changing its properties out of perceived necessity and fear.</p>
