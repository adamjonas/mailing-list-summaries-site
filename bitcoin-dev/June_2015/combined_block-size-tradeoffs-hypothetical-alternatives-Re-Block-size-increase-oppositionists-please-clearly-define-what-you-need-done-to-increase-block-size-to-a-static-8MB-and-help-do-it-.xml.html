        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The main focus of the context is on improving Bitcoin's functionality and scalability while maintaining decentralization, privacy, and security. To achieve this, proposals should be analyzed carefully in terms of bandwidth assumptions and game-theory. It is suggested that BIPs need a security, privacy, and decentralization/fungibility section as these are important factors that should be considered in any proposal related to block size increase. While increasing capacity is a good idea, it is essential to keep in mind that core functionality must remain for Lightning and other scaling approaches to remain secure by using Bitcoin as a secure anchor.The security model of Bitcoin is based on decentralization which prevents double spending without the use of a trusted third party. However, there is a lack of definition and evidence regarding decentralization being key to Bitcoin's security model. Therefore, a more precise problem description is necessary to focus on helpful questions such as the incentives that exist to increase or reduce any tendencies for nodes to collude with miners or behave as trusted third parties. MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is also related to these questions.The author of this text has been researching how decentralization can be defined and measured, and shares a link to a paper on measuring decentralization of government functions, which provides a framework for defining decentralization metrics in a standard way. While not directly related to Bitcoin, the paper could be useful in understanding how decentralization can be measured.</p>
