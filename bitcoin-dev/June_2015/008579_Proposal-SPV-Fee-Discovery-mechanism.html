    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of blocks filling up is a major concern for wallets. One possible solution could be to work directly with the largest miners and pools to get transactions into blocks. The miners would auction off space in their blocks, guaranteeing that they would be included in the accepted order. This would result in a federated service operator style model instead of a peer-to-peer network, but it would avoid unpredictable transaction failure. Additionally, this approach would allow for a send-and-forget usage pattern and known upfront fees. Large hosted wallet companies may end up moving towards this type of model. Although Mike Hearn argues that dropped transactions would be predictable by lowest fee/KB first, Aaron Voisine counters that from the perspective of the user sending the transaction, it is still unpredictable.</p>
