    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the decision-making process for code changes to Bitcoin Core. For changes that do not affect consensus, Wladimir is the decision maker, but he takes into consideration other technical opinions and seeks clear agreement among developers on the project. For changes to the consensus rules, each individual user decides what code they run and what rules they enforce. The author believes that users should adhere to the principle that there should be no changes to the consensus rules unless there is near complete agreement among the entire community, including users, developers, businesses, and miners. This principle ensures that everyone agrees on what Bitcoin is and gives it its value. Therefore, users should run the old consensus rules until pretty much everyone has consented to a change in the rules. The author thinks this principle will make the system work best. For code changes to Core that do change consensus, the author believes that most committers and developers on Core would defer to the principle mentioned above and wait for its outcome to be clear before considering such a code change.</p>
