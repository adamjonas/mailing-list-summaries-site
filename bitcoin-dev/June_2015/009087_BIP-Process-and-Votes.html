    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the role of a Bitcoin Core release manager who is responsible for deciding what goes into the release, and it has nothing to do with any specific person. The need for a process to be developed is highlighted so that issues are not sidetracked into a dramatized discussion over personalities, which is deemed a waste of time. It is mentioned that some developers have become full-time drama queens who write a little bit of code on the side. Jeff Garzik agrees that the Bitcoin Core release manager is doing an amazing job under difficult circumstances and clarifies that he is not an elected decider but rather has been appointed to the role. Overall, the discourse emphasizes the importance of having a clear process in place to avoid unnecessary distractions and focus on the core issues at hand.</p>
