    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Luke Dashjr and Kevin Greene, the topic of whether SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets would have to pay to connect to the network was discussed. Kevin Greene expressed concern that if users of SPV wallets had to pay a fee every time they synced with the network, it would be confusing and frustrating for them. This could also incentivize users to switch to centralized wallet services like Coinbase, which would not require such fees. Additionally, tying up outputs every time a user opens their wallet could lead to issues when trying to make a payment. Luke Dashjr argued that SPV is not the "right" way to participate in the network, as running a full node would allow users to earn more bitcoins than they pay out. However, Kevin Greene pointed out that SPV is currently the best option for mobile wallets to participate in the network in a decentralized way. The proposal to charge fees for SPV connections could therefore make the user experience for mobile wallets less desirable.</p>
