    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the Proof of Payment (PoP) feature for Bitcoin. Kalle Rosenbaum, who proposed the feature, discusses its limitations and use cases with Pieter Wuille. Rosenbaum notes that PoP allows for better privacy for customers who don't want to give out personal information such as email addresses. Wuille questions why anyone cares who paid and suggests that tracking payments rather than assigning identities to payers is a better approach. However, Rosenbaum indicates that the identity of the payer is necessary for PoP to work since the wallet used to pay must also be used to issue the PoP. The two discuss methods of sharing PoPs, including forwarding requests or transferring keys to friends' wallets. They also compare PoP to using tokens and note that tokens are reusable, whereas PoP is only usable once, which minimizes the window of opportunity for thieves.</p>
