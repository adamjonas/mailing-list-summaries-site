        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A patch for the First-seen-safe Replace-by-Fee is now available on GitHub, which is offering a 1 BTC bounty to anyone who can find a way to attack miners running this patch. The creator of the patch has specified that they are concerned about things that could lead to significant losses for those miners, such as a total crash or excess bandwidth usage. For reference, an example of a crash exploit found by Suhas Daftuar has been provided. The first person to report any issues will get priority and adding a new test that demos the exploit to the unit tests will be looked upon favorably. The creator has emphasized that there are no hard promises with regards to payouts and that they have budgeted over 2BTC for this project. A pull request has also been open for a few weeks.</p>
