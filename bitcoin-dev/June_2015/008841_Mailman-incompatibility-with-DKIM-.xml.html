    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the removal of footers during testing of a new list to be more compatible with DKIM users, which is used by most mail on the internet. DMARC rules are used by heavily phished domains like Google, PayPal, eBay, and BitPay to publish statements that all mail from their domain should be signed correctly. These rules are enforced by major webmail providers including Gmail, but some rusty geek infrastructure has problems with this. The poster opines that everyone should use DKIM/DMARC as adding cryptographic integrity to email is not a crazy idea. It is noted that SourceForge does not drop DKIM enforced mail but it may get caught in spam filters.</p>
