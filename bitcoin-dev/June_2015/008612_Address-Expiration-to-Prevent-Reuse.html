    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about reducing the rate of increase of Bitcoin addresses that have to be monitored forever for future payments, Tom Harding suggested adding an expiration date to Bitcoin addresses. Gregory Maxwell responded by saying that the problem could be solved by encoding an expiration into the address and specifying that clients enforce it. Another member of the group, who was late to the discussion, recommended anything that would mitigate the problem of reuse should be to the maximum extent possible, the user's option. They proposed that stealth address proposals would be better suited for handling the reuse problem and referred to a stealth BIP (BIP 63) recently re-discussed on Bitcointalk. The message also included an unrelated advertisement for the Go Parallel website, which is sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media. The message was signed using PGP encryption.</p>
