    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in June 2015, there was debate over whether a proposed hard fork would be controversial. Some members expressed concern about relying on a single person to determine what is considered controversial, as a loud minority can make any change seem controversial. It was suggested to wait until things had "cooled down" before proposing the hard fork. The conversation referenced the phrase "I know it when I see it," which comes from a US Supreme Court ruling regarding obscenity. The phrase has since been used in various contexts to describe subjective judgments.</p>
