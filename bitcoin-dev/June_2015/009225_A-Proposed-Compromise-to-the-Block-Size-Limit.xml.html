    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and Mark Friedenbach about the Lightning Network, Andresen expressed skepticism about its use for everyday transactions. He argued that very few of his own personal Bitcoin or dollar transactions fit the semi-long lived payment endpoint use-case that the Lightning Network is designed to solve. While he acknowledged its potential for innovation in micropayments for bandwidth or paying workers by the hour, he did not believe it was a scaling solution for the types of payments currently handled by the Bitcoin network. Additionally, Andresen raised concerns about centralization, questioning whether payment channels between big financial institutions would only increase the centralization concerns related to increasing the max block size.</p>
