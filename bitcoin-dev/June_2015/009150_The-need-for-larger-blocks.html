    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jorge Tim贸n discusses the risks of both "doing nothing" and "raising the limit" in an email dated 6/27/2015. He notes that before something actually happens, everything is mere speculation, making it difficult to gauge what the majority wants. Tim贸n mentions the risk of a lot of people being disappointed in a system that can't scale or adapt to significant changes. Though the exit option exists, he believes that this path would be messier and unwarranted. Perceptions of these risks vary, and there is no clear mechanism currently to determine what the majority wants. Tempting as it may be to do nothing, Tim贸n suggests that conducting a "software fork" is the only way to see how many people and interests are in favor of bigger blocks. The philosophical question of whether the majority has the moral right to dictate the minority is a complex one that Tim贸n advises leaving out of the discussion.</p>
