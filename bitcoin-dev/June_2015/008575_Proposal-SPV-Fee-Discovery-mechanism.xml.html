    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Peter Todd and Aaron Voisine on Jun 11, 2015, discusses the need for ways to increase transaction fees after initial broadcast via replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent. However, Peter raises concerns about the vulnerability of replace-by-fee to fabrications by transaction relay services and suggests that learning about fees is the "sensor" side of fee mechanics, while replace-by-fee is the "actuator" side. He also proposes using information in the blockchain, which is verified by all verifying nodes and refined by all miners, as a powerful source of pricing information to make fee decisions. Additionally, Peter notes that transactions would be dropped in a predictable way, with lowest fee/KB transactions dropped first. Nathan Wilcox signs off from the email thread.</p>
