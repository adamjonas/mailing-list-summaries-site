    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The 1MB block size limit in Bitcoin is arbitrary and doesn't represent any technical or economic sweet spot, according to a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list. The post argues that unless specific use cases are put forward explaining how an increase in block size would marginalize them, then 8MB should be considered the minimum applicable size for raising the block size from a network propagation point of view. Furthermore, the post suggests that a real discussion needs to be had about finding the right sweet spot for block size and that it may even be the case that 1MB is too big. In addition, the post argues that increasing the block size has a greater chance of creating a fee market after coinbase subsidies decline.</p>
