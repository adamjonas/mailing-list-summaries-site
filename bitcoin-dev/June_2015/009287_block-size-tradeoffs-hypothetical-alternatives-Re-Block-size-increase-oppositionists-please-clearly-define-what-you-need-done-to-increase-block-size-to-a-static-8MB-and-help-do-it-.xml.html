    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to the provided context, BIP 101 has working code that can increase the block size and is ready for evaluation. However, it is unclear when Lightning and Sidechains will be ready for a fair and controlled test to be conducted. On June 30th, 2015, Adam Back suggested that people interested in higher tier data-center and throughput by high bandwidth use route should run an experiment as a layer 2 side-chain or analogous. He mentioned that there are a few ways to do this and it would be appropriate to discuss them. Adam also suggested that conducting such an experiment parallelly with lightning could be interesting and useful to see work on.</p>
