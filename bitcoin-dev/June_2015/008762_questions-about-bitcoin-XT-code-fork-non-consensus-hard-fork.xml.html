    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of non-consensus hard-forks and their accompanying risks is not a problem according to Troy Benjegerdes. He states that if the hard-fork is non-consensus, then those who do not agree should ignore it. In the event that a non-consensus hard-fork does break something, then the system has problems that need to be rethought. Benjegerdes believes that a non-consensus hard-fork may be beneficial in the long-term for the bitcoin ecosystem, as it would force the re-examination of some bad assumptions. In conclusion, he advises against picking a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel or attempting to buy a hacker who makes money by the megahash.</p>
