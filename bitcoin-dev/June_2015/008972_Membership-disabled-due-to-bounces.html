    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It seems like there was an issue with the Bitcoin-development mailing list where approximately 500 uncaught bounce notifications were received, causing some members to be unsubscribed due to excessive bounces. Matt Whitlock also experienced this and had to re-enable his membership on the list. Laszlo Hanyecz raised the concern about something being broken and questioned if it was related to the issues regarding SourceForge and the mail list hosting issue. Braun Brelin also experienced the same problem and wondered if others had seen the problem too. Warren suggested moving the list ASAP but needed both the LF sysadmin and an existing SF list admin to be online simultaneously to effect an orderly transition, which was scheduled for Tuesday at 8pm UTC. He asked for opinions on moving the list sooner in #bitcoin-dev.</p>
