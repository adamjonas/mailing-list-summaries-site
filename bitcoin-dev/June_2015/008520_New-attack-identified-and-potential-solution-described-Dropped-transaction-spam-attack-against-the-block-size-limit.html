    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The block size limit was implemented to prevent a massive block from being used as an attack to benefit the miner of that block. However, this opened up a different attack, where spammers can push up minimum fees for the benefit of miners by filling the mempool with enough spam transactions. This can be a net gain for miners depending on how many miners are participating. The attack would be expensive and only possible if the attacker is well-funded. Spamming a lot of transactions to fill the memory pool would cost $120 every 10 minutes. If spam continues at a rate exceeding the block size limit long enough for transactions to be dropped from mempools, the vast majority of spam transaction fees will never have to be paid. As real users pay higher fees to get their transactions through in a timely manner, spammers adjust their fees to minimize the cost of the attack and maximize effectiveness. Miners would simply have no way to fix this, as they can only put in the transactions that will fit under the block size limit.Large blocks created by a miner as a means to spam other miners out of competition is a problem because miners do not pay fees for their own transactions when they mine them. They collect the fees they pay. The proposed solution to this problem is to add a new rule on how fees are handled. Some amount of every fee should be considered as burned and can never be spent. Half of every fee would be burned and disappear forever, effectively distributing the value of those bitcoins across the entire money supply. The other half would be collected by the miner of the block as is done today. For this to work, we'd need to ensure a minimum fee is paid for most of the transactions in every block.</p>
