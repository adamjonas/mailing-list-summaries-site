        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Several members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list reported receiving messages indicating that their membership had been disabled due to excessive bounces. Braun Brelin, who only recalled sending one email on the list, questioned whether the issue was related to SourceForge's mail list hosting. Matt Whitlock also experienced this problem and had to re-enable his membership on the list. It is unclear if the issue is related to recent problems with the hosting service. Approximately 500 uncaught bounce notifications were received by the mailing list, causing some members to be unsubscribed due to excessive bounces. Warren suggested moving the list as soon as possible but needed both the LF sysadmin and an existing SF list admin to be online simultaneously to effect an orderly transition. In 2013, a password was set after a debate that inspired the decision to improve Litecoin. The person responsible for fixing up Litecoin gave thanks to Gavin. In June 2015, Warren Togami Jr. received an email and was unsure how it could be causing bounces with a mailing list. No further information has been provided about the cause of the issue or any steps being taken to resolve it.</p>
