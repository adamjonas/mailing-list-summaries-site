    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Andy Schroder expressed his concern over digital signatures not working properly on messages due to the list server modifying them. Peter Todd inquired about the type of digital signatures and email client being used. Schroder mentioned that PGP/MIME signatures were not working right in Thunderbird. He also provided his email headers which showed that he was using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/24.2.0 and X-Enigmail-Version: 1.6. Todd suggested that it might be a Thunderbird issue as his mutt client handles signed and unsigned content just fine. Todd's signature was also present in the email.</p>
