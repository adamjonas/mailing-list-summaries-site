    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding, a respected poster, expressed his belief in leaving the growth of Bitcoin to the free market. Pieter Wuille stated that other systems already offer more capacity than Bitcoin can achieve with any blockchain technology currently available. However, Venzen challenged Tom's statement asking who is the "free market". He mentioned that the Bitcoin rally of 2013 was due to speculation by elements in Wall Street trading desk managers who saw an opportunity for a free-floating, unregulated commodity. Furthermore, he argued that miners are also finance capitalist interests, hence the term "free market" must be defined as it means different things under capitalism. In his opinion, applying Microsoft standards to FOSS efforts is like catering to all demands of the free market. Thus, Bitcoin developers must think about the economy and make provisions with protection.</p>
