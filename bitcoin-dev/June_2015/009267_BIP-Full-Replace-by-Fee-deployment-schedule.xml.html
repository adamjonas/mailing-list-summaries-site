    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tom Harding and Natanael on June 29, 2015, Natanael expressed concerns over the security of a proposed system. Harding dismissed the idea of a sybil attack and suggested that checking if a node relays something is not much different than banning it for relaying garbage. However, Natanael argued that the check means nothing since no information learned from it can be trusted for decision making. Unless one pays for hosting of that particular node, there is no reason to care other than simple statistics. The claims made by Harding were based on a simple economic analysis, stating that if attacking requires effort and risk that exceed the payoff, attackers are unlikely to try. Legal accountability, identification, and reputation building before being trusted with attack-worthy sums are strongly discouraging factors.</p>
