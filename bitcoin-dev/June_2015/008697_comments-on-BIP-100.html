    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, one user suggested a hard fork to remove the 1MB limit on block size. However, another user argued that this would result in an increase to 42 million bitcoins, half on each chain, and cause a severe market price correction. Instead, they proposed a soft-forkable extension-block approach, as described in a mail archive and Tier Nolan tech detail linked in the post. The Reddit thread linked in the post also discussed a soft-fork opt-in block size increase. Another user suggested a hard fork and merge-mining approach, allowing both the original 1MB limited bitcoin and a forked bitcoin with the block size limit removed to coexist. They argued that preserving the original bitcoin would keep diversity and prevent investors from feeling their investments were unnecessarily put at risk. The bitcoin core developers could implement a patch to allow the chain to fork at a set point, where bitcoins would be split into the new and old. The poster acknowledged potential branding issues but felt they were a small price to pay for not killing the original bitcoin.</p>
