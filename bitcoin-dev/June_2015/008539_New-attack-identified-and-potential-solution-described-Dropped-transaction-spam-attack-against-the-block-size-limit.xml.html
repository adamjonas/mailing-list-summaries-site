    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen, Raystonn, Loi Luu and Bitcoin Dev, they discuss a potential solution to the dropped-transaction spam attack against the block size limit. Raystonn raises concerns about enforcing certain policies, but Andresen responds by stating that as long as a reasonable percentage of hash rate follows the policy, it doesn't need to be enforced. The existing default mining policy may also be enough to prevent the attack from being successful. Andresen prefers this idea over his own proposed fix, which would have had a bigger impact on the economics of the system due to burning.</p>
