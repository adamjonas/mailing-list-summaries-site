        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell has developed a model for using Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) to communicate blocks between peers. The model is designed to be flexible, making few assumptions on transaction selection policy and relying on similarity in mempools with some selection hints. The selection hints are minimum fee-per-byte and bitmaps of included-despite-that and rejected-despite-that. It performs well on a 100 block sample in bitcoin-corpus, but actual results will have to be worse as peers oversize the IBLT to increase the chance of success.Rusty's implementation did not use a keyHashSum at all but only a concatenation of (txid48, fragid, tx-chunk) as value. Kalle Rosenbaum thinks this is a good idea and suggested removing all the count==1 fragments. Rusty replied that he keeps records of all the 1 and -1 buckets; separate lists depending on how far they are off the base. They also discussed making more comparable tests as proposed last year by Rosenbaum.The purpose of reencoding when relaying is to improve the failure probability as new transactions may have arrived in the mempool of the intermediary node. Exceptional transactions could instead be encoded in the IBLT, just as if they were unknown differences. Rusty said that it's pretty easy to cut the bitmaps to zero and test this, whereas the overhead of IBLT is some factor greater than txsize.Rusty thanks Kalle Rosenbaum for helping investigate IBLTs last year and adds that he works for Blockstream, while supposed to be working on Lightning.Last year, IBLTs were discussed with Rusty. It is unclear what the conversation was about, but it can be assumed that it was related to technology or computer science due to Rusty's background in those fields. IBLT stands for Invertible Bloom Lookup Table and is a data structure used in computer programming. More information about IBLTs and how they work can be found in the link provided.It is possible that Rusty was involved in the development or implementation of IBLTs in some way, as he is known for his contributions to the tech industry.</p>
