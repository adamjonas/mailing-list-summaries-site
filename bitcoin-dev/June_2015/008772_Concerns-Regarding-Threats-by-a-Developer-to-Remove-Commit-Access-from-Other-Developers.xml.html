    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post shared by a user on the Bitcoin development mailing list expresses concerns regarding a "nuclear suggestion" made by a particular developer in a video from June 8, 2015. The developer proposed revoking commit access from everyone else and making the change himself, which the poster believes is an act of sabotage against the Bitcoin community. The poster calls for the offending developer to make a formal apology and explanation for their behavior and suggests that this kind of bombastic suggestion makes them seriously concerned about the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The poster also mentions a recent policy change at bitcoin.org that may help prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.</p>
