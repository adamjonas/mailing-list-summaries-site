        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made to phase shift transaction fees by one block in order to prevent miners from putting in a bunch of transactions for free. The idea is that a miner would orphan a block that didn't properly reward them, making it very costly for the miner to do so. The phase can be adjusted to different amounts and spread over multiple blocks or even randomly selected at the time of mining from a pool of un-fee claimed blocks. However, this approach requires 100% mempool synchronization across all nodes on the network to reject a particular block. Otherwise, an attempted double spend could result in a fork in the network because some nodes saw it and some did not.The block size debate centers around the concern that if the block size is increased, malicious miners may publish unreasonably large "bloated" blocks. A solution proposed to detect these bloated blocks is to set a threshold by nodes on the allowable number of non-mempool transactions allowed in a solved block (e.g., maybe 50%). If a block contains more than this threshold of non-mempool transactions, it is rejected. The proposal states that if this idea works, the block size limitation could be completely removed.</p>
