        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is currently undergoing a transition to a new list server. The decision has been made to not link the old and new lists during this period. Instead, the switchover date will be announced soon, after which all posts to the old list will be rejected with a message directing them to the new list. The switchover is scheduled for Tuesday, June 23rd, 2015, with the exact time to be determined. Before the switchover, archives from the old list will be exported and imported into the new list server. Interested individuals can subscribe to the new list at <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev</a>. Test posts are also encouraged to help test configuration options and address long-standing spam filter-related issues.It is important to note that any posts made to the new list before the final switchover will be wiped from the archives. For those who have opinions or questions about the transition, they can join the discussion in Freenode #bitcoin-dev and speak to Warren Togami, who is leading the transition process.Overall, the bitcoin-dev community has decided on this approach to ensure a smooth transition to the new list server.</p>
