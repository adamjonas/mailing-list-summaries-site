    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the issue of guaranteeing transactions on Coinbase if 20% of the Bitcoin hashing power does not sign up for contracts. This problem is more related to centralized mining than zeroconf transactions. The author asks for confirmation if Coinbase is trying to get hashing power contracts with mining pools for guaranteed transaction acceptance, but there are no plans or contracts in place for that. However, Coinbase relies heavily on zeroconf transactions for merchant processing and would need to prevent fraud if a significant portion of mining pools ran an unsafe RBF patch. The author would love to see a safe, decentralized solution for accepting zeroconf transactions, but such a solution is not supported by any wallets in use currently. Breaking the current bitcoin behavior for everyone is not the best way to achieve this.</p>
