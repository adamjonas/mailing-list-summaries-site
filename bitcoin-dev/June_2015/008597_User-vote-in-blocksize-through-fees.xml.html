    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Matt Whitlock and Peter Todd on June 12th, 2015, they were discussing a voting system for miners. Whitlock suggested using two bits instead of just one to allow for more than two options. He proposed "0 0" as no preference, "0 1" to keep the limit the same, "1 0" to halve the limit, and "1 1" to double the limit. Whitlock suggested that user transactions should follow the same usage. Todd agreed with Whitlock's proposal, saying that taking the median of the three options and throwing away "don't care" votes entirely would make sense. However, Whitlock argued that the plurality of the three options after throwing away the "don't cares" would be better since it ensures that voting "no change" is meaningful. Finally, Todd shared his contact information.</p>
