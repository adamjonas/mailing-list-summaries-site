    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on June 16, 2015, Kevin Greene raised concerns about whether SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets would have to pay fees to connect to the Bitcoin network. He argued that from a user's perspective, it would be frustrating to see their balance slowly draining each time they opened their wallet app due to fees and tie ups in outputs. Moreover, he claimed that users of centralized wallet services like Coinbase would not have to pay these fees, creating incentives for users to opt for centralized wallets over native ones like breadwallet. He concluded that this would impose a worse user experience on those who want to use Bitcoin in the "right" way. In response, Luke pointed out that running a full node is the real "right way" to use Bitcoin and that users should be able to earn more Bitcoins than they pay out.</p>
