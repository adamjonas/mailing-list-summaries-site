    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author questions the need for a hard limit on block size in the Bitcoin protocol, citing issues such as difficulty propagating large blocks and creating a fee economy for miners as reasons for the current limit. However, the author argues that these issues could be addressed with configurable limits instead of a hard limit. The author also points out that the original reason for the limit, preventing spamming, is not as relevant now with ASIC mining and other measures in place. The author proposes that relay nodes can configure their own limits on block size and that hardware limitations should act as the bottleneck for growth rather than an arbitrary soft limit imposed by the protocol. The author questions whether there is a big reason for the hard-coded limit that affects the entire network and creates ongoing issues in the future.</p>
