    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message acknowledges that as projects grow in size and diversity, informal processes become inefficient. They suggest that a proposal for a better process should be made and posted to the list. However, there has been no interest in improving the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process, which was adapted from Python Enhancement Proposals by Amir Taaki in 2009. The BIP process has not changed much since then, apart from some spelling and grammar corrections. It is not specifically adapted to Bitcoin and does not distinguish between consensus changes and non-consensus changes. The author encourages someone who is enthusiastic about improving the process to do so.</p>
