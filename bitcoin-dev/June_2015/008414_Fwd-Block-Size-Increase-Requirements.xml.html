    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the impact of a block size increase on miners and their ability to continue mining. Warren Togami Jr. points out that no one has an inherent right to mine if they can't do the job. If miners outside of China can't get the required bandwidth through their firewall and end up being outcompeted, then it's too bad, and we'll have to carry on without them. On the other hand, Mike Hearn argues that he understands decentralization but doesn't want to dis incentivize mining. He mentions that miners who hold more than 50% hashing power are warning that any change in the block size limit will hurt them, and stripping bitcoin out of adopters' wallets would have the same effect. The email conversation suggests that there is a debate over whether or not to increase the block size limit and how it will affect miners. While Togami believes that miners should be able to compete efficiently, Hearn wants to avoid any negative consequences for the mining community. The discussion highlights the complexity of decision-making in the Bitcoin development community and the importance of considering all factors before making changes.</p>
