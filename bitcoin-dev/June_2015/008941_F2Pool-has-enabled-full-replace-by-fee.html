    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jorge Tim√≥n and Eric Lombrozo, the latter stated that the Bitcoin network was designed to be able to withstand double-spend attacks from anywhere at any time. However, Jorge disagreed with this premise and cited Satoshi Nakamoto's statement that as long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. According to Jorge, attacking the network means trying to rewrite valid and proof-of-work-timestamped history, which unconfirmed transactions are not part of yet. Eric clarified that he wasn't suggesting that unconfirmed transactions are part of global consensus and that it was dangerous to accept them as final unless the risks had been assessed for a particular business use case.</p>
