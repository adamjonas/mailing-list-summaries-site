    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In June 2015, Adam Back wrote an email expressing concerns about a proposed hard cap on the number of transactions per block. He suggested that users could park their Bitcoins on a hub channel rather than the blockchain, but this approach reintroduced the problem of ensuring that payment hubs connected to the correct recipient. There were concerns about centralization pressure and the potential for a few entities to corner the market and own the entire payment hub space. This untested concept did not justify restricting the bitcoin fee market below technical feasibility, and Back suspected that those who hoped to be future payment hub oligarchs might want to prevent bitcoin from improving.</p>
