    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Kalle Rosenbaum and Tom Harding, Kalle thanked Tom for his clarification regarding a previous message. The subject of the conversation was about how merchants need to ensure that they only accept a PoP provided as a response to their challenge. Kalle asked Tom if it would be difficult to explain to merchants that they must check the nonce in the PoP so that it matches the nonce in the pop request. Tom replied that he did not mean it would be hard to explain, but rather that Kalle had thought it out in detail. He also mentioned that standardizing a latent capability of the cryptosystem seemed very powerful for some classes of users.</p>
