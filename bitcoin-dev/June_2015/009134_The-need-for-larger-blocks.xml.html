    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum discussion, Peter Todd suggested the need to have websites that display the current mempool backlog and fees needed to get to the front of the queue. He believed that this is important, especially with the increasing number of projects aiming to build on the Bitcoin blockchain, which could result in spikes in storage space and transaction volume. In light of this, a proposal for a BIP to standardize reporting of "delay alerts" in wallets was made recently, allowing users to make informed decisions before sending their transactions during periods of high transaction volume. The author believes that keeping users informed of potential issues can prevent frustration and backlash against blockchain technology.</p>
