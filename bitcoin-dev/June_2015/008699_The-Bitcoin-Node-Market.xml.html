    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin development mailing list, Raystonn proposed a market-based solution to make it sustainable and profitable for nodes to run on the Bitcoin network in the long term. The idea is that nodes participate in a market where they are paid by other nodes, wallets, and services to supply Bitcoin network data based on the cost imposed on them to do the work. Nodes providing balanced full service will tend to have a balance of payments coming in and going out with regards to other balanced full service nodes, leaving them revenue-neutral there. They will receive payments from leech nodes, wallets, and other services. The cost to run nodes will be shared by those using the Bitcoin network but not contributing by running a full node. A market will develop for fees to connect to the Bitcoin network, which should help cover the cost of running the network.</p>
