    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion about the difficulties of making changes in a consensus-based system, specifically on the topic of the proposal to increase the blocksize limit in Bitcoin. The author agrees that changes more than trivial are difficult but disagrees that they can't be made. The larger issues have to do with concerns over the problems inherent in the totally unnecessary XT proposal itself. The author's thoughts on the proposal are written up on their website and have been supported by various others in the community, such as GreenAddress and Adam Back. In response, Aaron Voisine comments that if consensus must be reached to make any changes, that just means that changes of anything more than trivial consequence simply can't be made. Extreme bias toward the status-quo will only work if external factors affecting the network also remain static. The author acknowledges this but states that he is curious to see how this discussion progresses.</p>
