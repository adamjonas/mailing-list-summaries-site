    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from June 15, 2015, Rusty Russell expressed his thoughts on the softfork argument regarding Bitcoin's ordering use. He found the softfork argument to be the most compelling, though he also noted that it could be argued that every ordering use, including SIGHASH_SINGLE, is likely a mistake. This statement was followed by a brief pause and then Russell seemed to have a realization about the generalized sighash flag design he had been considering. The design was apparently neutral about ordering and yet still replaced SINGLE. Russell concluded his message by stating that he needed to take some time to think about this new information.</p>
