    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposed a new method for scaling Bitcoin using sidechains. Pieter Wuille criticized the proposal, stating that it would not solve any of Bitcoin's scaling problems and would make transactions slower, more complex, and less secure. The author responded by explaining that the chain the transaction goes to does not have to be based on the address and there will be an incentive for empty chains to fill up since they will require less fees. The author also clarified that at most 2 different chains can be involved in one transaction and explained the mining procedure. They argued that their proposal is the simplest way to scale Bitcoin and that there is no good argument against it.</p>
