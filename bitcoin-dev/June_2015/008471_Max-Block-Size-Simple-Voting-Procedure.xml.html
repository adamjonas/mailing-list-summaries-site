    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Stephen Morse and Pindar Wong discusses the idea of separating the hard/soft fork upgrades, establishing a process for the community to self-determine the way forward in a transparent and verifiable manner. Morse acknowledges the concern that many members of the bitcoin community would be hesitant about giving miners too much power. Wong believes that mining pools in China currently have such power, which could be unhealthy for the network. However, he thinks it would be interesting to involve them in decisions. The proposal essentially lets miners vote to change the rules of the system. Morse agrees that miners shouldn't be the only ones with a vote and suggests finding a level of rough consensus where members of the community feel comfortable enough to do this upgrade in their respective codebase. He also raises the possibility of a different possible path forward.</p>
