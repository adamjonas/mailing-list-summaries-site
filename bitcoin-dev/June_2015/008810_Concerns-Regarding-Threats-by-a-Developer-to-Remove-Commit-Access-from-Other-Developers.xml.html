    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Alex Morcos and Gavin Andresen discusses the decision-making process for changes to the Bitcoin Core. While non-consensus changes are decided by Wladimir and other developers, consensus changes are left up to individual users to decide what code they run and what rules they enforce. However, Morcos believes that there should be no changes to the consensus rules unless there is near complete agreement among the entire community, users, developers, businesses, and miners. He argues that this principle is what gives Bitcoin its value and makes it work best. Andresen suggests that a clear super-majority of people and businesses using Bitcoin the most should be the criteria for changes to consensus rules. The developers on Core would typically defer to this outcome before considering any code changes that would change consensus.</p>
