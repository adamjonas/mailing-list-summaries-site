    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list centered around the safety of unconfirmed transactions. Aaron Voisine argued that such transactions did not need to be cryptographically safe, but only needed to be safer than credit card payments that can be charged back. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed, stating that unconfirmed transactions would never be completely safe due to the possibility of double-spending. He explained that double-spending is prevented only because nobody is seriously trying to exploit it. Eric Lombrozo added to this by comparing the situation to newspaper vending machines, which are often left unmonitored because few people try to steal from them.</p>
