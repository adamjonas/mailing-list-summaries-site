    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 28, 2015, Gavin Andresen and Adam Back engaged in a conversation about the Lightning Network. Gavin was doubtful that the Lightning network would be better than using fully-validating bitcoin nodes with fewer hubs in terms of decentralization. When it came to trustlessness, Andrew Lapp explained that people should not mind central authorities being part of an option if they do not need to be trusted. Although most people agree that trustlessness is what matters, decentralization does not necessarily mean trustlessness. Gavin asked for further explanation regarding why the Lightning Network was better, and people responded by saying that working on the Lightning Network would scale algorithmically instead of dangerously increasing block-size. They also provided links to a paper from Joseph Poon, a blog post from Rusty, and a related paper from Christian Decker. Ultimately, they suggested that if users want to scale Bitcoin, they should work on lightning, as Lightning+Bitcoin can scale further and is more trustless than Bitcoin forced into centralisation via premature mega-blocks.</p>
