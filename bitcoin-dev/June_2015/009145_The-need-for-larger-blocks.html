    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread regarding the increase of block limits, NxtChg and "Wladimir J. van der Laan" discussed the risks involved in not increasing block limits versus the risks of doing so. NxtChg argued that failing to increase block limits may risk the passengers on a plane as it suddenly stops flying while Wladimir J. van der Laan felt that it was better not to increase the limit as this would maintain the current status quo. The thread focused on the option of 'doing nothing' which required a fix to mempool to scale with unconfirmed transactions if the blocksize limit is eventually removed. In case the blocks get full, there is an expected rise in fees and transactions with bigger fees will be confirmed first. The argument presented supports the notion that 'doing nothing' is a valid option that requires more work than any of the proposals for increasing the block size. It contradicts the perceived need to increase the blocksize limit soon. Finally, the idea of changing consensus rules and forcing everyone to adapt their software to these changes is not considered as 'maintaining the status quo'.</p>
