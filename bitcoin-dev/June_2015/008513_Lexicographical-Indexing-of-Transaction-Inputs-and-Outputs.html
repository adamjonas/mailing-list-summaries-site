    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kristov Atlas has suggested that a BIP should be implemented to ensure wallets implement randomization properly. The draft BIP has been updated to include input/output dependency schemes such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which require the order of inputs and outputs to be sorted appropriately. However, it was questioned why SIGHASH_SINGLE is included as its use-case is highly specialized protocols and it's better to stick to the use-cases where the need is clear and there exists running code. It was suggested that the BIP be presented in terms of a generic statement that "except when otherwise prevented by advanced signature hashing requirements, wallet software must emit transactions sorted according to the following." Two common cases were specified for SIGHASH_ALL and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. It was recommended to leave out discussions of IsStandard() rules and soft forks for now.</p>
