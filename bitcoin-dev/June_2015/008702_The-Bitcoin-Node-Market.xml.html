    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Raystonn proposed a market-based approach to incentivize running full nodes on the Bitcoin network. He suggested that nodes could be paid by other nodes, wallets, and services for supplying data to the Bitcoin network, with payment based on the cost imposed on the node. Nodes that are mostly leeching data from the Bitcoin network would send payments to nodes they connect to but would likely not receive payments from other nodes and services. On the other hand, nodes providing balanced full service would tend to have a balance of payments coming in and going out and would receive payments from leech nodes, wallets, and services. This approach would help share the cost of running the Bitcoin network among those who use it but do not contribute by running a full node. A market would develop for fees to connect to the Bitcoin network which should help cover the cost of running the network. It is still possible to continue offering access to your node for free, but market efficiencies should eventually mean nodes take in only what is required to keep the network operational.</p>
