    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on June 27, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan and others discussed the risks of increasing the block limit in Bitcoin. Van der Laan argued that not raising the block limit risked "the 'passengers' when the plane suddenly doesn't fly anymore." However, he also acknowledged that increasing the block limit could increase the risk of centralization. Another concern raised was the potential for hard forks to arise from conflicting expectations. Van der Laan ultimately expressed his preference for a community-wide vote on changes to Bitcoin, rather than leaving decisions up to individuals like Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, who were creating their own mechanisms for consensus changes.</p>
