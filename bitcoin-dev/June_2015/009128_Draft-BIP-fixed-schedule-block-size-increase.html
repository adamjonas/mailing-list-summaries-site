    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen, Pieter Wuille's simulations showed that miners with poor connectivity are negatively impacted by other miners creating larger blocks. However, Gavin Andresen argued that the effect is only significant if the miner has low-bandwidth connectivity and does nothing to work around it, such as renting a server on the opposite side of the bottleneck and writing code to ensure blocks propagate quickly. Peter Todd argued that requiring miners to rent a server would force them into deploying insecure hosted infrastructure vulnerable to hacking and seizure. He pointed out that there are several factors contributing to mining vulnerabilities, such as electricity usage and hacked/seized servers being easier to recover from than seized equipment. He further stated that requiring a reasonably reliable internet connection is not a high barrier to entry compared to the other mining requirements.</p>
