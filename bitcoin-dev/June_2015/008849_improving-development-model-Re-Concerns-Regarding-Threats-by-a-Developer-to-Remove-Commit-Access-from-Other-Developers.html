    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Adam Back expressed his concern that many companies operate on a 1-2 year time horizon and may not see the negative impact of killing layer2 until it is too late. Eric Lombrozo agreed with this sentiment, but also believed that the ideas behind layer2 are too powerful to be permanently eradicated. He argued that someone will eventually build something better than we can presently imagine, relegating Bitcoin to the history books and museums. Lombrozo also emphasized that first mover advantage and network effect are overrated, citing examples such as Yahoo! coming before Google and Myspace coming before Facebook.</p>
