    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Eric Lombrozo and Jorge Timón in June 2015, the two discussed their opinions on the ability of the Bitcoin network to withstand double-spend attacks. While Lombrozo believed that the network should be designed to handle such attacks, Timón cited Satoshi's statement that as long as a majority of CPU power is not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. Lombrozo clarified that he was not suggesting that unconfirmed transactions are part of any global consensus, but rather that merchants should assess the risks before accepting them as final. He also acknowledged that it is not the protocol's responsibility to protect merchants from double-spends, but rather the merchant's responsibility.</p>
