    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of an email to a Bitcoin mailing list has compared the digital currency to Windows 3.11, suggesting that there is a debate as to whether new developments should be made that don’t support older versions. The writer questions what will happen to those who don’t upgrade and have money tied up in the platform, and whether it should remain as it is with better programs being developed for it. Finally, he suggests that representatives from both sides of the issue appoint a developer representative and achieve a framework together.</p>
