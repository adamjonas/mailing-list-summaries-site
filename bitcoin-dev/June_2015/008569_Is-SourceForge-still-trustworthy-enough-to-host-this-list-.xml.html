    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a public email conversation on the Bitcoin development mailing list in June 2015, users discussed the possibility of moving to a paid mailing list provider from Sourcefoge. However, one user argued that there was no need to do so as Sourceforge was free and had a nice web UI where messages could be easily sorted and ordered. They also believed that paying per message would discourage community involvement, which would defeat the purpose of encouraging people to join the community, run full nodes, ask questions, come up with solutions, and ideas for improvements. The idea of paying per message was dismissed as far-fetched and likely to lead to a mailing list only used for advertisement and promotion, rather than technical discussion and release announcements. For those who did not like Sourceforge's web archive UI, other options were available via gmane.</p>
