        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Pieter Wuille, the difficulty of using a decentralized approach in Bitcoin was discussed. Wuille argued that while decentralization is desirable to remove central points of failure and reduce trust in the system, it's not always practical. He suggests that in cases where using a centralized service doesn't add anything, he cannot reasonably promote it. Hearn then responds by mentioning his experience trying to add a small "API" to Bitcoin Core which he needed for his app and how he had to fork Bitcoin to get it out there. Wuille explains that since Hearn's patch was to enable querying spentness of particular outputs, which is fundamentally unprovable data in Bitcoin, he doesn't see why Hearn would want anything else besides querying such a service. Wuille argues that the choice is between trusting a central service or trusting something a random peer on the internet tells you.</p>
