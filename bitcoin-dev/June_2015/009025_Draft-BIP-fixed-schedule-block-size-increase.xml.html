    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, responded to Gavin Andresen's BIP proposal for increasing the maximum block size by suggesting that August 1st, 2013 be used as the switchover date for testnet in order to fully test the real-world behavior of the entire infrastructure ecosystem, including load testing, scalability of block explorers, SPV wallets, feasibility of initial synchronization, scalability of the UTXO set, etc. He stressed the importance of seeing a wide range of realistic testing of what an 8MB limit could look like in the near future, especially since the Bitcoin ecosystem cannot afford to make a change like this blindly. Peter suggested that despite the inconvenience of 2 years of 8MB blocks being 840GB worth of data, the resources can be scraped together to voluntarily run a few hundred full-load full-nodes for testing a change with the potential to destroy the $3.5 billion market cap. He also pointed out that the BIP proposal had no information at all about testing, reproducible or not, and suggested that the Quality Assurance Test Plan done for BIP16 was a model worth looking at.</p>
