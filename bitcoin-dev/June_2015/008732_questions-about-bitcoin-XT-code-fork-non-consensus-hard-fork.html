    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn expresses his frustration over the constant insistence from Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and others that "the technical community" or "technical majority" agree with them. In contrast, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn have both been working on Bitcoin in substantial ways for longer than Gregory and Adam have been in the community at all. They have written vast amounts of analysis on the concerns raised by larger blocks and have carefully read and addressed dozens of points raised by the 1mb camp. However, they feel that they are not being shown the same respect by those who are so keen on 1mb blocks. Mike also mentions his upset over the fact that anyone who doesn't agree with them is labelled as "non-technical" or "not a contributor". He believes this is not true and needs to stop as it makes it difficult for either side to make progress in any kind of negotiation if one side constantly blows off the other and refuses to take anything they say seriously.</p>
