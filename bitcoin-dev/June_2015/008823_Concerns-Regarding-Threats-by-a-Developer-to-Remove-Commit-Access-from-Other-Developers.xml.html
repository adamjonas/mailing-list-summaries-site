    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn has proposed a change in the BIP process to remove consensus from it, which has been commented on by the Bitcoin Core developer. The proposal suggests that once a draft BIP has been submitted for consideration, a preliminary yes/no verdict is delivered by the Bitcoin Core maintainer within three weeks. If more time is required, the maintainer can request an extension from the BIP author. The verdict will address the latest version of the BIP and will spell out and describe the technical rationale for any rejections. However, the Bitcoin Core developer disagrees with this method, stating that the notion that "no BIP will be rejected on grounds of controversy, disagreement, lack of consensus, or otherwise," is clearly an attempt to do away with consensus models of business, which is not a very logical statement because controversy and disagreement are a natural part of coming to what eventually is an agreement. Additionally, the developer disagrees with the bias towards hard fork in the proposal.</p>
