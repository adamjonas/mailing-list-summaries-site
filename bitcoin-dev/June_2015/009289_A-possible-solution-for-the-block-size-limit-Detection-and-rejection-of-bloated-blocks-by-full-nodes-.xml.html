    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The block size debate in the world of cryptocurrency revolves around the fear that if block size is increased, malicious miners may publish unreasonably large "bloated" blocks. This could happen if a miner generates private, non-propagated transactions and includes them in the block they solve. However, it is argued that these bloated blocks can be easily detected by other miners and full nodes since they will contain a very high percentage of transactions not found in the nodes' own memory pools. This unique signature can be exploited to enable nodes to reject such bloated blocks. For instance, a threshold can be set by nodes on the allowable number of non-mempool transactions allowed in a solved block. If the block contains more than this threshold of non-mempool transactions, say maybe 50%, then it would be rejected. This idea, if implemented successfully, could mean that the block size limitation could be entirely removed.</p>
