    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the block size limit of Bitcoin, Roy Badami suggests that it is better to do something relatively uncontroversial like increasing the block size limit to something in the 4-8GB range without further increases without a further hard fork. He believes that hard forks need to become less scary and a sequence of (relatively) uncontroversial hard forks over time is way more likely to gain consensus than a single hard fork that attempts to set a schedule for block size increases out to 2035. He also thinks that a scheduled ramp up is an unnecessary complication and we should not commit to future block size increases years into the future as uncertainties around the Bitcoin landscape are going to be greater the further ahead we look. If a simple increase from 1GB to 4GB or 8GB will solve the problem for now, it should be done because it is quite likely that it will have to be done again in the future. Furthermore, he considers trying to pick the best value of the 2035 block size now as foolish because it is impossible to know what the requirements and conditions will be at that time. Instead, it is important for the Bitcoin community to demonstrate an ability to react appropriately to changing conditions.</p>
