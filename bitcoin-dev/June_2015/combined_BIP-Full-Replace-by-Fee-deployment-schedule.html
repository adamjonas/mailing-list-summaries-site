        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The use of Best Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to define Bitcoin's policy is a topic of discussion between various experts. While some argue that policy should be left up to node/miner fiat and not BIPs, others believe that BIPs about best practices or coordination are reasonable uses of the process. However, there are concerns about mixing protocol standards with policy suggestions, which could potentially hold miners liable for not enforcing BIPs and lead to government regulation of Bitcoin.The implementation of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) in Bitcoin transactions is also a topic of discussion, with suggestions for new methodologies such as "First-Seen-Safe Replace-by-Fee" and concern over centralization risks due to large payment providers considering extreme measures. There are also discussions around the use of multisignature notaries or payment channel-based hub-and-spokes for verifiable behavior and incentives to tell the truth, rather than relying on the P2P network.The Bitcoin network is at risk of centralization due to large payment providers considering extreme measures such as entering into legal contracts directly with large miners. This could lead to a temptation to kick non-compliant miners off the network entirely with a 51% attack, which would lead to unintended consequences directly opposing decentralization. In an email exchange, Adam Back suggested deploying full-RBF in an opt-in way and leaving the current default miner & relay policies as they are. This would allow for a smoother transition away from zeroconf assumptions towards greenaddress (trust-based) and lightning/payment channel solutions. Back believes that abruptly stopping the first-seen miner & relay policy is risky and unpopular and could lead to bad trends for fungibility. He warns about large centralized startups such as Coinbase getting hashing power contracts and sybil attacking the network. To prevent this, he suggests acting sooner rather than later in adopting full-RBF.Peter Todd expressed his belief that certain contracts were being actively worked on, likely due to a few miners not using the first-seen protocol in all circumstances. The implementation of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) could potentially create even more incentive for these types of contracts.LT) proposed a deployment schedule for Full Replace-by-Fee (Full-RBF) functionality, suggesting an automatic activation on Tuesday, April 5th, 2016, at 3 pm UTC upon which supporting relay nodes and miners will enable full-RBF mempool behavior on mainnet. Prior to the activation deadline, supporting nodes and miners will support first-seen-safe replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF) mempool behavior.Todd's proposal acknowledges the significant efficiency advantages of Full-RBF over alternatives such as FSS-RBF and Child-Pays-For-Parent for a wide variety of common transaction patterns, as well as smart contract protocols such as payment channels and auctions. The proposal also addresses concerns about decentralized wallets' ability to protect users from double-spends and large payment providers considering extreme measures, such as entering into legal contracts directly with large miners to ensure their transactions get mined, which is a significant centralization risk. Additionally, the proposal provides a reasonable implementation that is well-tested with considerations such as DoS attacks taken into account.In various email exchanges, participants discuss the role of policy in BIPs, the security of proposed systems, and the potential impact of IBLT on the first-seen policy. They also suggest ways to support opt-in full-RBF and warn against abruptly stopping the first-seen miner & relay policy, as it could lead to bad trends for fungibility. Overall, the discussions highlight the importance of maintaining network security, efficiency, and decentralization while implementing changes to the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
