    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr and Gregory Maxwell had a conversation regarding the role of policy in BIPs. While Luke stated that policy is node/miner fiat and not the domain of BIPs, Gregory argued that some BIPs about best practices or interop/coordination can be reasonable. He added that knowing what other kinds of policies are in use is important for authoring transactions that work at all. Luke expressed concern about issu ing a new BIP for every node's policy, as it could potentially hold a miner liable for not enforcing the BIP. He suggested an independent and updated database instead. Peter Todd pointed out that one of the goals of full-RBF is to reject the idea that miners should have any obligation with regard to what they're mining. He implied that his BIP proposal only suggests an implementation as a starting point without defining an exact standard.</p>
