        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On Tuesday, June 23rd, at 8 pm UTC (1 pm PDT), some changes will take place on the Bitcoin Dev List, and an important notice has been issued to its members. The current list at bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net will reject all posts, and the current archives at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/">http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/</a> will be exported. The test archives at the new list will be wiped and replaced with an import from the old list. The new list <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev</a> will be open to posts after the archive import is complete, and anyone can subscribe to the new list now and make test posts. However, anything posted before the switchover on Tuesday will be wiped from the archives.One issue with this list is that posts from domains that require DKIM signature verification will end up in the spam folder at popular providers like Gmail. Initially, the new list will have the same problem as they will continue to have the subject tag and footer. Within a few weeks, LF will upgrade Mailman to do automatic Munge From, which will solve this problem. Warren Togami has informed about these changes.</p>
