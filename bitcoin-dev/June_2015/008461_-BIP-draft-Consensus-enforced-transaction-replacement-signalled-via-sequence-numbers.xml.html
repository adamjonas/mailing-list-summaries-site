    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of implementing "not after" in Bitcoin script, which would make a script that was once valid later invalid. This would not be compatible with the current model of reprocessing transactions in later blocks if the block they were first in gets reorged. However, it is suggested that this loss of flexibility can be overcome by making it the previous holders responsibility to spend a "not before" back to themselves. A sample scriptPubKey is provided as an example. It is concluded that an inverted CLTV/CSV can be forgotten.</p>
