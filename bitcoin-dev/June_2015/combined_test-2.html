        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On June 22, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. raised an issue on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding an email from an un-subscribed user. He pointed out that the server should have automatically rejected the email, but it went through to the list instead. This led him to suspect a configuration problem. In his message, Togami included links to both the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the website for the Linux Foundation, which hosts the list.Togami noted that the email came from wtogami at apache.org, an address that is not subscribed to the list. The fact that the email was not rejected by the server indicates a potential configuration problem with the mailing list. To ensure the efficiency and security of the list, it is crucial to allow only subscribed email addresses to send messages. This helps prevent unauthorized individuals or spam from cluttering the list.Although the email had an HTML attachment, it had been scrubbed, meaning no information could be obtained from it. Despite this, Togami's post serves as a reminder to thoroughly review list configurations in order to maintain optimal efficiency and security. By addressing any configuration issues, the mailing list can better protect against unauthorized access and ensure that only authorized subscribers can contribute to the discussions.</p>
