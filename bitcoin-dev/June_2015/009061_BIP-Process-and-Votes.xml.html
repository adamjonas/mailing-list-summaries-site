    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Many developers become defensive when asked about the undefined and unwritten portion of the BIP process, which is who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core. This seems to be based on personalities rather than any definable process. The incentive for new developers to come in is that they will be paid by companies who want to influence the code, which should be considered. The lead developer is a significant decider, but nobody wants to fully define the process, leaving a broken, unwritten/unspoken process. This type of thing may work with a small group of developers, but businesses/investors looking from outside will see this as a risk. Until all personality-based arguments are resolved, defining a real process will be difficult. Raystonn from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list raised the question and wished to start a civil discussion on it.</p>
