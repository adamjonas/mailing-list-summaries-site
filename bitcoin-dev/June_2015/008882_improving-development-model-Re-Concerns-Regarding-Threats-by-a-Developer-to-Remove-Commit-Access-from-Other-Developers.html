    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the topic of lobbying for 20MB blocks in Bitcoin is discussed. The question of whether or not payments were accepted from companies to lobby for these blocks is raised, as well as if it is appropriate to publicly disclose such information. The discussion then moves towards the prioritization of user rights versus company interests in Bitcoin. It is ultimately agreed upon that user rights should be the primary focus and businesses should provide service to users rather than enforcing their own interests. However, one participant in the conversation holds a differing opinion and believes that the only incentive for developers (other than increasing the value of coins they hold) is to lobby for changes that will benefit the companies that fund them. They argue that this is necessary in order to get more full-time developers on board and to create products and services that people want. This person also disagrees with the notion of a "social contract" and "strong user ethos" in Bitcoin, believing that most potential users do not prioritize these values.</p>
