        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has completed its move to the Linux Foundation, and the previous archive has been fully imported. However, there may be a delay of 5+ minutes for the first post due to Greylisting. The Linux Foundation plans to upgrade Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains. They will also make some config tweaks, including auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. While auto-rejecting spam is deemed too dangerous, those messages will go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse.Warren Togami Jr. made the announcement on June 22, 2015, stating that the move to the new list, bitcoin-dev, was complete. The previous archive has been fully imported, and new posts will now be saved. However, the first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to greylisting. Warren Togami Jr. also mentioned that LF will be upgrading Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains. There will be a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. It is too dangerous to auto-reject spam because those messages need to go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse.Regarding the updating of bitcoin.org and other related forums, Jonas Schnelli inquired about it after the successful move to a new archive. Wladimir responded with links to pull requests on Github for updating these platforms. However, he mentioned that the bitcoin.org page still needed some tweaking.Overall, the context provides updates on the completion of the move of the bitcoin-dev mailing list archives and upcoming improvements to the Mailman system. Additionally, there is discussion about the need for updating bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org.</p>
