    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2015, Gregory Maxwell asked about the status of BIP-drafts related to Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors and Order-based Smart Property Coloring. Fellow Traveler had been waiting for nine months for progress on these proposals and there seemed to be no discussion or activity on them. Maxwell searched his email and the mailing list archives but found nothing. The only two proposals that were sent were attached to a post on Sourceforge. The rest of the proposals in the repository at Open-Transactions/rfc and Monetas/rfc were never submitted because alternative identifiers were used instead of BIP numbers. There was a PGP signature at the end of the email.</p>
