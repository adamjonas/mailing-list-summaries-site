    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent email exchange between Bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and Eric Lombrozo highlighted growing concerns over the limitations of Bitcoin's capacity for transactions, with the prospect that some users may find their bitcoin savings becoming uneconomic to spend. Hearn suggested that if Bitcoin does not have sufficient capacity for every transaction, some users will be kicked out to make way for others. Lombrozo argued that "many of us run end user facing services...and would rather see a fundamental problem fixed rather than merely covered up temporarily hoping nobody notices." Lombrozo went on to highlight several issues with Bitcoin's protocol, including the "send and forget" fee model, which he described as just one of many serious issues with the system.</p>
