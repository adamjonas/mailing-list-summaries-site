    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is suggesting that a formalized or written process should be established for the stakeholders to work with and help keep people on track. The current process is not formalized and no one can provide a clear description of it. Once the process is written down, improvements can be proposed. A risk study had been developed by the Foundation as a first step and a NIST guide for developing such a document is available. It would require buy-in from several different people with expertise in technical areas and test plans.The BIP process has remained unchanged since its adaptation from the Python Enhancement Proposals by Amir Taaki and is not specifically adapted to Bitcoin. Wladimir suggests that someone who is enthusiastic about improving the process should make a proposal for a better process and post it to the list.</p>
