    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Pieter Wuille expressed uncertainty on whether PoP (Proof of Payment) can be supported with CoinJoin. Kalle Rosenbaum explained that the problem is assuming a transaction corresponds to a single payment, which is not compatible with CoinJoin or systems that combine multiple payments in a single transaction. When asked about the possibility of claiming someone else's payment, Wuille stated that the pop includes a nonce randomly generated by the server, which makes it difficult for anyone to reuse a pop unless they are very lucky. However, Rosenbaum questioned why only 48 bits were used when 128 or 256 bits would be more secure.Wuille questioned why identities needed to be assigned to payers and suggested that receivers should not care who paid or how but what was paid for. He proposed that an extension to the payment protocol that gives a token in return for paying, and knowledge of that token is used to access services, would be the easiest solution.</p>
