    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the decentralization of Bitcoin. While having more independent people in control is considered more decentralized, Bitcoin has become worse in terms of decentralization as the number of full nodes that matter for block selection has decreased significantly. The percentage of the community that mines is irrelevant; rather, it's the absolute number of independent people that matters. However, some believe that usage does matter and would prefer a coin with power concentrated in a smaller elite but has overall more usage. The discussion reminds the author of old desktop Linux/free software debates.</p>
