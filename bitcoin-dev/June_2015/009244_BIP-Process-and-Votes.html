    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A concern has been raised about the development of a new FAQ for Bitcoin, as it is likely to be controlled by the same small group that currently controls the GitHub. The issue with this is that the FAQ may present unrealistic claims about how Bitcoin works, similar to those found on the Bitcoin wiki. While the wiki does contain valuable information, there are also a number of incorrect and cult-like claims. Tim Swanson has made videos exposing some of the misinformation that frequently gets repeated on the Wiki and other places.There have been suggestions to reevaluate the information on the Wiki and move it to Bitcoin.org, but the developers did not approve of this idea. Attempts to edit the Wiki often lead to articles being defaced by the maintainers, making it a waste of time. Adam Back proposed the creation of a second mailing list, bitcoin-process, which would serve as a platform for people to learn about the Bitcoin process. Additionally, he suggested the creation of an FAQ on the sign-up page to help people understand how and why Bitcoin works the way it does.</p>
