    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 14, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. suggested creating a new mailing list for Bitcoin development and moving away from SourceForge mailing lists. The community welcomed the idea with some suggestions such as researching secure mailing list models for bitcoin-security but agreed that it should not be a precondition for moving the public bitcoin-dev list. The group also discussed choosing a name for the new list, agreeing on a cut-off date for the old list, and identifying moderators. In addition to the discussion about the mailing list, the post also referenced Gittorrent, a decentralized alternative to GitHub, which was announced in May 2015. The post included links to further resources about both Gittorrent and the proposed mailing list changes.</p>
