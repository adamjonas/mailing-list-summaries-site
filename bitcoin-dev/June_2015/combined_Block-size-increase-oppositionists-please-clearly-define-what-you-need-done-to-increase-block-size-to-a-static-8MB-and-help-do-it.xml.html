        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion in this context revolves around the need to increase the block size of Bitcoin to a static 8MB and the importance of consensus in achieving this. The author argues that the cost of adding transactions to blocks will approach zero, but miners will still need to charge fees to stay in business, using an analogy of an engineer building planes with increasing capacity. The community is urged to run necessary tests and agree on future increases in block size as technology allows. However, concerns are raised about exclusion from testnet and mainnet participants and compromising diversity and decentralization if the block size is increased to 8MB. To address this, testing at double capacity (2MB) is suggested as a potential solution. Nonetheless, questions are raised about scaling beyond that and the purpose of such an increase. Peter Todd contributed to the conversation, pointing out that the proposed plan only doubled the capacity with no clear path for scaling further. It is argued that simply increasing capacity along with hardware could be a solution, but the question of why bother doubling capacity if there is no clear way to scale beyond that remains. A post on the Bitcoin development mailing list argues that the 1MB block size limit in Bitcoin is arbitrary and doesn't represent any technical or economic sweet spot. The post suggests that unless specific use cases are put forward explaining how an increase in block size would marginalize them, then 8MB should be considered the minimum applicable size for raising the block size from a network propagation point of view. It is also suggested that a real discussion needs to be had about finding the right sweet spot for block size and that it may even be the case that 1MB is too big. In addition, the post argues that increasing the block size has a greater chance of creating a fee market after coinbase subsidies decline. Overall, the message is to prioritize the growth and expansion of Bitcoin for the benefit of its users and the market demand for increased capacity while considering the potential impact on diversity and decentralization. The community is urged to work together to find a solution that balances these factors and allows for sustainable scaling of the network.</p>
