    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message dated June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen announced that he had written a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) outlining the increase in maximum block size. He provided a link to the proposal on GitHub, where it is still available as of August 2021. Andresen's proposal noted that testing the impact of an 8MB limit was important and suggested that the switch over date for testnet be set in the past to allow for realistic testing. He recommended using August 1st, 2013, which would require creating a full-load blockchain on testnet via reorg to fully test the real-world behavior of the entire infrastructure ecosystem. While this would be inconvenient due to the amount of data involved, Andresen argued that the potential impact on the $3.5 billion market cap made such testing necessary.</p>
