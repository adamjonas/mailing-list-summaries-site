    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread between Tom Harding and Pieter Wuille discusses the effects of block size on centralization pressure in the Bitcoin system. The main issue, however, is not the block size but rather the connectivity of nodes in countries with unfriendly internet policies and deceptive connectivity. Jonas Nick argues that Pieter's scenario is the result of a long-term network partition rather than a cartel. Tom runs a simulation with a large miner in a minority partition and 16 small miners in a majority partition, and concludes that making small blocks when others are making big ones is bad, being separated by a slow link from majority hash power is bad, but being a small miner with a block size of 20MB is not bad. The configuration details and results of Tom's simulation are provided in the email. The email is signed off by Yifu Guo.</p>
