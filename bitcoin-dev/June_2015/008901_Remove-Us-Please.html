    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In October 2014, Gigas Gaming decided to launch its own cryptocurrency after researching and testing various crypto currencies. They had built their own coin for testing purposes called GigasCorpCoin and found the underlying problem of Bitcoin, which they were poised to solve. The company was planning to hire an expert to do some of the coding by October 14, 2015. However, on June 19, 2015, Jameson Lopp interrupted the companyâ€™s work by sending emails to their mailing list, prompting Gigas Gaming to ask him to remove their email from his list as it was interfering with official company business.</p>
