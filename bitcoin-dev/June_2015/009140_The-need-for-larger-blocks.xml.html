    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email dated 6/27/2015 at 10:43 AM, Wladimir J. van der Laan expressed his disappointment and concern over political pressure tactics being used to change a distributed consensus system. However, some people suggest formalizing the process of dealing with such pressure in the open. He argued that the block size is not like gravity which cannot be changed as per the needs of some groups. Rather, it is similar to limiting planes' wingspan to the most typical hangar door of 1940. This has caused controversy as modern planes may not fit into old hangars. Some are even questioning why bother making larger jets at all when the demand for flight is essentially limitless.</p>
