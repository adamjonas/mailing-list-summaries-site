    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker made a statement about the equation for miners having multiple variables, which was in response to being called out on his previous statement that seemed to suggest only those producing large blocks were being punished. He clarified that the orphan rate increase would go to whoever produced the 20MB block, not necessarily the individual miner. The speaker also mentioned that there is no disadvantage if the network speed is the same between miners, however, this assumption may not hold true in all situations.</p>
