    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the lack of trust in the Github process and how some developers oppose change. The author argues that even after addressing concerns, someone has to decide whether or not to commit changes to the official release. They believe the current system is too centralized with one person making all the decisions, and a more democratic process is needed. The author also criticizes the dictatorial style of the developers in charge, who shut out many stakeholders instead of soliciting their opinions. They view the Github system as the biggest centralized choke-point in Bitcoin and its biggest threat to continued survival. Additionally, the author notes that some Core developers have called them a "troll" and tell others to ignore their messages, causing some to drop out of the Github discussions. Finally, the author believes that anyone can come in and hire a couple of core developers to veto any change they don't want, making the system vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
