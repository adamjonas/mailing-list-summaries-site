    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The footer has been removed from the mailing list due to its incompatibility with DKIM signing. The "[Bitcoin-dev] " prepend tag in subject can only be compatible with DKIM header signing if manually added by the poster. However, footers are still being added to the list by SourceForge. The best solution is to use a mailing list operator that operates correctly with DKIM/DMARC and does not modify messages in transit or re-sends them under their own identity. The latter approach is risky as it puts the responsibility of spamming on the list operator, leading to a degraded reputation if the server is hacked or spammers post to the lists themselves. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that everyone's mail does not go to the spam folder.</p>
