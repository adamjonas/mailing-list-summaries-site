    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Venzen Khaosan and Aaron Voisine discusses the concept of Bitcoin's exchange rate as a commodity money floating freely in the market, its fundamental value, properties, and degree of decentralization. Venzen argues that Bitcoin's fundamental value relies on its degree of decentralization to remain true and retain its meaning and value. However, Aaron believes that adoption as a store-of-value must increase the market price given the restricted and eventually fixed supply. He also highlights the importance of how many other people standardize on the same money and want to hold it to drive its price in terms of other commodities. The conversation concludes with the need for scaling to safeguard Bitcoin's fundamental value and implement protections that ensure quality of decentralization.</p>
