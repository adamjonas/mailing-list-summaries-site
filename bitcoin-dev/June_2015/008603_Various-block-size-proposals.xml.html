    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are various proposals regarding the minimum block size questions and other related scalability issues in the Bitcoin development community. These proposals include a dynamic block size limit controller by maaku, increasing the max block size using a soft-fork by Tier Nolan, elastic block cap with rollover penalties by Meni Rosenfield, variable mining effort by gmaxwell, BIP100 soft-fork limit of 2 MB by jgarzik, transaction fee targeting, difficulty target scaling, annual 50% max block size increase, and various algorithmic adjustment proposals.Other proposals include extension blocks by Adam Back, voting by paying to an address or fees, double the max block size at each block reward halving, reducing the block rate instead of increasing the maximum block size by Sergio Lerner, decrease block interval, increase default soft block size limit in Bitcoin Core, consider the size of the utxo set when determining max block size, reduce and decrease the max block size, change the value of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE in Bitcoin Core, and problems with floating block size limits by petertodd. Developers have also proposed other ways to support high transaction volumes such as simplified payment verification, lightning network, GHOST, payment channels, and tree chains. However, some proposals have limitations such as vote censorship and utxo depth which cannot have consensus. Furthermore, old Bitcoin-development and Bitcointalk proposals are missing from this list.</p>
