    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is a response to a person named Adam regarding questions that were sent to a mailing list. The author explains that they would have been happy to reply in private if asked. They mention that they are on the bitcoin-security list and have taken part in many threads there. Gavin is working on a BIP to go along with his patch, but the author does not expect the resulting discussion to differ much from the discussion so far. The author states that they would not attend a summit because no progress was ever made at Bitcoin conferences where the block size issue was discussed. If there was a specific problem with the code, the author would fix it. Finally, the author addresses the criticism of anyone who agrees with non-programmers Mike & Gavin by saying that anyone can write blogs and encourages them to show the error of their ways.</p>
