    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread consists of a list of questions that Sven Berg, from Berg Investigations LLC, wants answered. He asks about the number of hours per week for each project, upfront and ongoing fees, total amounts for each project, start and end dates, current and past holdings of altcoins/appcoins including liquidation dates, return on investment to investors related to activities during employment not including marketing/price pump, involvement with Initial Coin Offers (ICO) of applicable, and explanation for pursuit of ICO fund sources rather than community/established businesses like Lighthouse or legit startups. The email also includes a request to take this discussion elsewhere as it is not relevant to the business of those on the list.</p>
