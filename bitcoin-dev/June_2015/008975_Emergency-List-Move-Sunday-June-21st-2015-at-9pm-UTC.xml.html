    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Due to the explosion of the Sourceforge list server which caused the majority of the old list to be unsubscribed, a new list move was planned. The old list will be permanently shut down with auto-reject on all posts at 9pm UTC or 2pm PDT. To continue receiving updates, users are advised to subscribe to the new list at <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev</a>. The new list will be opened for posts shortly after 9pm UTC following the final archive import. Users are also advised not to panic if their post does not immediately reach the new list as the first post may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to greylisting. For any questions or concerns, users can chat in Freenode #bitcoin-dev. The announcement was made by Warren Togami.</p>
