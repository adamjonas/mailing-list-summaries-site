    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has completed its move and the previous archive has been fully imported. However, users may experience a delay of 5+ minutes for their first post due to Greylisting. The Linux Foundation (LF) plans to upgrade Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains. Additionally, there will be some more config tweaks, such as auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. Nobody has time to moderate this list and mail disappearing into the moderation hold blackhole is worse than an instant reject message telling people to subscribe. Unfortunately, auto-rejecting spam is too dangerous and thus those messages need to go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse. If you have any questions or concerns, contact Freenode #bitcoin-dev. The announcement was made by Warren Togami.</p>
