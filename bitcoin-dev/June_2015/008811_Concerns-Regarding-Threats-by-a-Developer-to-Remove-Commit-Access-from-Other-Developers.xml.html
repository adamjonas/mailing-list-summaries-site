    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Alex Morcos proposed the idea of conducting a poll to measure the level of agreement on increasing the block size before deploying it. He suggested four kinds of polls: miners voting in coinbases, known corporate entities announcing their votes, a poll on whether Bitcoin Foundation infrastructure still exists to represent an authenticated set of individuals, and a Reddit poll. Gavin Andresen agreed that a clear super-majority of people and businesses using Bitcoin the most should be the criteria for any change in consensus rules. He also wondered if successful open-source projects had either a Benevolent Dictator or a clear voting process to resolve disputes that cannot be settled by rough consensus.</p>
