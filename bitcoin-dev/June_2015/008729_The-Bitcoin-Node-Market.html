    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2015, Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com, responded to a proposal that punishing users who use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets is not an ideal way to incentivize people to run full nodes. He mentioned that SPV wallet authors would be the ones to provide the nodes that mobile phones need to connect to, if they want their wallet to function. He also countered the idea that paying for connectivity would be more confusing or annoying than transaction fees are. Voisine suggested that if some full nodes in the network started offering paid connection slots, users who checked the "pay subscription fee" box in their wallet configuration would have an easier time connecting than those who did not.</p>
