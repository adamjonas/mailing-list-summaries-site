    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of using a token in the coinbase input script to indicate support for larger blocks in Bitcoin. The idea is to avoid centralization of control over block size limits in the hands of large mining pools. However, there is also the suggestion that omitting any indication should be an implicit vote for the status quo. The proposal has been discussed before but was deemed risky due to the potential for miners to want larger blocks than the rest of the network could bear. The conversation among the participants on #bitcoin-wizards led to the conclusion that a hard upper limit of 20 MB should still be in place, and simply changing the upper limit might be simpler and better. While there is no explicit need to put the token in the header, it could be useful to dynamically increase a lower limit. There are already many uses for the scriptSig, including block height, merged mining hash, P2SH, and miner identifier. Voting to keep the block size the same by not voting is also an option.</p>
