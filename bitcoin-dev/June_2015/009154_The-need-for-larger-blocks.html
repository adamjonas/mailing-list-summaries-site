    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on June 27th, 2015 at 3:18 PM, Greg Sanders asks if it is possible to agree that n-1 dev Nacks would be a controversial hard fork. The statement implies that not all developers are perfectly representing the whole community, and there could be some shady lobbying going on behind the scenes.The discussion seems to revolve around the concept of a hard fork in the cryptocurrency world, where a permanent split occurs in the blockchain due to a major change in the protocol. In this case, n-1 dev Nacks refers to a situation where one developer disagrees with a proposed change, leading to a potential split in the blockchain.However, the email suggests that such a scenario is controversial and may not be representative of the entire community's opinion. It raises concerns about the possibility of lobbying or hidden agendas influencing the decision-making process.Overall, the email conversation highlights the challenges and complexities involved in making significant changes to a blockchain protocol, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in the decision-making process to ensure that the interests of the entire community are adequately represented.</p>
