    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is an email conversation between two individuals, with the initial email asking for an apology and a response from Mike Hearn. The initial email expresses the opinion that Hearn should apologize for what he has said as it is seen as an attack on a community. If he refuses to do so, he should step back and let others come to a consensus on how bitcoin is run. Hearn's response argues that maintainers have to take part in debates to make decisions, which is consistent with his previous position. He maintains that Core is in a weird position because there's no decision-making ability at all, and anyone who shows up and shouts enough can generate "controversy." Hearn believes that this anti-process leads to no decision making.The email also includes links to Hearn's website and Keybase page.</p>
