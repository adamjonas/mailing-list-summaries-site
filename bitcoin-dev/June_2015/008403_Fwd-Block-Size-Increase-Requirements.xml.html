    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the mining situation in China, Mike Hearn suggested that if Chinese miners cannot get the required bandwidth through their firewall and are outcompeted, then it is too bad. However, he also added that they could always run a node on a server in Taiwan and connect to it via a VPN. The response from an anonymous poster criticized Mike for being ignorant of the current situation and stated that if Western miners do not find a China-based VPN or improve their connectivity to China, they would have higher orphans than Chinese miners who currently have a majority stake in mining.</p>
