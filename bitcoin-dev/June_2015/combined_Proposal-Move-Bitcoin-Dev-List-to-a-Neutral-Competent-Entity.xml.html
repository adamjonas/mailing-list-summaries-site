        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread, Pieter suggested that new admins should be able to import mbox archives of the list from SF to keep archive consistency in one place. Meanwhile, Warren Togami Jr. supported the proposal of moving bitcoin-dev mailing list to Linux Foundation (LF) since the latter is "neutral" and seems to be a competent host. However, he also pointed out that LF is a trade organization that acts in the commercial interest of its membership. Nonetheless, he believed that LF's membership's interests are not at odds with bitcoin-dev's currently and likely will not become so in the future. Togami also mentioned that it would not be wise to delete the SF account while there are still active links to it, as it might be recreated to mirror things as a service to those following the old links. Jeff's comments on bitcoin-security were also agreed upon by Togami.</p>
