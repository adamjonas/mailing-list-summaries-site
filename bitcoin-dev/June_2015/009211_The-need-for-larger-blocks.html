    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Ivan Brightly and Jorge Tim贸n, the topic of majority rule versus minority rights in Bitcoin was discussed. Tim贸n asserted that the majority shouldn't dictate to the minority, but Brightly disagreed, stating that Bitcoin doesn't provide any inherent rights, only the choice to participate or not. Tim贸n agreed with Brightly's point, saying that without built-in rights, the majority cannot dictate anything. The philosophical question of majority rule versus minority rights in Bitcoin was touched upon, but ultimately, it was concluded that Bitcoin does not provide any inherent rights.</p>
