    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Wladimir J. van der Laan, the decision-making process of open source projects was discussed in relation to Bitcoin Core. Wuille suggested looking at the changelog for version 0.11 or following pull requests to see how many decisions are made on a daily basis. He also noted that people have the right to fork Bitcoin Core if they disagree with changes made or not made. However, consensus changes, especially hardforks, are more difficult as they require users to migrate to a new system with new rules that may be incompatible with the old one. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, added that changing Bitcoin's rules is not like other open source software as it changes Bitcoin's constitution, which everyone in the system is forced to follow or be ignored by the system.</p>
