    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 14, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. proposed the name for a new list related to bitcoin development. He suggested using 'bitcoin-development' or 'bitcoin-dev.' The group decided to go with the shorter name and requested creation of the list. They also discussed a cut-off date for the old list, suggesting July 15th as a deadline. However, some members suggested a shorter cut-off time of one week after the new list was announced to avoid upsetting people. The group also agreed not to auto-subscribe everyone to the new list. There was a question about subscribing the old list to the new one and whether Mailman could prevent double-posts if someone wrote to both the old and new address.</p>
