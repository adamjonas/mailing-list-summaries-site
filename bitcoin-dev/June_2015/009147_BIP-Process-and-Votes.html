    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Milly Bitcoin expressed her opinion about the Github process for making changes to Bitcoin. She stated that while some developers believe that Github is the only place that matters and that only a select group of insiders' opinions matter, she does not share this view. Milly Bitcoin also noted that there will always be someone who opposes any change made to Bitcoin. She cited an example of a Github discussion between a few people and Garzik tweeting about near-universal approval for a proposed change, which she found suspicious due to the dictatorial style of the developers in charge of the Github process. Milly Bitcoin also claimed that the Github system is the biggest centralized choke-point in Bitcoin and a threat to its continued survival, as anyone can come in and hire core developers to veto any change they do not want. However, it was noted that Bitcoin core developers do not decide hardfork changes and that softfork changes have been made because they are considered uncontroversial, not due to any centralized negotiating table or voting process to decide when to force every user to adapt their software to new consensus rules.</p>
