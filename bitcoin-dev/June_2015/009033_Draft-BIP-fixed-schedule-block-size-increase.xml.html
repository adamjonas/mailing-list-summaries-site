    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen, it was discussed that miners with bad connectivity are negatively affected by other miners creating larger blocks. However, this effect is only significant if they have an extremely low-bandwidth connection and do nothing to work around it. Factors such as location, electricity cost, and profitability equations play a role in decentralization of mining. While block propagation improvements have been implemented, co-operation is required for their success. Worst-case scenarios need to be considered for safety engineering analysis. The need for the proposal to explicitly talk about what kind of resources are needed by miners for profitability, including the case where other miners are sabotaging their profitability was also highlighted. Peter Todd was accused of Gish Gallop and moving the goalposts. Todd had written about the resources needed to run a full node, but there was no answer from Andresen on how much is too much.</p>
