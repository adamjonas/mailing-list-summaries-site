    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the need for global awareness in Bitcoin transactions and the importance of Bitcoin Core being the hub at the center. The author suggests thorough testing of any proposed change in the maximum block size before increasing it to 8 MB, with the possibility of adjusting it further in the future as technology permits. Evan has suggested that Huobi would require around three months of testing on a test-net, which should begin in early-mid October. The author offers to host a face-to-face meeting in Hong Kong on October 14-15 to discuss the results of the testing process and engineer any remaining ones necessary to raise the level of confidence to help 'mine consensus' for any hard fork. Anyone willing to contribute resources to participate in the design, execution, and analysis of such testing is invited to post to the thread.</p>
