        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The BIP66 soft-fork has passed the 75% support threshold, indicating that 75% of the hashing power has upgraded to support it while 25% of the power has not. Once the hashing power reaches 95%, blocks created by the remaining 5% who have not upgraded will be rejected. It is important for those who operate a pool, solo-mine, or mine on p2pool to upgrade their Bitcoin Core node to support the BIP66 soft-fork; otherwise, their blocks will be rejected. Miners who have upgraded set the version field in their blocks to 3, while non-upgraded miners set it to 2 to measure BIP66 support.After reaching a 75% threshold, miners who haven't updated their version can be attacked through the creation of invalid blocks. This happens when someone produces a version 3 block that violates new rules and miners who haven't upgraded waste their mining power building on that block which could be an expensive way to attack them. The risk of this happening is low since creating an invalid version 3 block costs 25BTC in hashing power and the miner who does it ends up creating an invalid block.An email conversation between Tier Nolan and Pieter discusses the importance of updating miners to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. According to Tier Nolan, once the 75% threshold is reached, miners who have not updated their systems are at risk of mining on invalid blocks. Pieter adds that they have been above the 75% threshold since June 7th, which was before Peter's main was sent.</p>
