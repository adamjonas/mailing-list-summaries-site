    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have planned and deployed the infrastructure for a Bitcoin hard-fork, despite majority opposition. Venzen Khaosan has written an open letter imploring them to cease their activity of a unilateral hard-fork immediately. The letter stated that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen do not own Bitcoin and cannot have it. Their hard-fork is tantamount to theft and they and their collaborators will effectively ex-communicate themselves from this project and community.The work splits between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, with Gavin writing the code and a BIP as well. Mike Hearn will review both and mostly delegate to Gavin's good taste around the details unless there is some very strong disagreement. If Bitcoin runs out of capacity it will break, and many of our users will leave. This is not an acceptable outcome for myself or the many other wallet, service and merchant developers who have worked for years to build an ecosystem around this protocol.BitcoinXT is not going to fork the chain on a specific date no matter what. People will be able to vote via block versions and once a sufficient majority supports the extensions everyone else will have a grace period to upgrade. Only after that is a very small minority at risk of losing money. Bitcoin is a Free and Open Source Software project that serves as flagship for the blockchain. There is protocol for how change is effected in a FOSS project. For the sake of everything that is good and useful in Bitcoin, reconsider your dangerous plan and its intended and unintended consequences.In conclusion, it is important to come to a solution that everyone agrees on, and permissionless innovation is one of bitcoin's virtues. In the end, adoption will decide what bitcoin is and isn't.The context provided is a mailing list called Bitcoin-development that can be subscribed to at lists.sourceforge.net. The purpose of this mailing list is unclear and there is no information on the content that is shared or discussed among its members. There is also no indication of how frequently the list is used or how many subscribers it has. The only available link is to the subscription page for the mailing list.</p>
