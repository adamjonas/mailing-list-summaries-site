        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the potential for a majority of mining hash rate to perform double spending attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which would ultimately result in the failure and abandonment of the Bitcoin experiment. The basic assumption behind Bitcoin is that only a minority of actors are dishonest, and if the majority are, then Satoshi's scheme does not work. This fact has been known since day one and is outlined in the white paper. If the majority of the hashrate can perform double spends on a chain, they can send Bitcoins to exchanges, sell them, extract the money and build a new longer chain to get their Bitcoins back. In essence, this would render the Bitcoin experiment a failure.In an email exchange from 2015, Mike Hearn expressed concern over the fact that a majority of the Bitcoin mining hash rate could perform double spend attacks on exchanges by selling bitcoins for cash, extracting the money, and then building a longer chain to get their bitcoins back. However, it was noted that the basic assumption behind Bitcoin is that only a minority of actors are dishonest, as stated in the white paper. It was also suggested that it is possible for agents to commit to honesty on a chain they support and dishonesty on a chain they oppose. Majority hashpower doesn't need to be dishonest to stop a change to large blocks, but can simply refuse to build on blocks that it doesn't like. The minority would not mine blocks larger than 1MB if they knew they would be orphaned.</p>
