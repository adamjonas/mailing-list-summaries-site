    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread from June 1, 2015, several members of the Bitcoin development mailing list expressed their desire for a summary of the ongoing block size debate. Mats Henricson urged posters to read up on all the information before posting and to be helpful by suggesting alternatives, not just criticizing. Gabe Appleton suggested creating a wiki page to condense the information and offered to help if the page was approved. Ethan Heilman also seconded the idea of a summary, citing the large number of emails generated every day from the debate. However, the original poster noted that they did not have permission to create a page but would happily assist if someone else did.</p>
