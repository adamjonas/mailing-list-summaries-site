    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of this email conversation revolves around the proposed fork of the protocol. One of the concerns mentioned was how personal ownership would be dealt with during the time when the unilateral hard-fork is deployed and being in sole maintainership control. The writer hopes that whoever wishes to fork the protocol will reconsider and test their reputation, skills, and resources before doing so. They believe that it is non-trivial to hard-fork successfully and may not be within a single developer's talents to manage the process start-to-finish. It was suggested that Adam's questions should be responded in-line by Mike. Bryan Bishop expressed concern about the level of care taken with reading and (mis)interpreting Adam's messages, as this could have catastrophic consequences in the context of Bitcoin. He encouraged everyone to evaluate messages and source code more carefully, especially when evaluating consensus changes.</p>
