    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 25, 2015, Peter Todd proposed the deployment of Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV) considering its benefits to scalability solutions. He suggested using the existing median block version mechanism for CLTV as it is well-tested and understood. Todd stated that there is no lack of consensus on this proposal. He further added that if another soft-fork is proposed prior to BIP65 enforcement, they have the option of setting in motion yet another soft-fork as the median mechanism only requires forks to be serialized in sequence. The CLTV code has been extensively reviewed in the form of the "mempool-only" pull-req, has been included in the Elements sidechain prototype by Mark Friedenbach, has been running in production on Viacoin for six months, and has a few working demos of its functionality implemented.</p>
