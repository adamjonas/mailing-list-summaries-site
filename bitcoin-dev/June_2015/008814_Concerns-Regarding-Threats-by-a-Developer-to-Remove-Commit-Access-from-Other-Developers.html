    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo, a technical person in the Bitcoin community, expressed objection to the idea that anyone would base their decision on block size issues based on their own personal network. He believes that this is not a serious motivating factor for anyone and that it's important to pay attention to trends and broadband distribution in the US and other parts of the world, as well as one's own connectivity. He suggests that communication is difficult but it's a shared responsibility, and there's no need to assume that anyone isn't reading.</p>
