    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 19, 2015, Gavin Andresen sent an email to F2Pool expressing his disappointment in Peter Todd's claim that the pool will run his replace-by-fee patch. He strongly encouraged them to wait until most wallet software supports replace-by-fee before implementing it because until then, it would make it easier to steal from bitcoin-accepting merchants. In response, F2Pool asked if he meant just full-RBF or FSS-RBF as well. The conversation then shifted to whether Coinbase was trying to get hashing power contracts with mining pools for guaranteed transaction acceptance. Peter Todd expressed concern and requested confirmation from Coinbase, as Gavin Andresen was still an advisor to them. He also welcomed any other Coinbase representative to chime in on the matter.</p>
