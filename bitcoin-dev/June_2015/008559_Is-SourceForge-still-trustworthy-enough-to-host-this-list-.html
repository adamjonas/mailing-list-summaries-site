    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Andy Schroder suggests that the enigmail extension may not be working as expected. He says that the recent email messages sent by him are validly signed and that PGP/MIME does support partially signed content. However, he also wonders if mailing list re-writing parts of the messages is causing issues with PGP/MIME. Peter Todd, who responded to the email thread, confirms that PGP/MIME does support partially signed content. The email thread includes a digital signature attachment from Peter Todd.</p>
