    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn had tried for several months to add a small "API" to Bitcoin Core, but in the end it was a waste of time. He had to fork Bitcoin to get it out there. Despite some members suggesting he use blockchain.info instead, he persevered and his approach has been working fine for months. However, Pieter clarifies that querying spentness of particular outputs is fundamentally unprovable data in Bitcoin as is. The choice is between querying a central service or trusting something a random peer on the internet tells you. Decentralization exists to remove central points of failure and reduce trust. If trustless querying of spentness is desired in the future, help working on one of the several TXO commitment ideas to get them implemented.</p>
