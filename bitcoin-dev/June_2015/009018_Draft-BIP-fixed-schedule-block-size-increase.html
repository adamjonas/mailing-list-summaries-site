    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email from Gavin Andresen on June 22, 2015, he discusses the implementation of rules for Bitcoin blocks. He notes that keeping the number of rules that require context to a minimum is important and suggests using only the timestamp of the block to determine the block limit. This would simplify implementation and make it easier to determine the limit purely from the block header. Andresen does not see much issue with having a 1MB block following an 8MB block during activation, as this is inherent in using timestamps. While it may create a slight incentive to use higher timestamps when fees are the main source of income, this is not likely to be a major concern since it only occurs for two hours out of the two year doubling time.</p>
