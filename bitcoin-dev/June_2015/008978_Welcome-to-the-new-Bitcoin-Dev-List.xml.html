    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context begins with an acknowledgement that everything is fine. The writer then asks if all the archives have been imported and offers to provide a mirror for the mail list archives. Warren Togami Jr. announces in an email sent on 6/22/2015 that the move has been completed, and the previous archive has been fully imported and new posts will now be saved. He also notifies the readers that their first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to greylisting and provides his contact information in case anyone has any questions or concerns. Warren Togami Jr. also shares some TODOs including upgrading Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM enforced domains and making a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting non-subscribed posts. However, he clarifies that it is too dangerous to auto-reject spam as those messages need to go into a blackhole to prevent bounce abuse. Overall, the email notification is about the completion of the move of the bitcoin-dev mailing list archives and the implementation of some changes to the Mailman system to better handle posts.</p>
