    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion regarding the hosting of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on SourceForge has been ongoing for some time, with concerns over the website's continued hosting of the list. There have been suggestions to move the list to a neutral and competent entity, as it would be politically awkward for any of the existing Bitcoin companies or organisations to host due to the perceived political control. A proposed action plan includes discussing the matter within the community, importing the entire list archive into a new host's archives for user convenience, and deleting the entire Bitcoin SourceForge project. The subscriber list's auto-importing is deemed an issue that could upset people. It has also been suggested that Google Groups is too controversial to be the replacement host, and the Linux Foundation has been seen as a suitable alternative due to their neutrality and ability to professionally maintain their infrastructure. The list is also archived at bitcoin-development.narkive.com since June 2011.</p>
