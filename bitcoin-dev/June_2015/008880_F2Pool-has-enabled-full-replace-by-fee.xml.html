    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 19, 2015, Chun Wang wrote about how he performed probably the only successful bitcoin double spend in the March 2013 fork without any mining power. He knew how bad the full RBF was and that F2Pool would switch to FSS RBF in a few hours. Peter Todd replied to Stephen Morse that first-seen-safe replace-by-fee is also available. In addition, Todd explained the differences between standard and zeroconf versions of replace-by-fee patch. For the purpose of increasing fees, RBF is something like %50 cheaper than CPFP, and FSS-RBF is something like %25 cheaper. Todd's new FSS-RBF has a number of restrictions such as you can't replace multiple transactions with one, you can't replace a transaction whose outputs have already been spent, you can't replace a transaction with one that spends additional unconfirmed inputs, etc. Todd's previous standard RBF patch can replace multiple transactions with one, can replace long chains of transactions, etc. Todd was worried about a service like Coinbase or Shapeshift coming to rely on zeroconf and then attempting to secure it by gaining control of a majority of hashing power. One of his goals with standard replace-by-fee is to prevent this scenario by forcing merchants and others to implement ways of accepting zeroconf transactions safely that work in a decentralized environment regardless of what miners do. Todd updated his FSS-RBF patch and waited to get some feedback. Suhas Daftuar found a pretty serious bug in it, now fixed. Todd is working on porting it to v0.10.2, and once that's done he's going to put up a bounty for anyone who can find a DoS attack in the patch. If no-one claims the bounty after a week or two Todd thinks he'll start feeling confident about using it in production.</p>
