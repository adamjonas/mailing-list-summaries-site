        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Pieter, a developer, has criticized the idea of using a block version vote as a mechanism for hard forks. He believes that this is a bad idea regardless of the type of hard fork being proposed. The purpose of a hard fork is to ask the whole community to change their full nodes to new code, and the trigger mechanism is used to establish when that has happened. Pieter argues that using a 95% threshold would imply that the fork can happen when at least 5% of miners have not upgraded, which means that some full nodes have not (as miners are nodes) and the old chain can keep growing too, confusing old non-miner nodes as well.Ideally, the fork should be scheduled when there is certainty that nodes will have upgraded, and the risk for a fork will be gone. If everyone has upgraded, no vote is necessary, and if nodes have not, it remains risky to fork them off. Pieter understands that an observable trigger mechanism is needed to keep humans in the loop, and a hashrate vote is an easy way to do this. However, he suggests using a minimum timestamp considered reasonable for upgrade and a 100% threshold afterward.In response to Pieter's suggestion, David Vorick opined that it is unreasonable to expect all nodes to upgrade during a hard fork. He argued that it is possible for an extreme minority of nodes to hold the rest of the network hostage by simply refusing to upgrade. He suggested that nodes should be able to protest until it is clear that they have lost the battle without being at risk of getting hardforked out of the network unexpectedly. Pieter responded by saying that you cannot observe the majority of nodes, only miners, and weighed by hashrate. If a mechanism for protest is needed, it should happen before the hard fork change code is rolled out. Pieter assumed a completely uncontroversial change to avoid confusing the discussion with the debate about what hard forks should be done. He concluded that there is a difference between ignoring old unmaintained nodes that do not influence anyone's behavior and ignoring the nodes that power miners producing actual blocks.</p>
