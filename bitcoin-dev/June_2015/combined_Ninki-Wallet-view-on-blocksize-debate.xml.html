        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion in this context is about how wallets calculate fees that must be paid to miners and whether they adjust automatically when transactions take a long time to be confirmed. The response of wallets when transactions are not mined successfully, such as when blocks are full, is also being discussed. The writer urges Gavin to withdraw from the current standoff and work with the Bitcoin core developers via the existing BIP process. The proposed solution of convincing miners and services to switch to Bitcoin-XT is recognized as done out of urgency, as changes take a long time to roll out and should start before it's too late.The debate is centered around what is more risky: a consensus hard fork or letting Bitcoin exceed its imposed capacity limits. Two potential short-term solutions have been proposed: (1) all miners and wallet developers need to upgrade to support first-safe RBF to allow for double spending one's own transactions when they lack sufficient fees to merit confirmations, or (2) implementing either Gavin's or Jeff Garzik's proposal to change the consensus parameters around the block size limit. Both are dangerous and could result in significant loss of public confidence.Ben, the developer for Ninki Wallet, believes that the block size limit will have to be increased in the future, but not without an established consensus on how bitcoin will scale with decentralization. He does not support any group that attempts to fork the blockchain in the manner proposed using XT and strongly urges Gavin to withdraw from this standoff and work with the bitcoin core devs via the existing and successful bip process. Ninki Wallet has recently been listed on bitcoin.org.</p>
