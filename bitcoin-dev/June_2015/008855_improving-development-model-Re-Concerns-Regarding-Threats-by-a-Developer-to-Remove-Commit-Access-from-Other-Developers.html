    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email chain between Eric Lombrozo and Dr. Adam Back discusses the potential downfall of Bitcoin, stating that even if it were to fail, the ideas behind it are too powerful to be completely forgotten. Lombrozo believes that someone will eventually create a better version of Bitcoin, as first mover advantage and the network effect are overrated. He cites examples such as the Mac coming before the Windows PC and Yahoo! preceding Google as evidence that being the first does not necessarily guarantee success. Lombrozo concludes by saying that there is still much untapped brainpower available to contribute to the development of cryptocurrency, and that Bitcoin may eventually be relegated to the history books and museums while a different network takes its place. The email was sent in June 2015 to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
