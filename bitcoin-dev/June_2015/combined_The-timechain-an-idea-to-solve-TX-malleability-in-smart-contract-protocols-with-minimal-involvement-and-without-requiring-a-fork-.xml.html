        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposed idea is to use time-locked encryption in order to create multi-signature contract schemes. The encryption would involve a serial chain of time-lock encrypted GPG keys at N-minute intervals that encrypt ECDSA keys. The keys would be generated in parallel and stitched together into a chain at five minute intervals, which could be used for refunds in smart contracts instead of nTimeLocked TXs. Additionally, the timechain could be used to build unbreakable DACs, which would pay participants to decrypt itself. This incentivizes the decryption process by paying a small portion of their fees "into" the ECDSA keys. Using the public key for the fee ECDSA key as the IV used to generate the next key on the chain would force participants to reveal their solutions to the decryption of the timechain. However, it should be noted that the integrity of a timechain cannot be known beforehand. Despite this, using time-locked encryption in this manner would allow companies to create entirely secure and reliable systems that could not be hacked without requiring third-parties to manage key-pairs on their web servers. Collateral could even be used as a way to incentivize the reliable construction of the timechain.</p>
