    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Adam Back and Benjamin on the proposed compromise to the block size limit questions the effectiveness of coalescing when multiple unique transactions are sent to different addresses. Benjamin expresses concerns over naive scaling, stating that it will lead to bad outcomes and suggests working incrementally and carefully. He also argues that Level2 and Lightning are not well defined and moving money to a third party within the constraint of a locked contract will not solve the issues. However, Adam disagrees and explains how lightning works. Every lightning transaction is valid bitcoin transaction that could be posted to the Bitcoin network to reclaim funds if a hub went offline permanently. The lightning network has been described as a write coalescing write cache layer for Bitcoin. Adam clarifies that lightning is expected to be peer-to-peer like Bitcoin.</p>
