    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Warren Togami Jr. expresses his support for the proposal of having bitcoin-dev hosted by the Linux Foundation (LF) due to their neutrality and competence in open source development. However, he notes that LF is not a charity but a trade organization serving the commercial interests of its members. He believes that this does not present a problem as the interests of bitcoin-dev and LF's membership are currently aligned. Warren points out that LF has demonstrated considerable competence in this kind of operation and thinks that it would be beneficial to have their support. Warren clarifies that while the 'foundation' name may carry the misconception of being a charity, the stakes of this matter are small enough that it doesn't require a careful weighing of interests. He also mentions that it may not be wise to delete the SF account while many active links still exist, as it might be recreated to mirror things as a service to those following the old links. Finally, Warren agrees with Jeff's comments regarding bitcoin-security.</p>
