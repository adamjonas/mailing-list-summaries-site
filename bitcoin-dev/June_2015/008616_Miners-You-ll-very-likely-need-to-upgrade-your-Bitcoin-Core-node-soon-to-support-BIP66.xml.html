    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Tier Nolan and Pieter is regarding the update of miners in mining on invalid blocks. According to Tier Nolan, once the 75% threshold is reached, miners who have not updated their systems are at risk of mining on invalid blocks. Pieter adds that they have been above the 75% threshold since June 7th, which was before Peter's main was sent. It seems that the update of miners is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.</p>
