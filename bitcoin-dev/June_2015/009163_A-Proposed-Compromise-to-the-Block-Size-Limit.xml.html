    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Peter Todd was advised to set up an 8MB testnet as a way of testing the performance characteristics of 8MB+ blocks. It was suggested that this would make it seem more reasonable to move forward with full RBF for mining pools. However, Todd responded that it was not a reasonable path forward at the time due to the lack of testing done with large blocks and other problems. This email exchange was dated 6/27/15 at 11:21 AM and was between Todd and Randi Joseph.</p>
