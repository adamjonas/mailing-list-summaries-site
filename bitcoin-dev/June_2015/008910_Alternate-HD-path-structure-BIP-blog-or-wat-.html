    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gem, a company that offers wallets for multiple cryptocurrencies is considering a new HD wallet path structure to validate the address format, select appropriate daemon for scanning tokenized assets and choose multiple blockchain data sources. They are proposing to separate the coin_type field into two fields- network and asset_type. The purpose of this is to allow the HDNode's path to contain all the necessary information without having to maintain an explicit mapping of coin_type -> network or asset_type_to_blockchain mapping. The proposed path structure is: m / purpose' / network' / asset_type' / account' / change / index. The company is not sure about the relevance of the exact path structure as all those variables need to be stored internally within the wallet database. There is no way to retrieve the path from just the address and the values will be stored within the wallet when the address is looked up. Gem is considering publishing the information in a blog post or on Github for developers who want to implement import_from_gem_structure. They are also seeking feedback on whether a similar proposal has been made before.</p>
