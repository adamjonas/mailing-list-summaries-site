    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion focuses on the power dynamics within the Bitcoin community, particularly between Bitcoin developers, miners, users, merchants, and exchanges. Milly Bitcoin asserts that the Core Maintainer has always been in control of the consensus rules, and any changes to the code must go through them. However, Patrick Murck points out that the role of the Core Maintainer is primarily about project management and open-source software development, not the bitcoin network itself.The conversation then delves into the issue of veto power held by a few developers who can block code changes despite having minimal stake in Bitcoin holdings. The accused developer argues that their contributions to the software are independent of their Bitcoin holdings and that alternatives to using their software exist. They believe that seeking consensus among the community is the current process for making decisions, and any other formal process could lead to centralization and corruption, damaging Bitcoin.Milly highlights the tremendous influence that developers have over the official release, and there are currently no mechanisms for safely deploying controversial changes to the consensus rules. They suggest that the Bitcoin software development system is vulnerable to attacks from individuals with veto power. The discussion also touches on the issue of semantics related to the term "decider," which is relevant only when changing the consensus rules.Finally, the conversation ends with links to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in decision-making processes concerning Bitcoin's future. Despite the challenges and power dynamics within the community, the participants acknowledge the need to work together to maintain the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network.</p>
