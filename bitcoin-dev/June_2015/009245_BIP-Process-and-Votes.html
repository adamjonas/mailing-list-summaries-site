    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andrew Lapp has suggested to create a document outlining all the possible failure modes due to the current system, its security assumptions and possible solutions. This would be a better way to solve the semantic debate rather than continuing with the current discussion that is not yielding any results. Milly Bitcoin criticized the idea of creating an FAQ as it will be developed by the same small group controlling Github and they might spin it in an unrealistic way. She also expressed her concern over Bitcoin Wiki having incorrect and cult-like claims about how Bitcoin works. She suggested reevaluating the info on the Wiki piece-by-piece and moving it to Bitcoin.org. However, the developers didn't like that idea, and attempts to edit the Wiki often lead to the articles being defaced by the maintainers. Adam Back proposed to have a second mailing list, bitcoin-process, for people to learn about the Bitcoin process. He also suggested writing a FAQ on its sign-up page so that people interested could discuss from a starting point of understanding how and why it works the way it does. The discussion has been taking up a lot of room in Andrew's inbox, and he thinks that creating a document outlining all the possible failure modes due to the current system, its security assumptions and possible solutions would be a better solution to solve the semantic debate.</p>
