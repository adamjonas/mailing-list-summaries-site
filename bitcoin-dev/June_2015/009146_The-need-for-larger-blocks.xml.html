    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a contradiction between the economic policy's status quo of avoiding fee pressure and the consensus status quo of not having a hard fork in terms of increasing block size. This issue has been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, where some argue that doing nothing and fixing the mempool to scale with the number of unconfirmed transactions is a valid option that requires more work than increasing the block size. They believe that increasing the block size should be considered an option rather than a need, and changing the consensus rules to force everyone to adapt their software is not maintaining the status quo. The concern is that increasing the block size may increase the risk of centralization, but keeping the current status quo of blocks not being filled could eventually lead to rising fees and prioritizing transactions with bigger fees.</p>
