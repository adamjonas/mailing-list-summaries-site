    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange in 2015, Eric Lombrozo expressed concern that many in the Bitcoin space had not adequately assessed the risks associated with potential double-spend attacks. While Lombrozo acknowledged that unconfirmed transactions were not part of any global consensus, he emphasized the danger of accepting them as final without fully considering the risks and making contingency plans for inevitable attacks. Jorge Tim√≥n disagreed with Lombrozo's premise, citing Satoshi's statement that as long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. However, Lombrozo clarified that he was not suggesting unconfirmed transactions were part of any global consensus, but rather warning against blindly accepting them without assessing the risks.</p>
