        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the Bitcoin development community, there are numerous proposals addressing the minimum block size questions and scalability issues. Bryan Bishop has compiled a list of these proposals, which includes ideas from various individuals. Some of the proposals mentioned include a dynamic block size limit controller by maaku, increasing the maximum block size using a soft-fork by Tier Nolan, an elastic block cap with rollover penalties by Meni Rosenfield, variable mining effort by gmaxwell, and a BIP100 soft-fork limit of 2 MB by jgarzik.Other proposals mentioned in the list include transaction fee targeting, difficulty target scaling, an annual 50% increase in the maximum block size, and various algorithmic adjustment proposals. Adam Back has proposed extension blocks, and there are suggestions for voting by paying to an address or fees. Sergio Lerner proposes reducing the block rate instead of increasing the maximum block size, while other proposals suggest decreasing the block interval and increasing the default soft block size limit in Bitcoin Core.There are also proposals to consider the size of the utxo set when determining the maximum block size, as well as reducing and decreasing the max block size. Some developers suggest changing the value of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE in Bitcoin Core, while others have highlighted problems with floating block size limits. Additionally, developers have proposed alternative solutions such as simplified payment verification, the lightning network, GHOST, payment channels, and tree chains to support high transaction volumes.However, it is important to note that some proposals have limitations, including vote censorship and utxo depth, which cannot achieve consensus. Furthermore, the list compiled by Bryan Bishop is missing old Bitcoin-development and Bitcointalk proposals. To ensure thorough discussion and fact-checking, there is a miningconsensus.slack.com group available for further engagement on these topics.</p>
