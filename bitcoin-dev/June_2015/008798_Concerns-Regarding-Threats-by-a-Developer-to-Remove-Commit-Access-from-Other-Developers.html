    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange in 2015, Mike Hearn questioned how decisions were made in Bitcoin Core. Mark Friedenbach responded saying that while it may be difficult to write down a system of rules, the technical community has a reasonable understanding of what "technical consensus" is and know it when they see it. However, Russ disagreed and said that there needs to be a more formalized process as the current process is haphazard, unclear, and constantly changing without being written down. He argues that a more formalized process would channel activity into a more usable format, and that this kind of situation often arises as projects become larger and more diverse.</p>
