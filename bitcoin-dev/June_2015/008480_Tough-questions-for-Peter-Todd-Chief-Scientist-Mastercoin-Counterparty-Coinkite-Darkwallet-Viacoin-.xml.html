    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Sven Berg and Kr, specific questions were asked regarding the accountability of Peter. Berg asks for information such as hours worked per project out of a 40-hour work week, upfront and ongoing fees for the use of Peter's name, total amounts broken down for each project, start and end dates of contracts, current and past holdings of altcoins/appcoins, return on investment to investors related to Peter's activities during employment (other than marketing/price pump), involvement with Initial Coin Offers (ICO), and rational for pursuit of ICO fund sources rather than community/established businesses. These questions were asked in relation to Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
