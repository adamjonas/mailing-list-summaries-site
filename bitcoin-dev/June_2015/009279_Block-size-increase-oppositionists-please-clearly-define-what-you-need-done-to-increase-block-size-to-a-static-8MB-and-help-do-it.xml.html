    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this email thread revolves around the topic of scaling the Bitcoin network. The idea of doubling the capacity is proposed to increase the number of network participants. However, there is no clear way to scale beyond that and it is argued that simply increasing capacity along with hardware could be a solution. The issue of an 8MB block size increase is also mentioned, with concerns raised about how it could exclude many mainnet participants and degrade decentralization. To address this, testing at double capacity (2MB) is suggested as a potential solution. Nonetheless, the question of why bother doubling capacity if there is no clear way to scale beyond that remains.</p>
