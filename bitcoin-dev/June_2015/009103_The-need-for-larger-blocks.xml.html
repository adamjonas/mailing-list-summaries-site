    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, suggested in an email thread on June 26th, 2015 that it would be unreasonable to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain beyond what competing systems already offer. The idea of "reasonably achievable" was discussed as a guideline to avoid potential problems caused by declaring too little or too much capacity. This guideline aligns with the thinking of Gavin Andresen, another prominent Bitcoin developer, although there may be differences in opinion regarding the specific numbers involved. It was also mentioned that making a huge increase in capacity all at once would be silly unless it is deemed reasonable and achievable. The free market could then handle any further changes.</p>
