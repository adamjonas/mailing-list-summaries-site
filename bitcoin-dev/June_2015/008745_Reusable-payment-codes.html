    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 24, 2015, Justus Ranvier wrote an RFC on a new type of Bitcoin address called a payment code which he shared via Github. Payment codes are SPV-friendly alternatives to DarkWallet-style stealth addresses that positively identify senders to recipients and automatically provide for transaction refunds. They require less blockchain data storage than stealth addresses; payment codes require 65 bytes of OP_RETURN data per sender-recipient pair while stealth addresses require 40 bytes per transaction. Payment codes can be publicly advertised and associated with a real-life identity without causing a loss of financial privacy. In the email thread, Peter Todd was contacted regarding BIP 63 but had not responded. Several people offered to send donations to see the BIP (63) advance, but no donation address was posted. The author supports seeing reusable payment codes move to draft on <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips</a>. Lastly, there is a link in the email to a dashboard for servers and applications across Physical-Virtual-Cloud that offers monitoring support with 50+ applications.</p>
