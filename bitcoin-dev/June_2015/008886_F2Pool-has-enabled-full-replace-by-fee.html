    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Adrian Macneil, Wladimir van der Laan, and Gregory Maxwell called Chainalysis's actions a Sybil attack. The Bitcoin P2P network is resilient when the chance of any one node going down is uncorrelated with others. If a bug exists in a node that fails to relay transactions/blocks properly, it will disrupt a large portion of the network all at once. Coinbase runs about a dozen nodes running regular Bitcoin Core in various subnets. They are contractually obliged to accept zeroconf payments with some customers. Coinbase aims to drive bitcoin adoption by making it easy for people to spend their bitcoin with merchants online but doesn't have a concrete plan beyond the possibility of getting contracts with hashing power, maybe even just a majority of hashing power.</p>
