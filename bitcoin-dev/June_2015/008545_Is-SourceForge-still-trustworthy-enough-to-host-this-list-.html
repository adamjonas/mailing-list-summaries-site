    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion about changing the e-mail list provider took place, and it was suggested that finding a free solution may be challenging. The idea of making a pay-per-message or byte solution was also put forward, with the sender being responsible for payment. This could motivate people to be more concise and limit spam. Andy Schroder asked for thoughts on the matter.In an email response, Wladimir J. van der Laan mentioned that all downloads (even old ones) have recently been deleted from SourceForge. He had no opinion on the mailing list issue, though he acknowledged that moving the mailing list has been discussed before, but people can't agree on where to move to.</p>
