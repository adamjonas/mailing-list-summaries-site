    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of separating the hard/soft fork upgrades in order to establish a process for the community to self-determine the way forward in a transparent and verifiable manner was proposed by Pindar. Matt expressed concern that giving miners this much power would make other members of the bitcoin ecosystem hesitant about the idea as it essentially lets them vote to change the rules of the system. Instead, the proposal suggests that we vote with the software we run, and all upgrade. Stephen believes that while the idea has merits, it is unlikely to get enough support to be merged into bitcoin core.</p>
