    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about who can make changes to Bitcoin Core, and how consensus changes are made. For code changes that do not change consensus, Wladimir is the decider but he takes others' technical opinions under reasonable consideration and prefers clear agreement among them. For changes to the consensus rules, it is not anyone's decision for anyone else. The criteria for a clear super-majority of people and businesses who use Bitcoin the most need to be met before changes are recommended. There cannot be a voting process for consensus changes, as this would centralize the system, and if everyone could vote, it would allow the sibyls to outvote everyone.</p>
