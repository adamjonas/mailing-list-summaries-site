    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Jorge Timón suggests a softfork solution to the timewarp exploit in Bitcoin. He proposes that all blocks should be within one day of the median of the previous 11 blocks, adding a condition at the other end instead of being greater than that value. However, he acknowledges that it wouldn't be a total fix but would protect against the exploit. A stricter soft fork would require the two blocks in question to have the same timestamp, forcing the off by 1 and the correct value to give the same result. Timón believes that a hard fork is necessary to fix the issue "right," especially if it is only to show a non-controversial hard fork.</p>
