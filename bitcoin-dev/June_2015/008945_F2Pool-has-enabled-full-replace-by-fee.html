    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion centers around non-repudiation in Bitcoin transactions. Eric Lombrozo suggests that if a non-repudiation mechanism is desired, it should be explicitly defined in the protocol. However, Justusranvier argues that non-repudiation is intrinsic to the ECDSA signatures used in Bitcoin, and that there is no way to accidentally sign or announce a transaction. The lack of identity in the Bitcoin protocol makes it difficult to establish the sender's intent and legal entity. Despite some legitimate use cases for conflicting transactions, parties involved in commercial transactions must know some minimal amount of identity information. If a payee receives a double spend payment, they are justified in treating it as fraud and using non-Bitcoin recourse mechanisms if necessary. From the network's perspective, the correct action for any node or miner is to relay the first version of any transaction they see. However, nodes or miners wishing to deviate from this behavior should take care not to introduce harmful unintended side effects like making fraud easier.</p>
