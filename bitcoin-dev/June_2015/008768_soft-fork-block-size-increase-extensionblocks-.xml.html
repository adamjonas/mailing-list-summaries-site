    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the issue of increasing the block size limit for Bitcoin transactions. Raystonn argues for an increase in the default block limit to the full 1MB in the next release, as they are already hitting that limit in bursts of transactions. They believe that hitting 1 million transactions per day will be impossible without raising the maximum block size. Mike Hearn raises concerns about reduced security if software is incompatible with the increased block size, whereas by simply increasing the block size, SPV wallets don't care and fully validating wallets can be updated with a small code change. The discussion also includes clarification from Hearn on his stance regarding scalability, stating that he never argued for VISA scale and that it would be decades away even if it does happen. The email exchange is part of the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
