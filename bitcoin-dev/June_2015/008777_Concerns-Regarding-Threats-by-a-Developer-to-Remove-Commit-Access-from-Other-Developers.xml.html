    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn, a software developer at plan99.net, believes that managing Bitcoin with a Linux kernel style dictator would be counterproductive. He claims that this approach would lead to centralization, which is not ideal for Bitcoin. While people can fork the Linux kernel without affecting others, in Bitcoin, a hard fork puts everyone's bitcoins at risk. Additionally, he argues that such an approach would put Gavin in danger from violent threats and blackmailing, as well as regulatory issues.Hearn hopes that all of the current confrontation surrounding Bitcoin will ultimately prove useful by demonstrating that the cryptocurrency cannot be changed centrally. He believes that any changes to Bitcoin must be made with consensus to maintain its decentralized nature.</p>
