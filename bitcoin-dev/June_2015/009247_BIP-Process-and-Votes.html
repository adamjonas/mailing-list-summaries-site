    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member suggested the creation of a living document of risks and mitigations as well as a decentralization metric. The idea was to measure proposed changes against these risks and metrics in a standard fashion. However, the individual was not allowed to post to Github and any Bip proposal was supposed to be vetted on the mailing list first. In response, another member suggested creating a document outlining all the failure modes possible due to the current system, its security assumptions, and possible solutions. They also recommended writing a BIP and having it reviewed and critiqued. There was also a suggestion for a second mailing list, "bitcoin-process", where people could learn about Bitcoin process, and a FAQ on its sign-up page to provide a starting point for understanding how and why it works.</p>
