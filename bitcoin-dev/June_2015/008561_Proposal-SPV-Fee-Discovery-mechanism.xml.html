    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Nathan Wilcox proposed a solution to the problem associated with wallets not having good ways of learning fee information. He suggested putting fee statistics into locally-verifiable data available to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients. He mentioned that it could be done by agreeing on a data format and encoding it in an op_return output in the coinbase transaction. However, SPV protocols would need to include this coinbase txn if it is going to help SPV clients. In practice, services like blockcypher are used to improve reliability of zero-conf to tell about the fee-per-kb needed. Nathan also discussed the possibility of upgrading the protocol without a hard-fork. Aaron Voisine added to the discussion by suggesting using APIs for timely stats, and putting a hard-coded range around it to protect against the service being compromised.</p>
