    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, an expert in the field of cryptocurrency, has reviewed a draft proposal for soft-fork introduction of a new Proof of Work (POW) on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. In response to the proposal, Todd argues that it can't be called a soft fork, but rather a "pseudo-soft-fork" due to its different security model. The proposal suggests introducing auxiliary POW blocks between normal blocks, with each aux-POW block pointing to the previous normal block and containing transactions like a normal block. Each normal block, in turn, would point to the previous aux-POW block and must contain all transactions from that block. Todd notes that the cost of attack varies smoothly as the POW weights vary. To attack non-upgraded nodes, one would still have to "51%" the original POW, and the reward going to that POW will vary smoothly between 1.0 * block reward and whatever target value is set (e.g. 0.5 * block reward). Todd envisions the transition of POW weights taking place over a period of 1-3 years, which leaves plenty of time to upgrade after the fork activates.While the proposal is not without its challenges, Todd's review provides valuable insights into its potential benefits and drawbacks.</p>
