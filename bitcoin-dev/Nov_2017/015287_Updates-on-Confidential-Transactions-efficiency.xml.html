    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Gregory Maxwell discussed the scalability and privacy of different transaction topologies. He noted that ring-in and tree-in approaches, used by Monero and Zcash, are more private but less scalable than CT+valueshuffle. However, he also mentioned a fourth topology that is closely related to ring-in, which involves taking N inputs and writing >= N outputs, replacing some coins with new outputs or encrypted dummies while re-encrypting others in a way that their owner can still decode. This approach avoids the spent coins list by allowing for malleation of inputs. In the past, there was no efficient way to construct this topology in a plain DL setting, but it may be possible with bulletproofs.</p>
