    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is incentive for miners to select segwit transactions over non-segwit ones due to artificially distorted block weight rules. By choosing segwit transactions, miners can fit more transactions into a block and earn more fees. However, there have been concerns about changing the definition of TxID, as it would require a hardfork upgrade and potentially lead to a chain split if not everyone upgrades. One potential solution is to use "normalised TxID" (BIP140) as a softfork to fix malleability issues without changing the definition of TxID. This solution does not have the side-effect of block size increase or provide an incentive to control the size of UTXO set, but it does make the UTXO set permanently bigger as the database needs to store both txid and normalised txid. There have also been questions about why the format of the transaction needs to be changed in segwit, and whether the Transaction ID can be computed in the same way as the hash for signing the transaction.</p>
