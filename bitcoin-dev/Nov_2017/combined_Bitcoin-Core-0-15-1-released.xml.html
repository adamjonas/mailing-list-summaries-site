        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released version 0.15.1 with bugfixes, performance improvements and updated translations. Users running an older version must shut it down before upgrading to the new release. When running version 0.15.0 or higher, the chainstate database will be converted to a new format which could take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour. Compatibility notes state that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. The release includes network fork safety enhancements, miner block size limiting deprecated, GUI settings backed up on reset, duplicate wallets disallowed, low-level RPC changes, validation updates, build system amendments, wallet fixes, tests and QA. Bitcoin Core is tested on multiple operating systems including Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+ and Windows Vista and later but does not support Windows XP. The new version 0.15.1 of Bitcoin Core has several bug fixes and minor updates. Contributors have fixed the issue of rpc mapping check, added the wait_until_stopped helper method, moved wait_until to util, and added connectivity check before sending in assumevalid.py. The initial RPC timeout has also been increased to 60 seconds. In addition, there are some miscellaneous updates such as disallowing uncompressed pubkeys in bitcoin-tx output adds, updating Windows build instructions for using WSL and Ubuntu 17.04, and allowing revoked keys to expire in verify-commits. The release credits include a long list of contributors who directly contributed to this release, along with translators on Transifex. It is important to note that the file format of fee estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0, so a downgrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee estimates to be discarded.</p>
