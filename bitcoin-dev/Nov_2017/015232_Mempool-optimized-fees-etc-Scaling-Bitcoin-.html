    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The paper linked in this context is a detailed account of the research conducted on optimizing fee estimation through mempool state. The author has also given a presentation on this topic at Scaling Stanford, but the paper covers more than what was discussed in the presentation.The research aims to improve fee estimation by analyzing the current state of the mempool, which is a collection of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be added to a block. By studying the mempool, the researchers were able to identify patterns and trends that can help determine the most optimal fees for transactions.The paper goes into detail about the methodology used to collect and analyze data from the mempool. It also includes charts and graphs to illustrate the findings from the research. The author invites feedback on their work to further improve their findings.Overall, the paper provides a thorough examination of the potential benefits of using mempool state to optimize fee estimation. The research could have significant implications for the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of transactions on blockchain networks.</p>
