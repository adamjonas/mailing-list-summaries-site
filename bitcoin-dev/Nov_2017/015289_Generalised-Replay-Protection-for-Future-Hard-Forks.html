    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of putting the hash of a block that must be on the chain, which makes transactions safer overall and allows light clients to differentiate between multiple forks. Transactions can be replay protected by setting a bit in the `SigHashId` which specifies whether `nForkId` is appended or not. Every leaf must be assigned a unique `nForkId`, and transactions are only valid if the `nForkId` matches the `nForkId` of the validating software. The relationship between `nForkId` is irrelevant as long as they are unique. It is suggested that the goal should not be to make this overly complicated since it's fundamentally impossible to disallow transactions in future projects. In the past three months, at least $600k has been lost by users sending BCH to a BTC address.</p>
