        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>MoonShadow, a non-programmer, has proposed the Confederation-Peg model for sidechains, which he believes does not require new modifications to the Bitcoin protocol. This model suggests that a confederation of large corporations could process a large number of Bitcoin transactions for net zero or near zero transaction fees. To add BTC to this sidechain, a main chain Bitcoiner would have to send funds to one of the sponsors after acquiring their agreement to issue sidechain coins using a special sidechain coinbase transaction. Although the model requires more trust than the trustless model of the main blockchain, it allows the sidechain to structure itself in any way necessary to enable safe referencing of unconfirmed transactions, thereby enabling nearly instant follow-up transactions. Paid-for transaction fees could be based upon whatever the sponsors agree to, including a transaction fee based on a percentage of the transfer value instead of the byte-size of a transaction. MoonShadow believes that "clients" choose whether the lower transaction costs and convenience at these institutions are worth the re-addition of trust to some portion of their Bitcoin activities. This low-trust model depends on the idea that the sponsors do not entirely trust each other and will keep an eye on each other for bad behavior. Sidechains would fix the issue of Bitcoin's lack of anonymity even without improved anonymity rules, as the entire transaction history is visible.</p>
