    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Cash is set to hard fork on November 13th in order to incorporate a new difficulty algorithm. The algorithm employs a nice median of 3 for the beginning and end of the window, and uses a simple approach that follows the "simplest is best" route. They have also written the code and are about to use it live. Bitcoin may also need to hard fork to implement a similar algorithm. The algorithm has a few limits on the adjustment per block which is more than they will ever need. The author recommends that bitcoin consider using this algorithm and making it N=50 instead of 144. Any attempt to modify the algorithm with things like a low pass filter would only reduce its effectiveness. Another contender to the algorithm is new and better, devised by Degnr8 and called D622 or wt-144. It gives a linearly higher weight to the more recent timestamps. The author believes that any modification to the strict mathematical weighted average of the algorithm will reduce its effectiveness, as it does not oscillate anymore than regular algos and rises faster and drops faster when needed.</p>
