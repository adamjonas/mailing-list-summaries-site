    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the post suggests a better way to leave comments on relatively small BIPs that are not worth bothering the list. Each BIP has a wiki page for discussion, which is linked from the Comments-URI field in the BIP. However, the process seems to be clunky and needs improvement. The author suggests using Github issues for each BIP. One concern could be that the ease of use of Github issues might move discussion away from the list. To prevent this, the issue could be temporarily locked. Another concern could be confusing between PRs and the discussion issue. The author asks if proposing a change to the process or creating a new BIP would be the next step if people agree with the idea.</p>
