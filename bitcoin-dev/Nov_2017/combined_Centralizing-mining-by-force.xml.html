        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The potential threat of a "51% attack" on Bitcoin has recently been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. This type of attack would involve a miner or group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network's hash power, giving them the ability to manipulate transactions and potentially double-spend coins. While there is no technical mechanism in place to prevent such an attack, it is argued that miners are unlikely to perform it due to the impact it would have on confidence in Bitcoin and their own revenues.However, there is still a concern about maintaining permissionless mining. A cartel forming among miners and orphaning blocks made by outsiders could present a problem. Collusion among a group of miners could make this possible, which is why full nodes must be aware of the rules and reject any attempt to centralize mining by force.The security model of Bitcoin relies on miners and merchants defending their mutually-beneficial market from the state. Those threatened by Bitcoin's disruption of state privilege may try to disrupt the market for transaction confirmation since statism is profitable and a primary source of revenue is seigniorage. Despite broad decentralization mitigating the risk to each individual, people must be willing to defend their mines and economic nodes, which requires personal risk.Even in a highly-decentralized system, overpowering taxpayer-funded disruption of the confirmation market will require merchants to pay aggregate fees exceeding the mining subsidy expended by the taxpayer to disrupt it. The outcome of this tug of war between taxpayers and Bitcoin defenders is unclear, but proponents of Bitcoin believe it is possible for individuals to prevail.It is much less likely for one actor to gain a majority of hash power alone, but with collusion, it could happen. However, miners have a strong financial incentive to act in the best interest of the network, making it less likely for them to engage in such behavior.</p>
