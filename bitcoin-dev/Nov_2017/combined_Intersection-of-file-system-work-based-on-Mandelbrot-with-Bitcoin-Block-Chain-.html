        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context has been working on a filesystem based on Mandelbrot's formula and believes that it could be used to extend the Bitcoin algorithm. They are looking to discuss this concept with others. The potential benefit of using Mandelbrot workers is that they could assist in modifying the verification work so that it could reign in the next iteration of hash results. Additionally, the hash results could help create a fast lookup table for future variations of the blockchain.By utilizing Mandelbrot's formula, the author is proposing a new approach to the Bitcoin algorithm that could offer significant advantages. The author notes that the use of Mandelbrot workers could help modify verification work, which would improve the accuracy of hash results. This could result in faster and more efficient processing of the blockchain.Furthermore, the hash results generated by Mandelbrot workers could be used to create a fast lookup table for future variations of the blockchain. This would allow for quick and easy access to relevant information, further streamlining the blockchain process.Overall, the author's proposition of using Mandelbrot's formula in the Bitcoin algorithm offers exciting possibilities. By collaborating with others, the author hopes to develop this idea further and potentially revolutionize the blockchain industry.</p>
