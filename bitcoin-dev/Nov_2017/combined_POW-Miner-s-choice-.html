        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the post proposes implementing two available POW mining algorithms, such as "Double-SHA256" and "Cuckoo Cycle", and letting the miner choose which one to use for POW. The two algorithms would have independent difficulties, and after each difficulty period, the difficulty would be adjusted to aim for a 50/50 distribution of the two algorithms in addition to aiming for a 10-minute block time. The adjustment could be done by either adjusting up difficulty for the algorithm used in most blocks last period or adjusting down difficulty for the algorithm with the least number of blocks last period, depending on whether the combined difficulty was to be adjusted up or down. Another option suggested is adjusting both difficulties based on the relative difference of the number of blocks where they are used.This proposal aims to increase mining distribution and continue mining even when one type of miners suddenly jump to mine a more profitable altcoin. The author acknowledges that they are not sure if this idea has been proposed and rejected before but cannot remember seeing it discussed. Finally, the author notes that this proposal would likely require a hard fork.</p>
