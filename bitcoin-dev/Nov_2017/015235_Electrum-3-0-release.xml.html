    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Electrum 3.0 has been recently released and it is no longer supported on Python2, but on Python3 and Qt5. The new update includes Native segwit scripts which are supported using a new type of seed. The version number for segwit seeds is 0x100. To create a segwit-in-p2sh wallet, hardware wallets or bip39 seeds will be required to enter a BIP49 derivation path. The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized using new version numbers. Also, the Wallet Import Format (WIF) is similarly extended for segwit scripts. A new version of the Electrum protocol is required by the client (version 1.1). Transactions are time-locked to the height of the current block by default, but other values of locktime may be passed using the command line. The release notes have also advised users to keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be able to receive bitcoins during the transition period as BIP173 is still in draft status and other wallets/websites may not support it. If BIP173 ends up being rejected or substantially modified, your wallet may have to be restored from seed.</p>
