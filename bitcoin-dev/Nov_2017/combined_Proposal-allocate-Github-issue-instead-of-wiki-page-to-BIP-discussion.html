        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sjors Provoost put forward a suggestion to enable Github issues for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Currently, discussions on BIPs take place on wiki pages, but leaving comments requires editing the page. Provoost argues that using Github issues would streamline the commenting process and make it more efficient. However, there are concerns about diverting discussion away from the mailing list and potential confusion between pull requests and discussion issues.The author of the post acknowledges that the current method of leaving comments on BIPs, through wiki pages, can be cumbersome and in need of improvement. To address this, they propose utilizing Github issues for each BIP. By linking each BIP's wiki page to a corresponding issue on Github, it would provide an easier way for individuals to leave comments, especially for smaller BIPs that may not warrant extensive discussion on the mailing list. However, one concern raised is that the introduction of Github issues might lead to a shift in discussion away from the mailing list. To mitigate this, the author suggests temporarily locking the issue to prevent further comments and ensuring that the main discussion still takes place on the mailing list. Another potential issue is the confusion that could arise between pull requests and the discussion issues on Github.To address these concerns, the author seeks clarification on the next steps if the community agrees with the idea. They inquire whether proposing a change to the existing commenting process or creating a new BIP altogether would be the appropriate course of action.In summary, Sjors Provoost proposes enabling Github issues for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to improve the commenting process. While acknowledging the current clunkiness of using wiki pages for discussion, there are concerns about diverting discussion away from the mailing list and confusion between pull requests and discussion issues on Github. The author seeks guidance on the next steps if the community supports the idea, whether it involves proposing a change or creating a new BIP.</p>
