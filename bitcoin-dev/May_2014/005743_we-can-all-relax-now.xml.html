    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author created a simulation framework called simbit to simulate the selfish mining attack, which is general enough to simulate any p2p network. It's written in javascript and can be demoed in the web browser or run on Node. The framework is still in early alpha and feedback is appreciated. In response to the Selfish Mining paper, kjj criticized the lack of a decent network simulator and offered 1 BTC as a bounty for building a general bitcoin network simulator framework. The simulator should be able to account for latency between nodes and ideally within a node, simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network and make decisions based only on what the attacker actually knows. It needs to be able to simulate this "attack" and should be generic enough to be easily modified for other crazy schemes.The lack of a decent network simulator allowed the Selfish Mining paper to get press. If the author had been able to see the importance of the stuff he was ignoring, we wouldn't be wasting so much time correcting him (and sadly the reporters that have no way to check his claims).</p>
