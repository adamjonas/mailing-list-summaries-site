    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin Core developer, announced on May 7th, 2014 that he had created a Bitcoin Core fork that provides statistics to StatsD, in an effort to gain more insight into what messages and requests a node is processing. The announcement was made in an email which contained links to the blog post where he introduces his latest creation named 'Statoshi,' as well as his Github page where the code can be found. Wladimir, another Bitcoin Core developer, complimented Lopp's work and suggested that it could be incorporated into Bitcoin Core node-only installers in the future to offer users the ability to keep track of their nodes.</p>
