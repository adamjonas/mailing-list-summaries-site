    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a blog post titled "Decor," author Sergio Lerner discusses a method of decorating Bitcoin transaction messages in order to add personalization and privacy. Lerner states that currently, Bitcoin transaction messages are limited to a certain length and contain standardized information such as the recipient's address and the amount being sent. However, by using a specific format for the messages, users can add additional information such as personal messages or descriptions of the transaction purpose.Lerner proposes a format for these decorated transaction messages, which includes a unique identifier followed by the desired message and a checksum for verification purposes. He also notes that this method can increase privacy by making it more difficult for third parties to link transactions together.The blog post includes examples of how this method could be used, including adding a personalized message to a donation transaction or indicating the reason for a payment. Lerner also suggests that businesses could use this method to include additional information about their products or services in transaction messages.Overall, Lerner argues that this method of decorating Bitcoin transaction messages adds a level of personalization and privacy to the Bitcoin network, and encourages others to adopt this method.</p>
