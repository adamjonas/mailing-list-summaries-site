    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Alex Kotenko is discussing the issues he faced while demonstrating his XBTerminal POS on the Bitcoin Conference. He mentions that Andreas' testnet Bitcoin Wallet wasn't working because of a failure in the peer discovery, which caused problems for the demonstration. To resolve this issue, Alex has set up and will run a well-connected testnet node himself, which will be used for the XBTerminal. However, he also mentions that the DNS discovery problem is really an issue, even for testnet. Jeff Garzik responds to Alex's email and mentions that there are only two testnet seeds listed in bitcoind, and one of them returns SERVFAIL (testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org) and the other just returns one A record (testnet-seed.bluematt.me). He suggests that if someone is going to depend on testnet, especially for an important demo, they should contribute to the infrastructure as this stuff doesn't just fix itself for free. Laszlo Hanyecz chimes in and says that it looks like it might be firewalled, probably just need to fix the ACL in EC2. Andreas Schildbach mentions that the current Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure is unstable. He assumes that this is because they're using a custom DNS implementation, which is not 100% compatible. There have been bugs in the past, like a case-sensitive match for the domain name. Current state of the testnet seeds taken from bitcoinj is mentioned. Overall, the email thread discusses the issues related to the testnet seeds and the DNS discovery problem. Jeff Garzik suggests contributing to the infrastructure, and Alex Kotenko sets up his own full node for the XBTerminal demonstration.</p>
