    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, Andreas Schildbach is responding to an issue with the bitcoin seeder software. He mentions that the software has been around for about 30 years and the protocol hasn't changed much since then. The last time there was an issue, it was due to a non RFC-conformance bug on the bitcoin seeders side. Andreas asks if the seeder can add simple logging to help debug the issue. In response, someone apologizes for not having time to fix the issue due to traveling for their consulting job and suggests that someone else volunteer to step up. The message ends with a PGP signature.</p>
