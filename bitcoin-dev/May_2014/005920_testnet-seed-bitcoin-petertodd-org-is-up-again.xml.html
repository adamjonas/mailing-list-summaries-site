    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Rob is discussing a problem with his suggestion to use bind forwarding. He explains that Bind is stripping off the authoritative answer bit in the reply, causing the recursor to go into a loop chasing the authority server which again returns a non-authoritative answer with itself as the authority again. He thinks that if Bind was returning authoritative answers it would work, but he can't see any way to make that happen in the Bind configuration. On another thread, Alex Kotenko reports that he can reach his nameserver and get DNSseed response if he queries it directly with dig @node.alexykot.me testnet-seed.alexykot.me. However, when he tries nslookup testnet-seed.alexykot.me, it fails. He believes there is a problem in his DNS settings but he can't figure out what is it. So, he asks Peter Todd how he configured DNS for his seed to help him debug his own. Peter Todd responds that he has only received funds to cover expenses and a trivial amount on top to cover some time, and that given his busy schedule, he would like to give back the grant funds for doing so.</p>
