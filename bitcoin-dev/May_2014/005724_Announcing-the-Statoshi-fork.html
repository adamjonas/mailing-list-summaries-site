    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Charlie Shrem expressed excitement about installing a new software on his full node. He shared the link to his node page as well as requested others to encrypt messages with his PGP key. The conversation that followed between Mike Hearn and Wladimir discussed different ways to simplify the setup of components for Bitcoin Core stats aggregation and chart rendering. One possibility was to export stats over regular TCP and make them public, allowing anyone to listen to the stats feed for any node. Another approach was to have a site crawling nodes and aggregating chain heights by version to trigger an alert to people who are paying attention. While monitoring and analysis tends to appeal more to certain types of people than others, the idea was welcomed as worth some extra download size. Additionally, Python was considered necessary for the stats service since implementing things like web services in C++ is not realistic given the time constraints and great already-written code that is out there. The tool was suggested as external, not part of bitcoind itself.</p>
