    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about whether to run experimental p2p code inside production bitcoinds or to run an experimental gateway in another process on a node. It is considered better to run the experimental gateway during the development phase. However, if the code proves to be valuable, it will eventually need to be integrated or rewritten into Core to avoid increasing the setup cost of running a node and ending up with a two-tier network. The tradeoffs involved in this decision are complex and subtle. It is suggested that if the code will eventually be merged into Core, then it might as well be implemented directly into it, perhaps behind a switch that can disable those code paths if something goes wrong.</p>
