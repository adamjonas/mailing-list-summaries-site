    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin development mailing list about the use of 'bits' as a unit of measurement instead of 'millibits' or 'microbits' has brought up some interesting points. One argument in favor of using 'bits' is that it is easier to say and people may naturally tend to use it, similar to how 'bucks' is used for dollars. Additionally, 'bit' is already part of the word Bitcoin and symbolically represents the tech nature of the currency. The use of 'bit' as a unit of money is also a nod to its historical usage. However, some argue that adding another confusing term to the already complex world of Bitcoin may not be the best idea. The average person may not understand computer science or Bitcoin, and adding more confusing terminology may further complicate matters. Some examples of already confusing terms in Bitcoin include mining, addresses, and wallets. The goal should be to make Bitcoin understandable enough for people to use it without having to understand the intricacies of computer science. It is important to note that language plays a crucial role in achieving clear communication to the widest possible target audience, especially in marketing. Poor understanding can lead to confusion and should be avoided. However, the debate continues on whether 'bits' should become the new standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin.</p>
