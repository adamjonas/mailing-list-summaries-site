    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread from May 19, 2014, between Jeff Garzik and Raúl Martínez discusses the possibility of adding bitcoind and Bitcoin Core to Linux repositories. However, some conditions need to be met before this can happen, including having bitcoin developers dictate which dependent libraries are shipped with or built statically into the bitcoin binaries/libs, allowing fresh updates to older stable distros, and maintaining active maintainer(s) who follow bitcoin development and release status. Matt C's PPA is mentioned as a good example for meeting these conditions in Ubuntu. In an update to the email thread, it is noted that while conditions (1) and (3) are doable, Debian and Ubuntu policies make condition (2) difficult, aside from security patches. Micha Bailey and Scott have worked on removing bitcoin from Debian and Ubuntu stable releases due to this issue. Some alternative mechanisms, such as backports, volatile, and updates repositories, could meet condition (2), but user intervention is required, and they are not enabled by default. Debian unstable allows for condition (2), but the package is blocked from transitioning to a stable release. Matt C's PPA is still considered the best way to meet all three conditions on Ubuntu, and the Debian unstable package is the best option for Debian, though both require users to add a line to their apt sources list.</p>
