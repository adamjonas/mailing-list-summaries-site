    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 15, 2014, Andreas Schildbach raised the issue that the current Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure was unstable. He assumed that this was because a custom DNS implementation was not 100% compatible due to bugs in the past, such as a case-sensitive match for the domain name. The state of the seeds taken from bitcoinj was then listed. For mainnet, seed.bitcoin.sipa.be and dnsseed.bluematt.me were okay, while dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org had SERVFAIL and was tried multiple times by ISPs. The last seed, seed.bitcoinstats.com, was also okay. For testnet, testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org had SERVFAIL, but only from Telefonica, which is one of Europe's largest ISPs. Testnet-seed.bluematt.me was okay but only returned one node. Schildbach stated that he was not capable of writing C and suggested improving DNS himself by re-implementing everything in Java, which he doubted would be well received by others. Another important point to note is that British Telecom cannot communicate with Peter Todd's server which has implications on the larger European ISP network.</p>
