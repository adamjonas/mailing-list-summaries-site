    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is an extract of a post where the author presented the DECOR protocol. The author assumed that the amount of coins each miner earned in competing blocks was approximately the same, but this may not be true for Bitcoin since the reward is halved and we don't know what will happen with fees when this occurs. The author then explains how to use the DECOR+ protocol to prevent miners from abusing the system. If two miners compete for a certain block height with blocks A and B respectively, and Alice's block reward is half of Bob's reward, then even if Hash(A) < Hash(B), Alice can still win by following the DECOR+ protocol. BlockReward() returns the block subsidy plus the transaction fees in the block. The conditions on constants must be satisfied if different values of a,b,c,d,e are chosen that still force miners selections to converge into a single parent. It's interesting that it's now much easier to prove that for two competing miners, the DECOR+ protocol cannot be abused, since there is no dependence on the block content.</p>
