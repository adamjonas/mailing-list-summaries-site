    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alex Kotenko reached out to Peter Todd for help with DNS settings for his recently set up DNS seeds at testnet-seed.alexykot.me and bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me. While he could reach his nameserver and get a dnsseed response when querying directly with dig, nslookup for testnet-seed.alexykot.me failed. Alex suspected the problem was in his DNS settings but couldn't figure out what it was and sought Peter's help in debugging it. Earlier, Andreas Schildbach had informed that he had been traveling for a few weeks for his consulting job and did not have time to fix the issue. Peter mentioned he had only received funds to cover expenses and a trivial amount on top to cover some time and added that since his work would keep him frequently out of the country, he would like to give back the grant funds for running the seed infrastructure. He also wondered if Alex had verified if his copy of the seeder contained the commit 8dcc006e6256cb746c2b025daf3df41baa26353e, which fixed a bug with the symptoms they were seeing.</p>
