    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, the discussion revolves around the usage of the term "bits" as a unit of measurement for Bitcoin. Chris Pacia argues that "bits" is a better fit than other options because it is already part of the word "Bitcoin," symbolically represents the tech nature of Bitcoin, and was a unit of money in the past. Mike Caldwell adds that clear communication to the widest possible target audience using language most likely to be understood is crucial, highlighting that Bit (as a unit) is already confusing for those who do not deal with it regularly and stressing the importance of marketing. Christophe Biocca disagrees, stating that Bitcoin already has issues with terrible names for things like mining, addresses, and wallets, which he must explain to people new to Bitcoin, and adding another confusing term would be masochistic.</p>
