    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Alan Reiner, they discussed a modification in the way Bitcoin Core prioritizes blocks. Currently, it uses the first full block verified as the highest priority, but Reiner suggests that it should consider the first valid header received as the highest priority. However, Maxwell pointed out that this would open up an attack where someone could delay announcing the block content and continue to mine on the block without anyone else being able to do so.Maxwell suggested putting an expiration on the logic by ignoring the header-received time if the full new block hasn't been received within 5-10 seconds. They also mentioned Ashley, who is apparently working on solving this issue.</p>
