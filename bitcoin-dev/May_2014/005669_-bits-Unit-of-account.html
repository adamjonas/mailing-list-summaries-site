    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gordon Mohr suggested that "bits" is not a suitable name for a new unit of measurement in the Bitcoin system. Mohr argued that using the term "bits" to refer to units of money could cause confusion when people try to understand the technical details of the system, such as key sizes and storage/bandwidth needs. He also noted that "bit" has an established meaning as a binary digit and that Satoshi Nakamoto named the system after this concept. To avoid these problems, Mohr proposed creating a new word for the microbitcoin unit and suggested "zib" as a candidate. Aaron Voisine expressed support for using "bits" as a currency unit and suggested using the Unicode character U+0180, lowercase b with stroke, to represent the microBTC denomination.</p>
