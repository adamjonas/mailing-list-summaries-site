    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Justus Ranvier suggested to Gavin Andresen to create a Bitcoin social contract, outlining features that will never be added or taken away from Bitcoin. The contract would ensure that the protocol is not changed to allow for confiscation of funds even if demanded by someone. Recently RFC 7258 called Pervasive Monitoring is an Attack provides guidance on how to write such a social contract. The foundation bylaws state that the Corporation should promote and protect the decentralized, distributed and private nature of the Bitcoin system as well as individual choice, participation, and financial privacy when using such systems. Justus suggests adding fungibility and rejection of blacklists to that list since Adam Back's comments on how fungibility and privacy are inherently linked.</p>
