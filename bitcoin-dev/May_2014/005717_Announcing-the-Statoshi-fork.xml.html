    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jameson Lopp has created a Bitcoin Core fork which outputs statistics to StatsD in order to gain more insight into what messages and requests a node is processing. Lopp hopes that some people will find this interesting and potentially useful. Wladimir, responding to Lopp's announcement, said that they were coincidentally talking about showing stats from a node on a local website on the #bitcoin-dev IRC a few days ago. Wladimir thinks it would be nice to include something like this in the Bitcoin Core node-only installers so that users can keep an eye on their node(s).Lopp agrees that it would be awesome to offer these types of stats with the installer. However, he says that the route he's taken has dependencies on several other pieces of software to do all the heavy lifting of stats aggregation and chart rendering. He assumes that it would not be desirable to build any of that processing into Bitcoin Core itself. Therefore, he suggests packaging other software along with the installer. Lopp states that the next logical step may be for them to offer a public instance of these graphs and he'd be happy to work with them to set one up.</p>
