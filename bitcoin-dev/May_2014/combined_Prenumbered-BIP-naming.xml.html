        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Some people are struggling to attach labels to their yet-to-be-numbered BIPs. To solve this problem, it is recommended to call them "draft--" like draft-maxwell-coinburning in the style of pre-WG IETF drafts. In response to someone's question about why there is such a high bar to getting a number assigned to a BIP, it was explained that according to the process numbers shouldn't be assigned for things that haven't even been publicly discussed. The purpose of assigning numbers is so that organized discussions about all proposals can take place, even ones that aren't well-liked. Therefore, it can be useful to have something to call a proposal before other things happen.</p>
