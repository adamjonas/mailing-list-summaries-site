    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a conversation between two individuals regarding an issue with the testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org. The first person thanks the second person for looking into the issue but reports that it still fails for them. They provide information about the error they receive when trying to access the site and ask if the second person can look at the logfiles to see how the requests arrive. They also request to know what particular thing was fixed for future outages.The second person responds by providing some background information and referring to a github discussion that was had. They state that if all DNS seeds being down breaks your application, the application is insecure and should have fallbacks such as hardcoded node lists and manual peer entry. They suggest running your own centralized high-availability/low-latency nodes if instant startup is necessary. The conversation ends with an advertisement for automated cross-browser testing and a mailing list sign-up link.</p>
