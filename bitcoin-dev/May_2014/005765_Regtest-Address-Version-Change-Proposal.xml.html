    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Warren Togami Jr. proposed changing all of the address versions in -regtest mode to be unique so they are no longer identical to testnet. For example, regtest pubkey hash addresses could begin with r or R. Bitcoinj supports and uses regtest mode but would also have to be changed. The rationale for this proposal was not provided and a question was raised about the cost of having them be the same. The team needed to know if any existing tools would need to be modified to support this change to regtest. If the quantity of tools that currently handle regtest is small then they can modify them to the new address versions. The email also contained information about automated cross-browser testing and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
