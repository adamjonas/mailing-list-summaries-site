    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Jameson Lopp and Wladimir discuss the possibility of offering statistics with the Bitcoin Core installer. Jameson mentions that his approach has dependencies on several other pieces of software to do all the heavy lifting of stats aggregation and chart rendering. Wladimir says that if the extra download size for statistics is not too much, it would be worth including them as an optional tool external to bitcoind itself. They agree that implementing web services in C++ is not realistic given the time constraints and the great already-written code that is out there. Wladimir suggests using SNMP as an option so that clients do not need to be implemented and there are many tools written. The email ends with a message about a Perforce event focused on SCM systems.</p>
