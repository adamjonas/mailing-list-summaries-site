    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on 17th May 2014, Alex Kotenko inquired about the status of DNS seeds at testnet3 and found out that there were no working DNS seeds available. One of the two known DNS seeds was unreachable, and the other one was just providing one IP address, which was also not functional. Alex proposed to start a DNS seed of his own to fix this issue. He found the DNS seeder daemon suitable for his requirements. After setting up DNS seeds for mainnet and testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me along with well-connected nodes for both mainnet and testnet on the same server, Alex asked if this plan was good enough to help. The response was affirmative, and he was asked to share the details once he had something to test.</p>
