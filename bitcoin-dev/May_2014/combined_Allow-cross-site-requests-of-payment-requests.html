        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Andy has suggested an amendment to BIP 70 that would include an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" response header for payment request responses. This proposal would allow pure HTML5 web wallets to use the payment protocol entirely in-browser without needing the server hosting the wallet's HTML to fetch payment requests on the browser's behalf. Andy believes this approach is more elegant and has fewer security/resource implications for the back-end, and he does not anticipate any useful attack vectors being opened up by this amendment.The discussion is centered around the security concerns of mobile code fetching random web resources, which can result in unexpected security holes. The proposed amendment aims to prevent these security holes by allowing payment requests/payments to be accessed cross-site, as they already need to be publicly accessible endpoints from the server perspective. However, implementing the payment protocol with its own root cert store, ASN.1 parsing, RSA, etc., in browser-sandboxed JavaScript may not be popular, so it is unclear how useful this suggestion would be.Despite this, there is still value in fetching the payment request cross-site, even if the request payload is validated by a third party using a more conventional TLS/crypto suite. The author suggests exposing x.509/RSA/ASN.1/chain verification functionality, which browsers could easily offer. However, if there is no ability to implement this proposal, then it certainly won't be popular.</p>
