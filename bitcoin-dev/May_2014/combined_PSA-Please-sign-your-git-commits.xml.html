        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation, Kyle Jerviss explains that multisig is only useful for irreversible actions and not generally implemented in PGP. He acknowledges that PGP has its fair share of security flaws, but it was the first cryptographic tool used and distributed in a time when legality was a concern. There are more powerful cryptosystems available now, but the challenge is to make them usable to people. PGP is a general purpose tool and often used in irreversible contexts such as deploying software releases which could steal or destroy data. It is possible to have threshold PGP using RSA cryptosystem but no one has written the tools yet. In the future, upgrading bitcoin script 2.0 with a thoughtful design would allow it to be adopted as a signing cryptosystem in other applications. This would enable creating a public key that can only issue trust level 0 certifications, only certifications for certain organizations unless thresholded with an offline key, or only signing for messages meeting a certain programmatic predicate. In another email exchange, Mark Friedenbach asks what signed commits would do to help in their situation. Git places signatures in the history itself, so they cannot be used to indicate acceptance after code review. However, signed commits make it easier to sort out situations where git accounts or sites have been compromised and fraudulent commits have been submitted.</p>
