    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Matt Corallo and Laszlo Hanyecz on May 16, 2014, Matt Corallo mentioned that he had missed the fact that a testnet seed was not set up properly and was only pointing to a static seed node which was currently down. The mainnet seed was working fine. Laszlo reported that he received the same issue as well and provided details of his findings using host and dig commands. He found out that the testnet-seed.bluematt.me was an alias for bitcoin-seednode.bluematt.me which was an alias for desktopv2.bluematt.me having IP address 152.23.202.18. Further, he obtained the name servers for me domain and bluematt.me domain along with their corresponding IP addresses. Eventually, Andreas Schildbach had reported that the testnet-seed.bluematt.me was okay but it returned only one node.</p>
