    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on extending the protocol to support UDP transport has been raised to allow for NAT traversal and more people to run effective nodes. It's also been questioned whether it could improve block propagation time. However, a recent email suggests that miners in China are unlikely to mine on a China-specific chain as it will be outmined by non-Chinese miners and eventually orphaned. Instead, mining interests may make special arrangements to circumvent the Great Firewall of China. Users who can't access the worldwide blockchain will notice slow confirmation times and other side effects. A user also asked if a blockchain fork due to network split could happen, but this wasn't addressed in the response. The email was sent by Andy Alness, a software engineer at Coinbase in San Francisco.</p>
