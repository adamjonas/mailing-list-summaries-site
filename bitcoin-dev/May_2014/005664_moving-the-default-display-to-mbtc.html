    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on May 3rd, 2014, Ben Davenport made a suggestion to stop attaching SI prefixes to currency units. He argued that no other world currency uses SI prefixes and that people do not quote amounts as 63 k$ or 3 M$. He suggested using the standard format of $63k or $3M in the US. He further insisted on having one base unit that is not modified with SI prefixes and proposed that it should be 100 satoshi.However, Luke countered Ben's argument by stating that 'k' and 'M' are the SI prefixes and that people do use 63k USD, $63k, and $3M. He also pointed out that SI units have not been adopted naturally but by force of law. He concluded that the idea of naming another world currency that uses SI is impractical since most units of any measure are based on a number that factor to twos and threes (not fives, like decimal).</p>
