    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, clarified that the pushed-data size is limited to the standard format of OP_RETURN. He also pointed out that the code does not implement the "standard format" and any opcode after OP_RETURN is accepted, such as OP_RETURN OP_CHECKSIG. The email thread dated May 3, 2014, discussed the standard format of OP_RETURN. This thread was started by Peter Todd, who shared that the standard format ended up being exactly "OP_RETURN." Mark Friedenbach replied to this email, stating that the email was correct, but it was somewhat unintentional. Jeff Garzik's name and job title are mentioned in the email signature, along with his association with BitPay, Inc. Lastly, the email featured a sponsored message from SauceLabs, which promoted their Selenium testing platform available for free to accelerate Dev Cycles with Automated Cross-Browser Testing.</p>
