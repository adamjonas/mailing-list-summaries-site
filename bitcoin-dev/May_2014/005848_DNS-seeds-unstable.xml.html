    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Michael Wozniak and Alex Kotenko discusses the issue of operating multiple DNS seeds from one daemon instance. The current dnsseed daemon can only serve one name at a time, which means that two IP addresses are required to operate testnet and mainnet seeds simultaneously. Alex is seeking help with this issue as buying another IP address would be costly. Michael suggests setting up two daemons listening local on different ports and using a separate daemon or normal DNS server that proxies incoming queries to either domain. However, this will require custom software that understands the DNS protocol and can proxy it correctly based on actual incoming DNS queries. Andreas Schildbach confirms that Alex's plan to set up a DNS seed for mainnet and testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me respectively, as well as a well-connected node for both, sounds great and offers to test it out.</p>
