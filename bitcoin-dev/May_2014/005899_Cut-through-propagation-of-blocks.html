    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers on May 25, 2014, concerns were raised regarding possible attacks on the network. One issue was the possibility of a 'teergrube attack' where an attacker aims to fill the network with empty blocks by not sending the block body, while another was the potential for an attacker to subjugate the entire network with a DoS attack via cut-through forwarding of blocks. Developers also discussed ways to optimize block propagation and latency, including implementing a protocol allowing for multiplexing of messages and a separate mesh router specifically designed for low-latency transmission of blocks. Additionally, it was suggested that separating transport protocols could improve robustness and feature velocity.</p>
