    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn stated that most companies have banned their staff from reading patents. However, it was argued that applying the same patent protocols to Bitcoin as in Google is a false equivalence between the two. Google can survive single or triple damages and hopes that patents they violate will attract only single damages. In contrast, Bitcoin has a narrower scope than trying to take over the world. If even single damages result in commercial death, then one should pay attention to patents to reduce the chances of accidentally running into one. The right answer for Bitcoin is not as obvious as it may seem because it's all about money and a patent infringement suit might not result in commercial death. A transcript link was provided for more information.</p>
