    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 15, 2014, Andreas Schildbach raised concerns about the instability of the Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure. According to Schildbach, the issue could be due to the use of a custom DNS implementation that is not entirely compatible. Bugs in the past, such as a case-sensitive match for the domain name, have also contributed to the problem. The current state of the seeds was listed, with some being marked as OK and others as SERVFAIL. Telefonica, one of Europe's largest ISPs, was noted to have encountered issues with the testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org seed. Schildbach expressed a desire to fix the situation but lacked the C writing skills necessary to do so. Suggestions were made to include more seeders and enable zone transfers so that existing seeders can spread their records to multiple servers running standard DNS servers like bind etc.</p>
