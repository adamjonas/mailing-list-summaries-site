    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin DNS seed infrastructure is facing instability issues due to the usage of a custom DNS implementation that is not entirely compatible. Gregory Maxwell suggests that software using DNS seeds in a way where one or two being unavailable is problematic might be doing so poorly. DNS seeds should only be used as fast connectivity hints, mainly for initial connectivity. Relying on them exclusively increases isolation vulnerabilities as attackers can replace results with ones that isolate users on a bogus network. Clients should be robust regarding DNS lookups, but maintaining a quality infrastructure is also necessary. Andreas Schildbach raised this issue again, stating there have been past bugs such as a case-sensitive match for the domain name. He believes the first step needs to maintain a quality infrastructure.</p>
