    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke's server has been experiencing issues with ipv4 routing, in addition to DNS problems. On May 16, 2014, Rob Golding reported that dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org was experiencing a SERVFAIL error and had been tried by multiple ISPs. The authoritative server for the domain, jun.dashjr.org, was not responding to DNS queries at the time. Similarly, testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org was also experiencing a SERVFAIL error, but only from Telefonica. Rob suggested that these issues may be due to "common" firewall, transit, or connectivity issues, and offered to help organize a highly redundant DNS for any required domains.</p>
