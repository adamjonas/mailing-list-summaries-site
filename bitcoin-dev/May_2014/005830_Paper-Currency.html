    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation started with Andreas Schildbach asking for a solution to protect notes from unauthorized redeem if someone tries to reach a wallet with their own NFC, which could be fraudulent. Alex Kotenko suggested that the solution should not sacrifice usability as people have high expectations when it comes to paper money. Brooks Boyd chimed in with the idea that the general public is becoming more aware of the "hacker with a long range antenna" attack, and RFID-blocking wallets could solve the issue of smart credit cards making purchases while still in the wallet. He also suggested that future cash solutions should consider upgrading the wallet/purse to ensure money doesn't spend itself while in the pocket and can be conveniently removed and spent.</p>
