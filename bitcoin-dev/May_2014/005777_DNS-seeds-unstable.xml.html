    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2014, Andreas Schildbach reported an issue with the DNS seed for Bitcoin. The server, dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org, was showing a SERVFAIL error and multiple ISPs had attempted to connect without success. Schildbach suggested that this may be a routing issue, as IPv6 connections were still working. However, he also noted that the reliability of DNS seed may not be crucial as it is primarily used for bootstrapping and there are multiple servers available. Luke, the recipient of the email, did not respond in the thread.</p>
