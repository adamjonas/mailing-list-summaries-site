        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin.org's Developer Documentation has been released, consisting of an overview-level guide and a more detailed reference. The documentation includes plain-English descriptions of block chains and transactions, along with several illustrations, as well as information about wallet formats, payment processing details primarily aimed at developing payment-receiving applications for merchants, and a description of every RPC included in Bitcoin Core 0.9 augmented with actual examples of the command in use. With over 2,000 cross-references in the text, the current version is approximately 130 pages long. Improvements to the text are being worked on currently by volunteers who are adding an average of 200 lines of text each day. Expert reviewers are needed, and issues can be opened on the main Bitcoin.org repository. The work was done by volunteers who are always looking for more contributors.</p>
