    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jameson Lopp created a public Statoshi instance with a better interface than an integrated stats/monitoring feature. Wladimir, while appreciating the graphs in the 'connected peers' chart, suggested adding some random stats such as the number of connected peers that are SPV clients or full nodes (NODE_NETWORK), current block height, the number of transactions in mempool and UTXO set, fee statistics, number of orphan blocks/orphan transactions. Josh Lehan brainstormed the idea of adding the ping time from one node to other peers, however, fitting it into the current design would be a challenge since the graphs seem to be comprised of overall statistics for this node and not per-peer statistics that can vary between peers. There is currently no support for overlapping pings, and something would have to send the "ping" RPC command regularly to ensure the graph is updated with new information.</p>
