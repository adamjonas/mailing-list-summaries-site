    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Charlie Shrem has shared his 9-step guide for installing a full node in a universal way. The guide can be accessed through the link provided on CharlieShrem.com. In an email conversation between Jameson Lopp and Wladimir, they discuss the possibility of offering statistics with the installer for running a wallet-less node as an OS background service. Lopp mentions using Graphite, which is a Django app, to generate charts and chose StatsD because it sends stats via UDP, which does not affect the node's performance. However, he also notes that the route he has taken has dependencies on several other pieces of software to do all the heavy lifting of stats aggregation and chart rendering. As an optional tool, it should be external and not part of bitcoind itself.</p>
