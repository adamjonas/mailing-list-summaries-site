    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the use of address version in Bitcore, and whether it would be too much work to change it. The network is guessed from the address version in several places in the code, so they do not want to change it. However, the proposal is to change all of the address versions in regtest mode to be unique so they are no longer identical to testnet. It is suggested that existing tools outside of pull tester may expect regtest to have testnet addresses, so it is important to know if any existing tools would need to be modified to support this change to regtest. Mike Hearn confirms that bitcoinj supports and uses regtest mode but would also have to be changed. He asks for a rationale for the change and what the cost of having them be the same would be. Warren Togami proposes changing the address versions in regtest mode, and seeks feedback on whether any existing tools would need to be modified to support this change to regtest. The email ends with an advertisement for SauceLabs and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
