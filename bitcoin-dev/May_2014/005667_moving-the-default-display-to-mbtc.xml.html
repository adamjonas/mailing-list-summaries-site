    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, the idea of attaching SI prefixes to the currency unit is discussed. The argument against it is that no other world currency uses such prefixes and it would be unclear what amount is being referred to. Instead, it is suggested that there should be one base unit that is not modified with SI prefixes. However, Luke Dashjr argues that 'k' and 'M' are SI prefixes and people do use them in everyday transactions. He points out that SI units have never been universally adopted and many naturally-adopted units factor to twos and threes. The discussion also mentions that using bits as a factor (i.e. one million bits) is simple to understand and easy to say. It is suggested that M-bits, kilobits, millibits, etc will not be used in everyday transactions. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities of adopting a standardized format for Bitcoin amounts.</p>
