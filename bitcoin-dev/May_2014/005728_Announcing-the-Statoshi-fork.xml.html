    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Wladimir and Mike Hearn on May 7, 2014, the idea of exporting stats over regular TCP was discussed. This would allow anyone to listen to the stats feed for any node. Wladimir mentioned that the TOR network already does this and provided a link to torstatus.blutmagie.de. However, he was unsure about what TOR used to submit and gather statistics.The TOR network is based on a centralized (or in theory, federated) trusted directory service. More information on this can be found in the dir-spec.txt file available on gitweb.torproject.org. Much of the data that is not related to relays is generated by probes, such as semi-trusted bandwidth authorities that measure node performance back to the directory authorities.Further information on TOR's monitoring work can be found at metrics.torproject.org/tools.html.</p>
