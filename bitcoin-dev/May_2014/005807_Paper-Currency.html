    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about generating space-efficient QR codes, it was noted that binary QR codes cannot be used to auto-dispatch to apps on Android, so encoding data as a URI in an alphanumeric mode QR code is necessary. The speaker has implemented this in Bitcoin Wallet for efficient encoding of transactions and BIP70 payment requests into QR codes using an algorithm he calls Base43, which uses the same algorithm as Base58 or Base64. In another discussion, Jerry Felix proposed a standard for a paper currency that is counterfeit-resistant, inexpensive to print, internationally recognized (border-less), fits in a wallet, and machine-readable. He presented the idea in provisional BIP format, numbered BIP-80 to BIP-84, and invited feedback from the group. The proposal received interest and was not laughed out of the discussion.</p>
