    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Kotenko sought help with setting up a DNS seed for mainnet and testnet using different daemons. However, he faced an issue where the dnsseed daemon could not serve more than one name at once. Andreas Schildbach suggested that Alex set up a DNS seed by himself using the bitcoin-seeder daemon. Alex proposed to set up DNS seeds for mainnet and testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me, respectively, and also a well-connected node for both mainnet and testnet on the same server. It was confirmed that this would be helpful as there were no working DNS seeds at testnet3. The links provided include the github repository for bitcoin-seeder, the URLs for the DNS seeds, and the mailing list details.</p>
