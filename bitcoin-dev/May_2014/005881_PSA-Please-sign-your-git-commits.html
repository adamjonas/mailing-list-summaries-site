    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A contributor to Bitcoin Core development, Chris, has responded to a request from Wladimir to sign git commits. He agrees with the idea but asks if Wladimir had considered the arguments against commit signing and provides links to these. Chris also suggests adding a `git config` option to enable signing by default as many contributors may forget to do this. However, he questions whether this would create an unnecessary barrier to contribution. Wladimir had previously sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list requesting that all contributors sign their git commits using the `-S` flag or `--gpg-sign`. He provides instructions on how to sign commits, retroactively sign previous commits, and check if commits are signed using `git log --show-signature`. Wladimir mentions that he is often the only person signing commits and encourages more people to make it a habit. He also provides instructions on how to sign merges using a script developed by Pieter Wullie found in contrib/devtools. Finally, Wladimir reminds contributors to use the script when possible for merging instead of the GitHub interface.</p>
