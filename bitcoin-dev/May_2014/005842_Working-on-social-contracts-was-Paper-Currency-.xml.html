    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent by Justus Ranvier to Gavin Andresen, he suggested that they should work on a Bitcoin social contract. This contract would promise what features will never be added or taken away from Bitcoin. However, Andresen expressed confusion over why he and Mike would have the authority to write such a contract for future-Bitcoin. He believed that the only social contract was the decentralized one already in place - if someone didn't like something about the code, they could simply not download or run it or fork it if they were able. Andresen did believe that as the person who started the mailing list, he had the authority to enforce a social contract of "no trolling or flaming or name-calling" on the list. He expressed a desire to delegate this authority, preferably to a software algorithm that could automatically censor unproductive discussions or contributors. He also reminded the group to change the subject line when topics wandered.</p>
