    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the UK, unincorporated businesses or sole traders are unable to obtain EV (Extended Validation) certificates due to the absence of a trade register. However, this does not pose a significant concern as they can easily trade under their name, email address, domain name or even telephone number if an SMS verifying CA is set up. The purpose of these certificates is simply to avoid confusion and ensure payments are directed to the correct entity. On the other hand, companies that are unable to obtain EV certificates may indirectly cause confusion amongst users and make them uncertain about payment expectations, potentially making it easier for confusion attacks to occur. Nonetheless, this is expected to be a minor issue in practice.</p>
