    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 27, 2014, Andreas Schildbach wrote about the issue of debugging the seed infrastructure and suggested that someone volunteers to fix it. He mentions that he only received funds to cover expenses and a trivial amount on top to cover some time. Gavin, in response, wants to give back the grant funds for running a seed since his work will keep him out of the country frequently and he will not be able to provide more than a "best effort" attempt at running a seed. He has no plans to take it down, but the expectations users have for it aren't something he can provide.In the subsequent conversation, there is a discussion about verifying whether the copy of the seeder contains the commit 8dcc006e6256cb746c2b025daf3df41baa26353e, which fixed a bug that had exactly the same symptoms as those currently seen. The restart of the server does not seem to have changed or fixed anything, and this could be because the server was being accessed through parts of the world that cannot reach it.</p>
