    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Alex Kotenko has reported a problem with his DNS settings to Robert McKay. He is unable to figure out the problem even after using dig and nslookup commands. Robert suggests that the 'aa' flag is missing in the reply which causes the recursor to go into a loop chasing the authority server, resulting in a non-authoritative answer with itself as the authority again. He also mentions that bind is stripping off the authorative answer bit in the reply and he cannot see any way to make that happen in the bind configuration. Alex wonders if setting up a custom SOA record would help but Robert warns him against using it as a solution for some resolvers. In conclusion, the discussion revolves around the problem of DNS settings for seeds and how it can be resolved.</p>
