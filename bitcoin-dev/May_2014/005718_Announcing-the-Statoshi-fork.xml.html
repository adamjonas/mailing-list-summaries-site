    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent on 05/07/2014, Mike Hearn praises a proposal and suggests putting together an operations team to simplify the process of setting up monitored bitcoind systems. He wonders if there are ways to simplify the setup process, such as running a community StatsD and Graphite instance. Jameson responds agreeing that the current setup is too difficult to implement for most users. He notes that while StatsD is designed to sample small amounts of stats from high volume systems, there would be an issue of trust if it was run outside of highly secure infrastructure where you trust all of the machines that are talking to it. He also clarifies that StatsD is not a small UNIX daemon, but rather a Javascript tool.</p>
