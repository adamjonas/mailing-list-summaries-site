    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, Mike Hearn raised the issue of network rate limiting in Bitcoin Core. He mentioned that while it is important to have this feature, implementing it is not an easy task. Additionally, he noted that even if implemented, throttling one's connection would cause remote nodes to give up and hit other unthrottled peers even more. This led Bjørn Øivind to inquire if adding a node with slow upstream/downstream speed could harm the network. He also asked for the recommended minimum amount of bandwidth allocation for a node and shared that he had already throttled his node with QoS based on the script in the contrib/ folder.</p>
