    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the naming of Bitcoin units. The proposal to use "bits" as a unit name for 1e-6 BTC is being criticized as confusing and ambiguous by some members of the mailing list. They argue that people without a background in computer science or Bitcoin would find it difficult to understand the terminology. The current names for things related to Bitcoin, such as mining and wallet, are already confusing enough. Additionally, there are concerns that the word "bit" already has a different meaning as a binary digit, which could further cause confusion among users. Some members suggested creating a new one-syllable word instead, with "zib" being proposed as a possible option. Unicode symbol U+0180, lowercase b with stroke, was suggested as a representation for microBTC denomination. However, other members argue that people will naturally develop colloquial names and that developers should not dictate what those names should be.</p>
