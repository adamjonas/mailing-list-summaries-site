    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Raúl Martínez and Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, discussed various features and changes that could be made to Bitcoin Core. One feature suggested was to allow users to view the bandwidth used by Bitcoin Core for transparency purposes. However, there were concerns that this could cause some users to turn off their node if they saw bigger than expected numbers. Another suggestion was to create a bitcoin.conf file on the first use of bitcoind and Bitcoin Core, but it was suggested that example configs would be more helpful. It was also recommended that bitcoind and Bitcoin Core should be included in Linux repositories with certain conditions, such as allowing bitcoin devs to dictate which dependent libs are shipped with the binaries/libs. There was also a suggestion to create a "grafical interface" for bitcoind on Linux servers, similar to the "top" command but in ASCII characters. The best approach for this was considered to be exporting raw statistics from bitcoind and then creating an interface based on those numbers. Another suggestion was to split Bitcoin Wallet from Bitcoin Node, which was already in progress with the implementation of disable-wallet support at compile time or runtime. Additionally, there was a suggestion to inform users if port 8333 was closed and to keep connections if bitcoind was restarted, but Jeff Garzik advised against the latter as it was not always possible and could cause issues.</p>
