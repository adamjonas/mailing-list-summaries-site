    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Andreas Schildbach, Todd apologized for not being able to fix an issue with the seeder due to his consulting job requiring travel. Schildbach pointed out that others who run software that's been around for 30 years are not criticized as quickly as Todd does, despite the protocol not changing during that time. He also suggested adding logging to the seeder and using DNS over HTTPS. Todd confirmed that he didn't have time to fix the issue and asked if Schildbach's copy of the seeder contained a specific commit to fix the problem. Schildbach responded that he was already volunteering, but didn't receive payment for debugging the seed infrastructure. He also asked if Todd had tried the seeder at home before restarting it, suggesting that a SERVFAIL may be due to Todd's travel locations rather than a bug in the seeder.</p>
