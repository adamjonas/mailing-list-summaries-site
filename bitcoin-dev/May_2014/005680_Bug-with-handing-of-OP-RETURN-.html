    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about a pull request which suggests minimizing the impact on the blockchain. The current implementation using template matching appears to be more complex than if a simple check was made to see if the first item in the script is an OP_RETURN and if it has a size greater than zero. Mark Friedenbach does not think that such a pull request would be accepted because each extra txout adds 9 bytes minimum with no benefit over serializing the data together in a single OP_RETURN.However, in this case, it is not a question of extra txouts but instead, it is a question of additional pushes. There may be some push overhead, but the only issue that arises is extra complexity in the IsStandard rule. The writer questions why this matters as the application already needs to define the meaning of the data. The point is made that there is no benefit in making hash commitment less uniform with the rest of the network.</p>
