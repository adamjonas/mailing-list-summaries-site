    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Andy Alness has discussed the possibility of extending the protocol to support UDP transport. This would enable NAT traversal and allow many more people to run effective nodes. The idea was welcomed by Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, who said that UDP traversal of the P2P protocol seems reasonable for "inv" messages. However, in response to a query from Eugen Leitl, Gmail expressed doubts about whether a blockchain fork due to network split could happen because it is unlikely that any significant portion of miners in China will continue to mine on a China-specific chain since it will eventually be outmined by non-Chinese miners and orphaned. Instead, mining interests in China are more likely to make special arrangements to circumvent the Great Firewall of China (GFwOC). Users who can't access the worldwide blockchain will notice horrendously slow confirmation times and other side effects. In conclusion, there was a discussion about the possibility of UDP traversal of the P2P protocol to support NAT traversal and for many more people to run effective nodes in the Bitcoin development mailing list. There were also doubts expressed regarding the possibility of a blockchain fork due to network split.</p>
