    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Andreas Schildbach raised the question of how to protect notes from unauthorized redeem in an NFC wallet. The concern was that a fraudulent person with a custom-built long-range NFC antenna might try to reach someone's wallet. Alex Kotenko responded by saying that the solution cannot sacrifice usability as paper money has a high standard of expectations in this area. Meanwhile, Brooks suggested that the general public is becoming more aware of hacker attacks and demonstrated how RFID-blocking wallets are available on the market. The wallet upgrade would ensure that money does not spend itself while it is in your pocket.</p>
