    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated May 3, 2014, Ben Davenport noted that quoting amounts as "63 k$" or "3 M$" is not the accepted standard in the US. Instead, the currency symbol is written in front of the amount (i.e., "$63k" or "$3M"). Jannis responded by suggesting that the reason for this is because in the US, the currency symbol is written in front of the amount. Additionally, Jannis argued that SI prefixes can be confusing because the prefixes for values less than 1 are often less well-known. While most people know that "kilo" means 1000 and "mega" means 1,000,000, few people know that "micro" means 0.000001, and those who do tend to confuse it with "nano".</p>
