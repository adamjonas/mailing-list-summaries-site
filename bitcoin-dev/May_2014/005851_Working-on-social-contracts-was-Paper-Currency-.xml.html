    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about making promises regarding the development of Bitcoin, Justus Ranvier argues that personal promises are not reliable as people change and can be coerced. Instead, he suggests that the community should focus on building robust social and technical infrastructure to prevent failures and attacks. He encourages developers to spend time reviewing technical work to improve security and create unbreakable rules embodied in the software. Justus believes that Bitcoin should be a trustless system ruled by free will and understanding. He acknowledges that people may assume he is constantly being evil and trying to sneak something in, but this will only improve technology and security. He urges for respectful communication without personal attacks to uncover actual attacks.</p>
