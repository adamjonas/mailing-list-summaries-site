    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion has been made to teach the seeder or bitcoind how to write a zone file and use matured DNS servers to serve this zone. The idea is that it would be easy for everyone to use stock server software if implemented successfully. Pieter Wuille suggested adding support for an option to the seeder "for non-matching requests, forward to other DNS server at IP:PORT" so that they could cascade them. However, Robert McKay disagreed saying that the 'aa' flag is missing, and it might not work for some resolvers. Alex Kotenko had set up DNS seeds but was facing problems with his DNS settings which he couldn't figure out. He requested Peter's help to debug his settings by sharing how he configured DNS for his seed.</p>
