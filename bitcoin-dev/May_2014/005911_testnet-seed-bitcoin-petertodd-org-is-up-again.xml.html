    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion regarding the failure of bitcoin seeders, it was mentioned that the last time it didn't work, the bug was on the bitcoin seeders' side. It was also mentioned that without logs, there is no chance to debug this issue. The suggestion was made to add simple logging to the seeder. DNS via HTTP was suggested as an alternate method for protocol redundancy. When asked for more information about what was fixed, Peter Todd mentioned that he wasn't sure exactly but that DNS requests were not getting resolved, however, after restarted the issue was resolved. Finally, the email included an advertisement for affordable search technologies available for all companies.</p>
