    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 24.1 has been released with various bug fixes and performance improvements along with updated translations. Users can download it from the official website or through BitTorrent. The release notes suggest that users report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub and subscribe to receive security and update notifications. For upgrading, users need to shut down an older version and then run the installer on Windows or copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` on macOS or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` on Linux. Compatibility wise, Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. It should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.The release includes several improvements related to P2P, RPC and other APIs, Build System, Wallet, and GUI changes. For instance, wallet users can migrate their wallet by specifying a wallet name and passphrase, reuse change dest when re-creating TX with avoidpartialspends, and properly handle "unknown" Address Type. In addition, GUI changes include loading PSBTs using istreambuf_iterator rather than istream_iterator and correctly limiting the overview transaction list.Lastly, the release credits everyone who contributed directly or indirectly towards the release including Andrew Chow, Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, John Moffett, Jon Atack, Marco Falke, Martin Zumsande, Matthew Zipkin, Michael Ford, pablomartin4btc, Sebastian Falbesoner, Suhas Daftuar, Thomas Nguyen, Vasil Dimov, and those who helped with translations on Transifex.</p>
