    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email, the author expresses confusion about a claim made regarding pool transactions on the Ark platform and their potential for being double-spent by Ark service providers. The author questions how this would affect recipients who pay a lightning invoice with incoming zero-conf vTXOs, given that ASPs on Ark are liquidity providers, blinded coinjoin coordinators, and Lightning service providers. The author suggests that if an ASP were to replace an in-mempool transaction, they may fail to forward the payment on the broader Lightning network, preventing recipients from accessing their funds until the next pool transaction is confirmed. Additionally, the author notes that it may be difficult for one ASP to prove that another is not its sockpuppet without locking funds or doing proof-of-work.</p>
