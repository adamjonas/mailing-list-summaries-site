    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 23.2 has been released with several bug fixes and performance improvements along with updated translations. Users can download it from the official website or through BitTorrent. The release notes recommend users to shut down their older versions of Bitcoin core before upgrading to this new version. This is because, in some cases, it may take a few minutes for the software to completely shut down. Users can run the installer on Windows or copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` on Mac OS or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` on Linux to upgrade from an older version. Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its end-of-life (EOL) is possible but may take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. This new version of Bitcoin Core is compatible with operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. The update includes various bug fixes and performance improvements related to P2P, build system, and miscellaneous issues. Additionally, credits are given to those who contributed to this release, including Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, MacroFake, Martin Zumsande, Michael Ford, and Suhas Daftuar. Finally, users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub and subscribe to receive security and update notifications.</p>
