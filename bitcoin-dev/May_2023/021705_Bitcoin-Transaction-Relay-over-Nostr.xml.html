    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation above discusses the possibility of encrypting transactions while publishing them as nostr events, with the exception of certain details like size, fee rate and offer. This would enable different clients to display these transactions as an external mempool, sorted by fee rate, without compromising user privacy. However, there are concerns that encrypted transactions could be fake and distort the view clients have on the mempool.Incentives for mining pools to include these transactions in their blocks are discussed, particularly if they use a higher fee rate compared to transactions in the normal mempool used by bitcoin nodes. NIP4 is proposed as a means to privately coordinate everything between user and pool. Users can lock some sats in a 2of2 multisig and release it to the mining pool on confirmation. Out-of-band payment is suggested as an option in case the fee included in the transaction itself is insufficient and CPFP/RBF is impossible or impractical. However, the question remains whether miners would trust users to actually release the payment after confirmation. The 2-of-2 has a clawback clause with a timeout that could be used by the user to avoid paying.</p>
