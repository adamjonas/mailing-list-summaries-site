    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the aggregation of transaction proofs or recursively verifying transactions. It is questioned whether miners should be responsible for this aggregation, as it would require all fullnodes to also perform non-aggregated validation. The cost of this non-aggregated validation must be reflected in the weight and affects all fullnodes since they are considered miners with zero hashpower. To avoid increasing the cost on fullnodes, the suggestion is made to create a separate network for aggregation that does not involve Bitcoin fullnodes. Fees can then be extracted for aggregation and already-aggregated transactions can be validated in the Bitcoin mempool. It is noted that validation occurs when a transaction enters the mempool and is not re-run when an in-mempool transaction is seen in a block. The goal is to limit the validation of non-aggregated transactions by increasing the weight of heavy-validation transactions.</p>
