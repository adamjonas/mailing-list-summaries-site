    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a suggestion to have a validation check to reject witness scripts that have arbitrary data between two specific flags, OP_FALSE and OP_IF, which would prevent people from overloading the network with transactions solely for ordinals and brc-20 tokens. This would still allow all the benefits of taproot while rejecting inscriptions. The author questions if there is a reason such a validation check is a bad idea and wonders if it was an oversight that arbitrary data can be inserted between OP_FALSE and OP_IF when the size limit for witness scripts was lifted as part of taproot. The author also notes that OP_RETURN can store arbitrary data limited to 80kb.</p>
