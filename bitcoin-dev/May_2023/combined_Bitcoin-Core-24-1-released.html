        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 19, 2023, Michael Ford announced the release of Bitcoin Core version 24.1 via the bitcoin-dev mailing list. This new version can be downloaded from the official website or through BitTorrent, which includes a link with several trackers. However, one of the trackers has a typo in its subdomain: trakcer.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl instead of tracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl. Sjors noticed this error and mentioned it in a reply, promising to add the correct subdomain.Bitcoin Core version 24.1 comes with various bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. To download this version, users can visit the official website or use BitTorrent. The release notes advise users to report any bugs using the GitHub issue tracker and subscribe to receive security and update notifications. Upgrading to the new version requires shutting down the older version and then running the installer on Windows or copying over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` on macOS or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` on Linux. Compatibility-wise, Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems that use the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. While it may work on other Unix-like systems, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.The release includes several improvements across different areas such as P2P, RPC and other APIs, Build System, Wallet, and GUI changes. For example, wallet users can now migrate their wallet by specifying a wallet name and passphrase, reuse change destinations when re-creating transactions with avoidpartialspends, and handle "unknown" Address Type properly. GUI changes involve loading PSBTs using istreambuf_iterator instead of istream_iterator and correctly limiting the overview transaction list.Lastly, the release acknowledges the contributions of individuals who directly or indirectly helped with the release. This includes Andrew Chow, Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, John Moffett, Jon Atack, Marco Falke, Martin Zumsande, Matthew Zipkin, Michael Ford, pablomartin4btc, Sebastian Falbesoner, Suhas Daftuar, Thomas Nguyen, Vasil Dimov, and those who assisted with translations on Transifex. These individuals have played a significant role in the development of Bitcoin Core version 24.1.</p>
