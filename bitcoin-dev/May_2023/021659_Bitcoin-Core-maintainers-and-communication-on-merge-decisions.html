    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the process of blocking a potential maintainer in the Bitcoin Core project. Michael Folkson expresses his concern that current maintainers will decide which proposed new maintainers to add and which to block, with no clear explanation given for the reasons behind the decision. Steve Lee argues that the same process was used for both Vasil and Russ, but Michael disagrees, stating that the process for Vasil was different from that of Russ. The process for Vasil involved keeping his pull request open for up to 5 months with zero negative acknowledgments (NACKs), followed by a later justification for blocking it that they've refused to discuss whether it applies to Russ, while the process for Russ was the maintainers deciding privately there was a need for a maintainer "who understood our interfaces and modularization efforts well" and his pull request was merged within 2 days. Michael emphasizes that his concern is not a criticism of Russ and highlights that the precedent set could mean future potential maintainers can be blocked for unknown and/or potentially inconsistent reasons by the existing maintainers.</p>
