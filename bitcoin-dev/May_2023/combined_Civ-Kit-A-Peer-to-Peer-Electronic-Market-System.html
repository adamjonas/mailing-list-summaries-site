        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>CivKit is a peer-to-peer marketplace that facilitates censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The platform combines the Nostr architecture with Lightning onion routing infrastructure to ensure confidentiality for market participants. Market boards, which are Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, serve as the operating mechanism for the marketplace. While market boards can be run as a federation, they do not log a decentralized orderbook on the blockchain. Instead, trades in CivKit are escrowed under Bitcoin Script contracts and rely on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication.To score trades, counterparties, and service operators, the researchers propose a Web-of-Stakes framework. This framework assigns economic weight to each market entity based on the Bitcoin UTXO set, providing a trustless source of truth. Additionally, reputation can be enhanced using decentralized identifiers from the Web-of-Trust. Incentives for service operators focus on efficiency through privacy-preserving credentials backed by Bitcoin payments, following the principles of IETF's Privacy Pass.The issue of front-running, where a board exploits advance knowledge of market offers, is addressed in the context. To mitigate this risk, offer announcements can be duplicated to multiple boards, monitoring latency for anomalies, and disqualifying misbehaving boards. Another approach is to run boards as a federation using techniques like Honey Badger BFT, where consensus must be reached before announcing offers.Overall, CivKit aims to provide a flexible framework for peer-to-peer trading with customizable front-running resistance parameters. While the design prioritizes on-ramp/off-ramp trading, it can also support other types of trading such as goods, services, and bitcoin financial derivatives. The success of the marketplace relies on identifying desired products for trading and delivering a good user experience.The team behind CivKit, including Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory, and Ray Youssef, is actively working on the development of this peer-to-peer market system. They plan to release code and modules gradually, building upon existing libraries such as the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr. Collaboration with the community is encouraged to standardize libraries and ensure interoperability between clients. Feedback on their work is also welcomed. The whitepaper provides comprehensive details about the architecture of CivKit and proposes innovative solutions to various challenges.</p>
