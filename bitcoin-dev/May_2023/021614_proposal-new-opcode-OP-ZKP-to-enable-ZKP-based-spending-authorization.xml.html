    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Weiji and ZmnSCPxj, the possibility of an attack on the fullnode mempool network was discussed. The attack involves flooding the network with non-aggregated transactions and then confirming a single aggregated transaction with a lower feerate in cooperation with a miner. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that this is not a feasible attack as it would require generating proofs for 1000 transactions and paying upfront for 1000*X. Additionally, the aggregation vendor would need to spend more computing power doing the aggregation and take (1000*X - Y) as profit, while the miner receives Y. To prevent overload on the free mempool service, there needs to be a separate, paid aggregator outside the mempool. If aggregation is paid for, it would be sufficient to stop the attack.</p>
