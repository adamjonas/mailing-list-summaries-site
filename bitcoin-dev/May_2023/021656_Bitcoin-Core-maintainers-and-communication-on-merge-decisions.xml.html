    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on blocking Vasil as a maintainer in the Bitcoin Core project was brought up on a GitHub pull request. The process of expressing views and giving reasons for NACKs is being used. However, concerns were raised about the precedent this sets for future potential maintainers being blocked for unknown or inconsistent reasons by existing maintainers. There is also a question of the extent to which the rationale for blocking Vasil applies to other potential maintainers. In response to a suggestion that anyone can express their view on the PR, it was noted that the issue is more complex than that. The controls on GitHub are merely because that is how the platform works; however, there is a concern that people may confuse Bitcoin Core with the bitcoin protocol in general. The governance structure of Bitcoin Core is different from that of many organizations, as it is a volunteer project of independent contributors merging different pull requests or patches. Overall, this raises questions about the governance and decision-making processes of the Bitcoin Core project.</p>
