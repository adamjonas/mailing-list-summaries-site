    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is regarding the process of blocking certain maintainers from contributing to the Bitcoin Core project. Michael Folkson expressed concerns about how current maintainers are deciding which proposed new maintainers to add and which to block, without discussing the rationale for blocking Vasil as a maintainer and whether it applies or doesn't apply to Ryanofsky (or future potential maintainers). Steve Lee argued that anyone, in particular Core project contributors, can express their view in this PR. Bryan Bishop added that Bitcoin Core is a volunteer project of independent contributors merging different pull requests or patches, and that the Github controls are merely because that is how Github works. There is also a secondary issue of people tending to confuse Bitcoin Core with the Bitcoin protocol in general.</p>
