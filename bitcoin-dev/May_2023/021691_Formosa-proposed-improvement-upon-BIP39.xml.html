    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Yuri S VB has proposed a password format as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that improves upon BIP39 by allowing meaningful, themed sentences with a regular grammatical structure instead of semantically disconnected words while keeping the same entropy/checksum and total bits/non-repeating leading digits ratios. This process would be necessary to "extend" BIP39 rather than "replace" it. To sidestep the need to get everyone in the ecosystem to adopt a new standard, the process should be able to output a standard BIP39 seed sequence. Themes may prove to make this harder to solve. The benefits afforded by the themes are little by comparison. The largest value proposition of these schemes is that it allows significant wallet interoperability. Anecdotal experiments suggest that less than one hour of moderate concentration is enough for long term memorization of 128 + 4 bits if a theme of interest is employed. A user willing to avoid the additional vulnerability to coercion that an effective brain wallet would ensue could just not put up the effort to memorize the seed for long term and just take advantage of the easier transcription and checking.</p>
