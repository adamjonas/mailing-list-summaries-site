    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The question of whether it is possible to change the "max fee" in transactions to output amounts is raised. While it is technically possible, it may not be the best solution as it could potentially lead to multiple transactions with small fees instead of one transaction with a larger fee. This could be seen as spam or DOS activity. Additionally, there are other solutions that could be implemented, such as rejecting transactions where the fee is higher than the sum of the outputs. However, this could also lead to multiple transactions and ultimately increase network congestion. Therefore, before attempting to improve the current system, it is important to consider whether it is even possible to avoid the "max fee rule".</p>
