        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Yuri S VB has proposed a new password format in a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that improves upon BIP39 by allowing meaningful, themed sentences with a regular grammatical structure instead of semantically disconnected words while maintaining the same entropy/checksum and total bits/non-repeating leading digits ratios. The proposal aims to extend BIP39 rather than replace it and can output a standard BIP39 seed sequence to sidestep the need for everyone in the ecosystem to adopt a new standard. The proposal is available on GitHub, and Yuri S VB invites colleagues for scrutiny and feedback.In Toptal's Technology Blog, Yuri explains that Formosa uses a simple fixed grammatical structure for sentences, allowing for easy implementation, customized themes, and keeping legacy BIP39 properties. This leads to efficient auto-complete and resistance to side-channel attacks. However, there may be concerns about increased memorability making $5 wrench attacks more viable. Yuri argues that knowledge-based authentication still has some properties that possession-based authentication doesn't and that mitigating the shortcomings of KBA can arguably be done better with 2FA, instead of PBA. Yuri also touches upon loss of Bitcoin at a higher rate than it is mined and how non-technical individuals who adopt Bitcoin can feel emotional pain when they lose their patrimony. He argues that we should build a solution for coercion-resistance that is not reliant on obscurity. To this day, there is no scheme, protocol, or ceremony that simultaneously achieves self-custody and coercion resistance with non-obscurity. Yuri plans to make a thread about this critical issue shortly.</p>
