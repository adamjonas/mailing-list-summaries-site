        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The paper titled "Blockrate Binaries on Bitcoin mainnet" introduces the Powswap protocol which involves using hashrate derivatives as off-chain contracts between two users for creating peer-to-peer binary contracts on future block discovery rates. The paper covers the protocol steps in detail, along with the threat model and potential contentions and transaction confirmation racing in edge cases. It also discusses infrastructure for counterparty discovery and selection with the potential usage of Discreet Log Contracts or other protocols. The Blockrate Binary Options could be implemented on top of Lightning payment channels, but further protocol design is needed to establish whether these options would be useful financial tools for Bitcoin users. However, they may prove beneficial for miners for hedging their operations, providing a decentralized price indicator, and enabling derivative trading. The authors invite protocol researchers, experienced core, and lightning software developers to address any remaining blockers. Private inquiries can be directed to the author's email.</p>
