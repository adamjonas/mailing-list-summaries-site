    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal for BIP125 is to allow transactions to opt into replaceability to create a more efficient fee market place, with the primary use case being to increase fees for unconfirmed transactions. However, one individual has questioned the desirability of this proposal, suggesting that it is better to simply replace the unconfirmed payment rather than trying to increase the fees. It is also argued that spending an unconfirmed payment from a third party is reckless and something that Core never does. Furthermore, it is suggested that asking miners to ignore these spends goes against their income, making the network behavior unstable and potentially leading to higher volatility. Instead, it is proposed that a BIP be created which strongly advises parties to not spend unconfirmed outputs from third parties while making a payment to third parties in order to achieve the same end.</p>
