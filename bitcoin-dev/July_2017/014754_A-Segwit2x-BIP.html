    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr expressed his belief that a hardfork attempt for Bitcoin would fail even with the support of Core. This statement raises questions about why he thinks this would be the case, and what "fail" means in this context. Despite Core's support, many people would still oppose the hardfork, which could lead to its failure. It is unclear what actions those opposing the hardfork could take, with or without Core's support. In addition to discussing Bitcoin, the email also provides links to resources for Zcash wallets and Bitcoin wallets, as well as a torrent dynamic blocklist and a 10 million password list. There are also links to anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklists, Peersm, torrent-live, and node-Tor, all hosted on GitHub.</p>
