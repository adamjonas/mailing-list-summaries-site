    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Paul Sztorc defends Drivechain, a proposed solution for interoperability between blockchains. He argues that it is unfair to characterize Drivechain as an unmistakable weakening of Bitcoin's security guarantees, as users have to opt into using Drivechains and other outputs such as P2PKH/Multisig are unaffected. However, he admits that Drivechain outputs have a different security model than other contracts as they are controlled by miners. Tao Effect, another member of the discussion, argues that the security of the sidechains allows miners to steal bitcoins, which they cannot do currently. Greg Slepak also joins the discussion and claims that there is no reason to weaken Bitcoin's security in such a dramatic fashion and better options are being worked on. The conversation briefly touches on issues of theft and censorship in relation to Bitcoin's security guarantees.</p>
