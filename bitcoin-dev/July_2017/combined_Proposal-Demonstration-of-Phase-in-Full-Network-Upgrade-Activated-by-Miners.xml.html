        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation on June 13, 2017, Zheming Lin proposed a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that was written in both Chinese and English. The proposal addressed issues with non-mining wallet nodes and their passive upgrade practices. However, another participant in the conversation pointed out that non-mining wallet nodes were considered from the very beginning of Bitcoin's software development and their upgrade practices are not slower than miners. Additionally, the white paper specifically describes the enforcement of system rules by users broadly, not just miners. The participant also stated that miners are sometimes the ones who are "passive and lazy" in upgrading, and many do not run a node at all. Despite this, the participant did not believe that slow upgrades were a problem as reliability cannot be maintained if infrastructure is rapidly changing. The email also discussed the drawbacks of switching to a Proof of Stake system and the importance of competition in the Bitcoin economy. Finally, the email asserted that hard forks are not dangerous and that the security of Bitcoin is based on the probability of transactions being reverted or changed.</p>
