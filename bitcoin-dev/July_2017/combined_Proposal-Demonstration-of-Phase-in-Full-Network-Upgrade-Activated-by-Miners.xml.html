        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made to upgrade Bitcoin's protocol in four stages. The first stage involves a new versionbits in block headers that would orphan blocks with old versionbits, requiring only a majority of miners to signal their support for activation. Non-mining nodes are not affected during the two grace periods, giving them enough time to upgrade their software. However, concerns have been raised about false signaling by miners and wallet nodes, as well as backward compatibility. The proposed method involves incorporating upgrades that affect non-mining nodes, with miners orphaning the minor to ensure all miners upgrade.The conversation between Zheming Lin and Jameson Lopp revolves around the issue of user choice in Bitcoin upgrades and how users can express their opinions. The white paper refers to majority hashpower needing to be honest with regard to determining the correct chain within the context of many possible valid chain forks. The proposed mechanism for coordinated user participation activation thresholds would allow users to coordinate changes independently of miners and with very high consensus levels.Consensus in the Bitcoin ecosystem is critical for its security and reliability, and users have the choice to participate or leave. The proposed plan seeks to incentivize and protect both mining and non-mining nodes during upgrades, provide additional incentives for wallet nodes to upgrade their protocols, and ensure a smooth and gradual protocol upgrade that protects all nodes in the Bitcoin network. The risks associated with fluctuation of hashing power affecting the result of the longest chain, false signaling from miners, and conspiring between miners and non-mining nodes to fork using old protocol consensus can be reduced by upgrading most passive non-mining nodes.The article discusses the risks involved in upgrading Bitcoin, particularly with regards to the possibility of forking. Upgrades can result in fluctuations in hashing power which can affect the longest chain, and miners and non-mining nodes may work together to fork using old protocol consensus. There is also the potential for miners to signal falsely to avoid being orphaned. Gregory Maxwell argues that slow upgrades are not necessarily a problem, and upgrading too fast can jeopardize reliability.The discussion concludes with a suggestion that a common understanding of Bitcoin be established through the white paper. Overall, the article highlights the importance of careful consideration and planning when it comes to upgrading Bitcoin to avoid any negative consequences.</p>
