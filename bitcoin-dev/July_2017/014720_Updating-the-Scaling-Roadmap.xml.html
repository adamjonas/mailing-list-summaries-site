    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Paul Sztorc, a Bitcoin developer, has suggested that the 2015 scaling roadmap is outdated and needs to be revised. The scaling roadmap was successful in synchronising the Bitcoin community and getting everyone back to work on solving issues related to scalability, but given that it is now 19 months old, Sztorc believes it should be updated. He suggests removing what has been accomplished, introducing new innovations and approaches, and updating deadlines and projections. The new roadmap would include technologies that increase bitcoin's maximum transactions per second rate (capacity) or make it easier to process a higher volume of transactions (scalability).Sztorc's draft of the new roadmap includes completed items such as VersionBits (BIP 9), Compact Blocks (BIP 152), FIBRE Network, Check Sequence Verify (BIP 112), Segregated Witness (BIP 141) and Lightning Network, while including new upcoming improvements like Transaction Compression, Schnorr Signature Aggregation and Drivechain. If these capacity improvements outlined above are not sufficient, then it may be necessary to use a hard fork to increase the blocksize by a moderate amount.Sztorc welcomes feedback on his draft and encourages edits to be made. He also emphasises the need for an updated roadmap, even if one does not sign it, because a refusal to sign would still be informative.</p>
