    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The blocktime-based thresholds in BIP9 have been criticized for being confusing and vulnerable to miners manipulating timestamps. This could prevent or delay activation of the threshold, but would also result in a dramatic increase in difficulty. In contrast, height-based thresholds are more certain at a given block height and easier to monitor. However, predicting the exact date of activation is difficult due to fluctuations in difficulty. The proposal's author is willing to amend BIP8 to be height-based if there is sufficient interest, as it would be a trivial amendment now that the proposal has been widely reviewed.</p>
