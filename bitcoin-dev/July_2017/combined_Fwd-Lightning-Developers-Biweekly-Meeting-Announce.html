        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Developers working on the Lightning protocol have started formalizing their previously informal Google Hangout, which is held every two weeks. The call will take place on Mondays every two weeks at 20:00 UTC, with the next call scheduled for July 24th. Those who want to attend can send a message to Rusty Russell, who will add them to the invite. Communication during the call will be through #lightning-dev on freenode's IRC servers. Russell will produce an agenda of outstanding pull requests on Github and minutes each week, which will be posted to the mailing list. Moving forward, all non-spelling/typo changes to the specification will require a vote, with no objections from call participants. If a developer is unable to make it to the meeting, they may veto or defer by emailing Russell in writing before the call takes place.</p>
