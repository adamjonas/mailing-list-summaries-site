    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent and Ignotus Peverell, a developer on MimbleWimble, Cohen shared his thoughts on proofs of position and provided a link to his talk on the subject. Peverell responded with his appreciation for the link and mentioned that they arrived at similar conclusions regarding the hash function while working on a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR). He also noted that MMRs are append-only and make pruning easy, which works well for MimbleWimble. Peverell expressed interest in proof of positions but said he would look into it when they're less busy implementing everything else. Bryan Bishop, another developer on MimbleWimble, joined the conversation and shared a link to some recent comments made by Bram about Blake, the hash function being considered for MimbleWimble.</p>
