    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Dan Libby expressed his desire to run Bitcoin software without support for Segregated Witness (SegWit). He noted that it is not simple to disable SegWit correctly and that it isn't a supported configuration. Maxwell, one of the core developers of Bitcoin, asked why Dan wants to disable SegWit and suggested that there should be no adverse impact if he doesn't use it. Dan explained that he has nothing against SegWit per-se but prefers fixed, unchanging consensus rules, limited bandwidth and resources, and more recent features. He also views it as a personal challenge and experiment. Maxwell stated that the only reason he knows for intentionally not running with SegWit support is to temporarily have as your tip block a block that was actively stealing the SegWit transactions of a third party, which is neither personally nor publicly desirable. However, he admits that he may be missing some good reasons that he is not aware of.</p>
