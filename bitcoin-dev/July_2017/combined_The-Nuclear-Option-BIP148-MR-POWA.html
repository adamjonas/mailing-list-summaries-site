        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>John Hardy, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has warned that the proposal to split the Bitcoin network into two or three blockchains as a way to triple its capacity is highly contentious and risky. He suggests that it could be a game-theory exercise to test theories. Hardy also advises finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use. Hardy's post introduces Mining Reactive Proof of Work Addition (MR POWA) as a method to introduce an additional proof of work to a blockchain in response to detected mining behaviour. The criteria for activation in the case of BIP148 would be when the software detects a non-BIP148 compliant chain that is 144 blocks ahead of a BIP148 compliant chain.MR POWA is a method that introduces an additional proof of work to a blockchain in response to detected mining behavior. In the case of BIP148, the activation criterion could be when non-BIP148 compliant chain is detected 144 blocks ahead of the BIP148 compliant chain. The software would then change its consensus rules (hard fork) to lower the difficulty for existing PoW method and introduce a second POW method such as Scrypt or Ethash. This would guarantee SegWit activation and heap additional pressure on miners to follow the BIP148 chain. The downside is that it could permanently split the network, but the upside is that BIP148 miners would no longer need to “hold their nerve” as they would be guaranteed a viable chain and rewarded for their early support. It could neutralize attacks from the other chain by requiring POW methods to alternate. Hardy’s plan is based on pure game theory and will have to be evaluated carefully before implementation. This idea is highly contentious and should be implemented in a grassroots movement similar to BIP148. Anyone who is already running a BIP148 node could easily run a BIP148 + MR POWA node. Ideally, it would just force the miners to follow the BIP148 chain and the code would never be activated. The proposal to split the Bitcoin network into two or three blockchains as a way to triple its capacity has been a subject of debate, but Hardy suggests that this move might permanently split the network.</p>
