    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 5, 2017, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev wrote that the proposals for gratuitous orphaning are reckless and coercive. He believes that miners should not be incentivized to act honestly since it violates their professional obligation to minimize harm. The changes in Bitcoin's design are necessary to keep the network secure and reduce the risk of harm. However, Maxwell does not appreciate character assassination and argues against these changes.Maxwell opposes the changes strongly, but he has seen no evidence or case for not having a mandatory signal turned out to be a serious bug in BIP 9. Since there is a drastically different opinion on this subject, it may be best to wait until after BIP148 to continue the discussion, thereby having more real-world information to work from.Therefore, a new pull request has been opened with just the parts that Maxwell seems to be objecting to removed. It remains to be seen if this version will be satisfactory.</p>
