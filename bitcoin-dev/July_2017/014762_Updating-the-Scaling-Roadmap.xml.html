    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Tao Effect and CryptAxe via the bitcoin-dev mailing list, they debated the security model of adding consensus rules via softfork in Drivechain. While both agreed that it was a different security model, CryptAxe disagreed that it would encourage more risky behavior. He explained that the risks associated with drivechains were not due to how new consensus rules would be added, but rather were similar to the risk associated with the P2SH softfork. Tao Effect questioned whether full nodes validate the script in P2SH and SegWit, suggesting that miners may not have complete control over coins. However, CryptAxe argued that anyone-can-spend outputs are used by less than 0.1% of users in the present situation and most software doesn't even allow for the possibility. He also noted that new transaction types that depend on softforked consensus rules are exponentially less risky to the point that it is infeasible to steal them as blocks are added to the chain that activated the soft fork. Luke-Jr and Lopp were cited as sources who had done research on the cost of stealing these outputs.</p>
