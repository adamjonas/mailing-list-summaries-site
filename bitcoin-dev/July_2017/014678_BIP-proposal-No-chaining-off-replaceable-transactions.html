    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal of BIP125 is to allow transactions to opt into replaceability to increase the fees of unconfirming transactions, creating a more efficient fee market place. However, this goal is hindered when the receiver of a transaction spends from the unconfirmed output, which forces the sender to choose between paying an effectively unbounded amount of money as per the BIP125 rules or not fee bump at all. This is problematic for batched sends with multiple independent receivers. To support a healthy fee marketplace, this policy proposes a max chain depth of 1 for any BIP125 transactions. As a result, receivers of BIP125 transactions will need to wait until the transaction has confirmed before spending from it. If senders want to make further transactions before the BIP125 transaction confirms, they will need to replace the transaction with one that makes the other send in "pass through" style or first finalize the BIP125 transaction and then chain from the spend normally.</p>
