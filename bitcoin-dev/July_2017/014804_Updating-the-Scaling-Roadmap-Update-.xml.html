    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about adding new, untested ideas to the Bitcoin roadmap, Alex Morcos and Peter Todd agree that caution is necessary. Todd also points out that excitement around new ideas can lead to fixation without proper peer review and testing. To illustrate his point, he uses his own Treechains work as an example of an idea that generated excitement but ultimately proved more difficult to implement than anticipated. He argues that Drivechains is currently in a similar situation and emphasizes that proper security peer review takes a significant amount of time and effort. While he acknowledges the importance of research and development, he urges the community to be conservative and flexible in how it evolves Bitcoin.</p>
