    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Chris Stewart and Paul Sztorc, they discuss the readiness of drivechains for Bitcoin core. Chris suggests that there is still a lot of work to be done and that the optimistic estimate for drivechains to be ready is early 2018. However, he believes that private individuals and businesses may help with parallelizing the remaining work due to incentives for competitiveness, especially in regards to smartphone wallets. Chris also questions the inclusion of a hard fork suggestion in the scaling roadmap, as he believes that if drivechains are successful, they should be viewed as the way to scale, not hard forking the protocol. Paul explains that the roadmap was written to be representative of a Core/developer position, and that he is philosophically against hard forks, but felt it should stay in the document for political reasons. Overall, Paul feels that the old scaling roadmap is too outdated to serve its purpose and proposes revising it.</p>
