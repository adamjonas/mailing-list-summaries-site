    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Hampus and Federico Tenga on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the reasons why some users may not want their node to be SegWit compliant. One reason given was that it could potentially require extra bandwidth, which could be avoided by running a 0.14.2 node that is okay with >1MB blocks in case SegWit is widely used. However, if the majority of the network adopts SegWit, it would be best to validate SegWit transactions to fully verify ownership of bitcoins. Those who are not interested in SegWit transactions may choose to keep the cost of their node lower by running a non-SegWit node. It is unclear how practical this approach will be in the long run, but it makes a case for having an up-to-date non-SegWit node. The email exchange concluded with Gregory Maxwell suggesting alternatives to achieve their goals.</p>
