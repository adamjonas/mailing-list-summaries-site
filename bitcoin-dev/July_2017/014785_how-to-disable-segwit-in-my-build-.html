    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about SegWit compliance continued with a user expressing concern over the extra bandwidth required for SegWit transactions. They suggested that those not interested in SegWit transactions may prefer to keep their node lower-cost by running a non-SegWit node, but if SegWit becomes widely used, it would be in their best interest to validate those transactions. Another user pointed out that if one wishes to avoid receiving UTXOs previously encumbered by a SegWit output, they cannot avoid it any more than they can currently avoid receiving BTC encumbered by a P2SH output. The original poster proposed that continuing with a lower bandwidth cap and keeping their coins "untainted" could be an experiment worth considering.</p>
