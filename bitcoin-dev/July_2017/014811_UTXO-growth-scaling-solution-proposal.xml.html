    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on bitcoin-dev, Major Kusanagi discussed the issue of unbounded UTXO growth, which is unscalable and could prevent bitcoins from lasting forever. However, a proposed solution does not improve scalability and still allows for bitcoins to last forever. The only lost bitcoins would be those whose owners forget or lose their keys, as most people with significant amounts of bitcoins would move them around before they become useless. The estimate mentioned in the post refers to block size rather than UTXO size, which cannot currently be safely pruned.</p>
