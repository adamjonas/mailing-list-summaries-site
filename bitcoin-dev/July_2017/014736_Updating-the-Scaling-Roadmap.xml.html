    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A leading Bitcoin developer has proposed a revision of the cryptocurrency's roadmap. The aim is to remove completed items, introduce new innovations and approaches, and update deadlines and projections. He suggested that the development community needs to agree on timelines for innovations, and he sets out what he believes are reasonable lead times for hard forks. He suggests that it would be helpful to engage with investors and businesses on the issue. He proposes dividing activities into phases, including those already available to users, those awaiting consensus, active development, draft proposals at experimental stage and ideas not yet experimented with. The developer sees 18 months as the bare minimum amount of time for a robustly implemented hard fork, which would place it in early 2019 at the earliest.</p>
