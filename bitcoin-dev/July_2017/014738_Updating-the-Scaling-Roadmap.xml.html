    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tao Effect and Paul from 7/11/2017, Tao Effect stated that there is a difference between replying to an email and addressing the issues that were brought up in it. Tao Effect then gave an example where Paul admitted that miners have the ability to steal bitcoins through sidechains, something they cannot do currently. Paul argued that if users choose to deposit to an anyone-can-spend output, then miners can take the Bitcoins, which they can already do. Tao Effect also disagreed with Paul's equating of three different types of theft. Paul responded by saying that while the three types of theft involve different attacker resources and behaviors, they are not different in that all cases result in the user losing BTC they would have otherwise owned. The email exchange ended with Tao Effect stating that Drivechain is an unmistakeable weakening of Bitcoin's security guarantees, which Paul denied.</p>
