    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, developer Luke Dashjr proposed that BIP8 - the proposal for a user-activated soft fork (UASF) - should be amended to include a height-based threshold alongside its current blocktime-based threshold. Shaolin Fry responded to Dashjr's suggestion, stating that while some have criticized the blocktime-based thresholds in BIP9 as confusing and vulnerable to miners fiddling with timestamps, a height-based threshold would be hard to predict far in advance due to difficulty fluctuations. However, Fry expressed willingness to amend BIP8 to include a height-based threshold if there was sufficient interest, as it would be a simple amendment now that the proposal has been widely reviewed. In response, Dashjr noted that he had previously explored the idea of requiring signalling before activation in an earlier draft of BIP8, but dropped it due to concerns about gratuitous orphaning and the fact that miners can simply fake signal. He also stated that a properly constructed soft fork is generally such that miners have to deliberately do something invalid, rather than being tricked into it. Dashjr had previously opened a pull request to fix issues with BIP9 and merge it with BIP8.</p>
