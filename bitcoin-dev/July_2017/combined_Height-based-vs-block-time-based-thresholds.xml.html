        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There have been discussions among Bitcoin developers regarding proposed changes to BIP 9. The changes aim to address issues with blocktime-based thresholds, but there are differing opinions on whether mandatory signaling is necessary. Some developers, such as Luke Dashjr, argue that not having a mandatory signal is a serious bug in BIP 9. However, others fear that it could lead to monetary losses and network instability resulting from disruption.Shaolinfry has proposed amending BIP 8 to be height-based, which would eliminate confusion over the first retarget after threshold and prevent miners from manipulating timestamps. Despite disagreements, developers continue to explore ways to improve Bitcoin's design, such as amending BIP 8 to include height-based thresholds alongside its current blocktime-based threshold.Some developers have expressed concerns about proposals for gratuitous orphaning, which they believe could violate the professional obligation to do no harm. Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev wrote that the proposals for gratuitous orphaning are reckless and coercive. However, he does not appreciate character assassination and argues against these changes. A new pull request has been opened with just the parts that Maxwell seems to be objecting to removed.In a recent bitcoin-dev discussion, Hampus suggested that BIP 8 be made into its own BIP or allow for more flexibility in the LOCKED_IN state. In response, Luke Dashjr explained that the mandatory signal was not pointless but rather a wake-up call for miners who may be "asleep at the wheel" to upgrade in time.Shaolinfry has already written a height-based reference implementation and updated the BIP text in the "lockinontimeout" proposal. The code and BIP for BIP 8 can be found on Github. If there is sufficient interest, shaolinfry is willing to make the amendment to BIP 8 as it would be a simple change now that the proposal has been widely reviewed.Overall, there are differing opinions on how to address the issues with BIP 9 and whether disruption through orphaning is necessary for advancement or violates professional obligation to do no harm. Despite disagreements, developers continue to explore ways to improve Bitcoin's design.</p>
