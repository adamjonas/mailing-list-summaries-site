    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj and Paul discussed the latter's sidechain scheme which does not refund bribes if a reorganization occurs. Paul explained that his scheme ensures that a sidechain cannot reorganize unless the main chain reorganizes since the consensus loop only cares about matching the current block. ZmnSCPxj then gave an example where a sidechain represented by a jumble of capital letters started to reorg with a competing chain.  They also compared the efficiency of their schemes, with Paul claiming that his is more space-efficient since he only requires one hash to be communicated along with an indicator byte and a ~2 byte counter for the ratchet. ZmnSCPxj asked if Paul provides a single sidechain's h* twice in the block, once in the coinbase and once in the briber's separate transaction. Technically, they do include it twice, but the second instance (briber-transaction) can be "shuffled" out if the counterparties are part of the same Lightning Network. Finally, there were many tangled issues regarding Drivechain, side-to-main withdrawals, individual Drivechains themselves, Blind Merged Mining, and OP BribeVerify. The ratchet is exclusively about Blind Merged Mining, and making a better OP BribeVerify that offers better guarantees to both sides.</p>
