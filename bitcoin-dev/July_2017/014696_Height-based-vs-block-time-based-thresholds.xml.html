    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to orphan blocks in Bitcoin's blockchain has been met with strong opposition. Luke Dashjr had opened a PR to implement the changes, which would also address other issues with BIP 9. However, critics argue that gratuitous orphaning is reckless and coercive, as it violates the professional obligation of causing no harm. It is not anyone's position to decide who needs to be "woken up" with avoidable financial harm. While some argue that disruption may be needed for advancement, others oppose such changes strongly. The issue of having a mandatory signal has also been disputed, with no evidence or case presented to support this claim.</p>
