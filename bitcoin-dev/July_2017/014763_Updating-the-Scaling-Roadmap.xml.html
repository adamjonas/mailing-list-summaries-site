    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Greg questioned whether Pieter's objection to Drivechain was valid on the grounds that it operates with a different security model. He had previously understood that in P2SH and SegWit transactions, full nodes validate the script, meaning miners do not have complete control over the coins. However, if this is not the case, then Greg's argument would be invalid. Another participant in the conversation pointed out that anyone-can-spend outputs are used by less than 0.1% of users, but in Drivechain, they are encouraged by design. The discussion also touched on the wide usage of BIP16, which is supported by most wallets.</p>
