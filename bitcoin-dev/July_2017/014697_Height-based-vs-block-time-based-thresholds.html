    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr proposed changes to BIP8 that seem aimed at addressing the regression compared to BIP9, which has no way to avoid activating a suboptimal or flawed soft fork after deployment without hard forking. However, it is important to consider when this mechanism would be beneficial versus when it could cause harm compared to BIP8 without the mechanism. The scenario that the mechanism was designed for is one in which miners refuse to activate a widely desired upgrade on non-technical grounds, and in that case, the "wakeup call" would be in users' hands. It remains unclear whether there is a hypothetical scenario in which orphan risk outweighs the benefits of such an upgrade mechanism that can be chosen to be optional by default with a deferred mechanism to make it mandatory at deploy-time. A proposal has been made to fix the issues with BIP9; however, there are concerns that proposals involving gratuitous orphaning may be reckless and coercive and violate the professional obligation to do no harm. There is also opposition to making a mandatory signal due to fears of monetary losses and network instability resulting from the resulting disruption.</p>
