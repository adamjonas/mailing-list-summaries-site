    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the message has been intentionally running Bitcoin releases prior to 0.13.1 in order to avoid the possibility of the segwit activation. However, they are now interested in implementing some of the more recent features without activating segwit until they choose to do so. The writer is curious about what code change(s) need to be made to disable the activation of segwit in the 0.14.2+ code, while keeping their node acting like a legacy node with respect to consensus rules. They pose a general question as to how to disable any Bip9 versionbits feature. The writer is not looking for reasons not to do it, but rather how to do it without any unwanted side-effects. Their first idea is to simply change the segwit nTimeout in chainparams.cpp to a date in the past, but they want advice from experts before making any changes. In full disclosure, the writer states that they may be the only one who wants this, but if successful, they plan to release their changes in case someone else wishes to run with status-quo consensus rules.</p>
