    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been updated. The technical specification has been improved, with the block size increase now specified in terms of weight rather than bytes. Additionally, the increase in the maximum block sigops after the hard fork has been documented, and comments have been added about the worst case block size. In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there was discussion about the responsibility of implementing a hard fork before sufficient testing has been conducted. While one member claimed that code to support 2x had been tested for over a year, another member argued that this was not true and that the current code had not been properly tested yet. The email also reminded readers to start signaling something before block 475776.</p>
