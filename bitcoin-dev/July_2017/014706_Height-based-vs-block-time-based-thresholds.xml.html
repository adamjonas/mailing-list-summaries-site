    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In response to criticism of BIP9's blocktime-based thresholds, shaolinfry has proposed a modification to make them height-based. The change would eliminate confusion over the first retarget after threshold and prevent miners from manipulating timestamps to delay activation. Although there is uncertainty over the exact date of a height-based threshold due to difficulty fluctuations, there is certainty at a given block height, which is easy to monitor. Shaolinfry has already written a height-based reference implementation and updated the BIP text in the "lockinontimeout" proposal. With the change to height-based thresholds, the "lockinontimeout" implementation detail can be dispensed with entirely. The two changes that BIP8 brings are BIP9 modified to use height instead of time and removal of the veto failed state. The code and BIP for BIP8 can be found on Github.</p>
