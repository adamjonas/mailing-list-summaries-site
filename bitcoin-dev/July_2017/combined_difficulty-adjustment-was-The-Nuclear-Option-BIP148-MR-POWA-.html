        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There has been a proposal to split the Bitcoin network into two or three different blockchains to triple its capacity. However, this idea is highly controversial as it could lead to a permanent split in the network and put additional pressure on miners to follow a specific chain for a minimally disruptive upgrade. The MR POWA (Mining Reactive Proof of Work Addition) method has been suggested to introduce an additional proof of work to a blockchain in response to detected mining behavior.In the case of BIP148, the activation criteria for MR POWA would be when the software detects a non-BIP148 compliant chain that is 144 blocks ahead of a BIP148 compliant chain. Each method would have its own difficulty, and it could be a requirement that POW methods alternate to neutralize attacks from the other chain. This would ensure SegWit activation.Henning Kopp suggests that forks grow with the same block frequency as the main chain, which implies that the longest chain rule becomes irrelevant since all chains will have the same length. The chain with the most work would be considered the true one. Finally, Kopp advises finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use.</p>
