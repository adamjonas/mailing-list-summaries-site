    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and Paul Sztorc, they discussed the possibility of a document gaining traction on BitcoinCore.org. Paul expressed that without interest from the maintainers of bitcoincore.org, the document will probably be unable to gain traction. David responded by stating that the BitcoinCore.org maintainers are not psychic and if Paul wants his document to appear on the website, he should open a PR. David also offered to help format the document for the website. David mentioned that while the community of Core Contributors ultimately decides in a philosophical sense, it is up to the maintainers of BitcoinCore.org in a practical sense as they are the ones who ultimately decide if the standard has been met. He also suggested that site-updates should be narrowly organized in the GitHub PR sphere and to ignore everything else.Paul appreciated David's response and stated that he would make opening a PR to BitcoinCore.org with David's statement a priority so that future confusion can be avoided. In response, David apologized for not posting a copy of Maxwell's reply on BitcoinCore.org and wasting Paul's time because of it. David also included an email from Gregory Maxwell where he praised Paul's reply and suggested finding a place on the website to post something like it so that it can be linked to when other people ask for roadmaps and other commitments to future plans.</p>
