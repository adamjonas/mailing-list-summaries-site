    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Greg is conflating two different usages of the word "theft": whether the soft fork rules have been followed and whether the WT^ submitted by a majority hashrate matches the one calculated by sidechain nodes. Despite committing to discussing theft_2, Greg switches back to theft_1 when he talks about a "P2SH script...used for the purpose of facilitating theft". Under theft_2, there is no way to infer the theft-ness of the transaction from the script itself. Moving from pre-P2SH to post-P2SH has not yet enabled any theft_2 as a result. However, P2SH has failed to enable sidechains. The SPV proofs in DC are essential, as they allow nodes to enforce the delayed withdrawal upon miners. Experts believe that this delayed withdrawal technique is likely to mitigate the threat of theft_2.</p>
