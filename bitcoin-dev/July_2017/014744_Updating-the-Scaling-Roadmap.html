    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Paul Sztorc requested that a person share their objections to drivechain's security model, which they had previously declined to do. The person responded by saying that while they didn't think the criticisms were relevant to the current thread, they had spoken to several people about it and would have advised against certain aspects of the proposal if consulted. They also expressed concern about the use of roadmaps as communication tools and suggested privately polling major actors to find out what they would add or remove before taking the intersection to spare everyone unnecessary debate. They emphasized that their comments were unsolicited advice and that no one owed anyone a response.</p>
