    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has opened a pull request (PR) to fix some issues with BIP 9, which has been open for almost two weeks. The PR requires the approval of another developer to merge. On July 5, 2017, shaolinfry via bitcoin-dev pointed out criticisms of BIP 9's blocktime based thresholds. These criticisms included confusion and vulnerability to miners fiddling with timestamps, which could prevent or delay activation. Shaolinfry suggested that amending BIP 8 to be height-based would address these issues. Although height-based thresholds are hard to predict due to difficulty fluctuations, there is certainty at a given block height and it's easy to monitor. If there is sufficient interest, shaolinfry would be happy to make this amendment. The omission of height-based thresholds in the interests of simplicity of review was originally made by shaolinfry, but since the proposal has been widely reviewed, making the change would be a trivial amendment. The PR remains open for approval.</p>
