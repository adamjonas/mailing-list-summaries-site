    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list discussion on bitcoin-dev, Dan Libby expressed confusion over the validation of segwit inputs in his node. He noted that his node would accept incoming tx inputs but wouldn't perform any segwit related validation, thus leaving those inputs unvalidated. He further stated that he didn't understand how his node thought they were valid at all given that it didn't recognize P2WPKH address format. In response to this, Lucas Clemente Vella clarified that from Dan's perspective, the P2WPKH would look like an anyone-can-spend transaction and, therefore, valid no matter who is spending. This means that Dan would essentially be leaving the security of segwit transactions to those who are interested in and using them. If Dan's fork became popular, it would decrease the security of Segwit transactions to something akin to the security model of the Drivechain currently being discussed, where only those particularly interested in that particular sidechain (and segwit witness could be loosely categorized into a sidechain) will be responsible for preventing others from stealing funds from the anyone-can-spend transactions.</p>
