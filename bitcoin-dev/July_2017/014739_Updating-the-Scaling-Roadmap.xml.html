    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Paul Sztorc, Maxwell expressed doubts about the accuracy of the roadmap recently released by Sztorc. Specifically, Maxwell questioned if Sztorc had consulted with enough developers in the creation of the roadmap and stated that he felt Sztorc's only objection was that he hadn't been consulted personally. While Sztorc admitted to being personally against hard forks, he included them in the roadmap as they were a part of the previous version. Maxwell countered that the project is not philosophically against hardforks, at least not in an absolute sense, but that opinions on the matter are complicated. The two agreed that there is much confusion around the issue of hardforks in general.</p>
