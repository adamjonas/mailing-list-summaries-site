    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Greg Slepak challenges Paul Sztorc's response to his previous email regarding the security issues of Drivechain. Slepak accuses Sztorc of not addressing any of the issues he raised and instead trying to equate three different types of theft, which Slepak argues is a way of admitting to the issues without actually addressing them. Slepak claims that Drivechain weakens Bitcoin's security guarantees and that there are better options being worked on. Sztorc responds by directing Slepak to his previous email where he had responded to Slepak's concerns at length. He also disputes Slepak's claim that adopting Drivechain would be an irreversible course of action, stating that it could be easily reversed with a second soft fork. However, Sztorc suggests that continuing to discuss Drivechain could veer off-topic and advises against it.</p>
