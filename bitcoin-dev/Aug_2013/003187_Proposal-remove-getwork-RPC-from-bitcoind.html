    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 19, 2013, Dr. Brian Goss suggested the idea of a function that could salvage a non-functioning network in the event of a massive drop in hash rate. He also pondered how to recover from a great depression in network hash rate or someone spending $100 million just to drive up the difficulty and then turning off their hardware. The discussion then shifted to the hashrate of desktop CPUs and how they wouldn't make much of a dent in it due to the slow integrated CPU miner. A suggestion was made to package a modern mining tool that supports CPU/GPU/FPGA/ASIC mining against a current bitcoind. This would reduce the difference between testnet and mainnet and provide a useful tool for contributing directly. However, it was noted that Jeff's patch didn't remove the integrated miner, which some believed it should have. Instead, it only removed the getwork support for external miners who don't use getblocktemplate. It was suggested that if one were to download one of those miners, they could go download bfgminer instead.</p>
