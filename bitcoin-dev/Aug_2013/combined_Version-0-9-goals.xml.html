        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2013, members of the Bitcoin community were discussing various improvements to the cryptocurrency. Wladimir agreed that payment protocol, autotools and Qt5 build were important while expressing hesitation about coin control, citing an issue with statefulness introduced into the wallet model. Pieter responded that the state had been passed in a separate object to the transaction-creation methods and expressed support for coin control as a way to differentiate between the high-level abstraction (wallet) and the underlying implementation (individual coins). He also suggested multiwallet as a way to avoid linkage between identities, but noted that there was little progress on that front.In the same thread, Mike Hearn expressed excitement about headers-first cut sync time and noted that Pieter reported a 45-minute sync time on a hexacore Xeon CPU with several GB of -dbcache, libsecp256k1 for verification, and a good network connection. He provided a link to the code on GitHub and stated that it was usable and stable, but needed some cleaning up before pull request submission. Mike also discussed plans to ship payment protocol support in at least two clients simultaneously and ideally with a big merchant signed up too, to send a powerful message that the community meant business. Jeff from BitPay expressed interest in being a leader in support for the protocol and coordination efforts were made to get multiple clients and merchants to start supporting it in a short timeframe.</p>
