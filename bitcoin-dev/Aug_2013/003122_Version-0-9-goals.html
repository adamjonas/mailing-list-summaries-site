    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 15, 2013, Gavin Andresen sent an email discussing the upcoming release of Bitcoin version 0.9. He mentioned that Payment Protocol support was ready to be pulled from GitHub and added to the release. The feature had gone through two rounds of bounty-driven QA testing and was deemed ready for merging unless there were any major objections. There were no objections from Wladimir who had already looked at the code and tested it. Gavin also expressed his desire to include sipa's "headers first" initial block download optimization in the release, which would require a longer 0.9 test and release cycle. He then listed a few other features he wanted to see included in the final 0.9 release, such as coin control, autotools work, and Gitian-build with the latest openssl and Qt5. Wladimir agreed with the inclusion of Payment Protocol, autotools, and Qt5 build, but expressed reservations about coin control due to its introduction of statefulness into the wallet model, which could cause issues with concurrency. However, he said that it was fine with him as long as the issues were resolved since many people seemed to want it.</p>
