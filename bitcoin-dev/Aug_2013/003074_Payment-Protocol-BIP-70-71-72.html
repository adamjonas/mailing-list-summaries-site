    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Mike Hearn and Pieter, the topic of 'locked inputs' in wallet applications is discussed. Hearn expresses concerns about wallet functionality without supporting the P2P protocol, which could simplify implementation for simple hardware-based wallets. He also raises the issue of ensuring that the responsibility of confirming transactions lies with the receiver while making sure that creating a confirmable transaction rests with the sender. To minimize cases where a transaction is accidentally broadcast without the receiver being informed, there should be a way to give a bitcoin URI (or a URL to a payment descriptor) that does not contain a static Bitcoin address. Hearn fears scenarios where an evil hotspot owner observes a payment request and constructs a payment message himself with the request and transaction, adding his own refund address or delivery location. To fix this problem, transactions must commit to the payment message instead of vice versa.</p>
