    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Currently, Bitcoin does not use post-quantum schemes due to their poor space/bandwidth usage properties. However, post-QC schemes based on Regev's LWE assumption are becoming more competitive with traditional schemes. A 2010 paper showed that these schemes were able to reach similar levels as large RSA key sizes (2048 bits), although still worse than ECC. The improvement in technology also suggests that by the time QC becomes a real problem, we could have devices with gigabit wifi, 32 cores and terabytes of storage.</p>
