    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 16, 2013, Luke-Jr reported on a pull request that had merged the master branch on an unofficial Ripple fork of LevelDB rather than updating to LevelDB 1.12.0. While Vinnie had somewhat disclosed this, it was not fully understood by others. The "Ripple and Bitcoin fork" was believed to be just LevelDB with changes already made, but there appeared to be other changes included in what was finally merged. Furthermore, Ripple's fork did not do a proper git merge of upstream, creating a break in git history, and several upstream fixes were not included in the merge. As a result, Luke-Jr pushed three branches to <a href="https://github.com/luke-jr/leveldb:">https://github.com/luke-jr/leveldb:</a> bitcoin-1.5, bitcoin, and bitcoin-up. A diff from current master (Ripple LevelDB 1.12 fork) to bitcoin-up can be found at <a href="https://gist.github.com/luke-jr/6248543">https://gist.github.com/luke-jr/6248543</a>. Peter Todd responded to the issue, noting that he had run into a similar problem while auditing Litecoin. He stated that tools to audit whether a set of git patches/merges matched upstream or downstream don't exist yet. Although manually checking individual files could work, automating the process would be helpful.</p>
