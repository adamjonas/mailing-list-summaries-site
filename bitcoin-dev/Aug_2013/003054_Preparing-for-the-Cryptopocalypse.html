    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, a great presentation about advances in crypto has been shared on SlideShare. The presentation covers various aspects of cryptography, including the history and evolution of cryptography, modern cryptographic techniques, and their applications in the current digital landscape. The slides are available at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/astamos/bh-slides.The">http://www.slideshare.net/astamos/bh-slides.The</a> presentation begins with an introduction to cryptography and its importance in securing digital communication. It then delves into the history of cryptography, starting from ancient times when it was used for secret messaging, to the modern era where it plays a crucial role in securing online transactions and communication.The speaker explains the difference between symmetric and asymmetric key encryption and how they work. He also discusses the concept of hashing and its use in ensuring data integrity. In addition, the presentation covers various modern cryptographic techniques such as elliptic curve cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and post-quantum cryptography.The second half of the presentation is dedicated to the practical applications of cryptography in today's digital world. It covers topics such as secure email communication, secure messaging, secure file sharing, and secure online payments. The speaker provides examples of popular tools and protocols used for these purposes, such as PGP, OTR, Tor, and Bitcoin.Overall, the presentation provides a comprehensive overview of cryptography, its history, and its practical applications. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the field of cryptography and its importance in securing digital communication.</p>
