        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2013, Mike Hearn discussed the potential of using Mozilla Persona as an infrastructure for web-based single sign-on. Persona is a decentralized authentication system that works by having email providers sign temporary certificates for their users, whose browsers then sign server-provided challenges to prove their email address. The goal is for Persona to become transparently decentralized over time, but currently relies on trusted third parties and centralized servers.Hearn believes that using Persona to sign payments would be beneficial due to its convenience compared to certificate authorities (CAs). It offers a smart and professional user experience and uses a custom JSON-based assertion signed by RSA keys, which makes implementation easy. However, Wendell suggests exploring blockchain-based SSO implementations. Despite some limitations and concerns, leveraging Persona would offer convenience for users and a smart and professional user experience. Persona runs various fallback services that allow anyone with an email address to take part and also integrates with Google/Yahoo SSO systems until it becomes decentralized. Nevertheless, Persona increases reliance on trusted third parties since keys and passwords are stored on Mozilla's servers or email providers. Hearn notes that users can run their own IDP on a personal server to avoid involvement with Mozilla's servers. He acknowledges that convenience often comes at the expense of security, but believes that Persona's ease of use is a significant advantage for casual apps with non-sensitive information.In contrast, Bitcoin aims to reduce dependence on trusted third parties. While X.509 can issue a cert to any address, including a bitcoin address, most enterprises, including Mozilla, think that key management on the client is beyond the average user. Nonetheless, the web payments and payswarm communities have done a lot of work on signing stuff with RSA (or other) keys, including implementations that may be reusable.A (client or server-side) X.509 cert can be issued to any address, including a bitcoin address, allowing the private key to sit on the client and the public key to be discoverable by the other end. However, most enterprises, including Mozilla, take the stance that key management on the client is beyond the average user. For those interested in signing stuff with RSA (or other) keys, the web payments and payswarm communities have done a lot of work on this, including implementations that may be reusable.Despite being easier to use, Persona is not more or less centralized than other PKIs. Ultimately, the user at host pair string requires centralization via DNS, and SSL must connect to it to verify assertions, meaning that the regular SSL PKI is still present under the hood.</p>
