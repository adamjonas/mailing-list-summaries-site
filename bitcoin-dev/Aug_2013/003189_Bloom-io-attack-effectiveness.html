    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on August 19, 2013, John Dillon expressed his support for decentralization and questioned Gavin's target of 10,000 full nodes, believing it to be too few for a distributed system. He also brought up the idea of partial UTXO sets, wondering if they were being ignored and urging for a separate thread to discuss the topic. In response, Wendell agreed with John's points and asked for any GitHub links related to the subject. John then criticized Gavin's priorities, specifically the payment protocol's lack of options beyond SSL certified merchants and the absence of a safe way to get money into wallets. He also mentioned his own pull request for decentralization and asked which way Gavin planned on voting.</p>
