    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd in 2013, they discuss the importance of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) peers to the growth of Bitcoin. Peter argues that SPV peers are more important than nodes, as tens of millions of lightweight devices rely on them. He suggests that SPV peers should be allowed to donate back to the network with spare bandwidth to achieve decentralization. Peter also proposes partial UTXO set ideas, which Gavin ignores. Gavin is criticized for his priorities regarding the payment protocol, which includes no notion of paying anyone other than an SSL certified merchant. The exchange ends with a question about how Gavin plans to vote on Peter's decentralization pull request.</p>
