    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas, one of the things you were reviewing was the integration work to integrate the Payment Protocol into your products. However, you're wondering if there is any notion of a standardized invoice serialization. If you pay for two burgers and one Club Mate, how would your Bitcoin Wallet be able to know that? Presently, you would simply put that into "memo" and come up with your own serialization mechanism.Additionally, you are interested in knowing if there is a way to communicate acceptance levels of TX (unconfirmed, 1 conf, 6 conf) by using several PaymentACK.</p>
