    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Namecoin blockchain has an id/ and a/ (alias) namespace which is used to store bitcoin addresses, bitmessage IDs and other data. The purpose of this is to allow people to use human-readable names rather than long alphanumeric strings to represent their wallet public key address. This idea was raised by Chris Evans in 2013 who suggested that a person could use English name to describe a wallet public key address, and the software could use it to look up the wallet ID. However, Rick Wesson noted that there would be no support for DNS as a mapping tool for names to numbers. The Namecoin blockchain's id/ and a/ namespace has been spam squatted by several actors recently. Several bitmessage IDs are stored here along with Bitcoin addresses. The purpose of Namecoin is to provide secure identity management, domain name registration, and decentralized data storage, all using a blockchain. It is also designed to be a merge-mined sidechain of Bitcoin, meaning that miners can mine both chains at the same time without any extra effort. Version control is standard for application code, but databases haven't caught up. So steps can be taken to put SQL databases under version control.</p>
