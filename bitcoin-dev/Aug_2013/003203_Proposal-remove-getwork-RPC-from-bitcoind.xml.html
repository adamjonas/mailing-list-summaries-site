    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this email thread is centered around the impact of removing "getwork" from the client on the "setgenerate" RPC call. The concern is whether generating coins on testnet-in-a-box would still be possible without a dedicated miner. Testnet-in-a-box is considered very useful for testing and easy to set up, so the hope is that it will remain functional. One person mentions that all the desktop CPUs in the world wouldn't make a significant impact on the hashrate and suggests using USB sticks, which can be pushed to around 500MH/s. Overall, the discussion revolves around the practical implications of the proposed change and how it could affect the functionality of testnet-in-a-box. There are also some suggestions for alternative methods of mining that could be used instead of desktop CPUs. The email ends with a link to Performance Central, a site for resources related to efficient Application Performance Management.</p>
