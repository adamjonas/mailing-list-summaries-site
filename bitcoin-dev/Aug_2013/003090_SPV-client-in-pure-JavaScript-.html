    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about creating a wallet application that would be usable on the web. While it's possible to use JavaScript for this purpose, building a wallet in a web app presents challenges because web apps aren't allowed to make raw TCP socket connections. One potential solution is using browser-specific features like extensions or "installable apps" to give code greater access permissions. Chrome has a "Native Client" plug-in that could be used for an SPV implementation, but this goes off-topic from the original subject. The challenge with using Chrome as an app platform instead of a JVM is that users who don't have Chrome installed may not want to install it solely to run a wallet app. The author also expresses concerns about using JavaScript outside of the browser, which would result in lower safety, performance, and fewer features compared to other languages and platforms designed for building apps.</p>
