    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests that payment URIs may replace Bitcoin URI as it solves everything cleaner and easier. The author argues that payments generalize destinations to arbitrary scripts, messages are handled inline, amounts are defined inline which makes it difficult to combine them. To ensure the payment infrastructure works properly, it is not recommended to use old-style static addresses in the URI. A comment was made by Roy Badami regarding BIP 72, where he wonders if there should be some discussion included in the specification as to how the BIP 21 amount, message, and label parameters should be processed when the payment protocol is used. He questions whether the total amount requested by the PaymentRequest required to match the amount parameter when present or whether the client is permitted to complain if they don't. Additionally, he mentions that it is probably worthy of mention to include 'SHOULDs' and 'MAYs' rather than 'MUSTs'.</p>
