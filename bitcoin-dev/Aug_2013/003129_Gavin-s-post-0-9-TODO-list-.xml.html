    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 16, 2013, Gavin Andresen mentioned in a Bitcoin-development mailing list that he was working on three non-0.9 code projects. The first project involved smarter fee handling on the client side. He generated scatter-plots and histograms of transaction fees versus priorities to gain insight into miner policies. The second project was relaying and alerting for "first double-spend" transactions, which would improve low-value in-person transactions. This project was related to an article about using bitcoins to buy snacks. Lastly, Andresen planned to work on two or three whitepapers explaining why the 1MB block size limit needed to be increased or removed, how it could be done safely, and why arguments against it were wrong. In response to this, someone asked what block size Andresen thought was ideal.</p>
