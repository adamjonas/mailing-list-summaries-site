    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 8, 2013, Gavin Andresen updated the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 72 specification to make the bitcoin address optional. If the "request" parameter is provided and backward compatibility is not required, then the bitcoin address portion of the URI may be omitted. However, Pieter still urges some effort to avoid losing metadata and reducing the responsibilities of the sender. He suggests that if a payment_uri is specified, and it cannot be contacted at all, the transaction should fail to prevent unnecessary payments happening without metadata when the payment server cannot be contacted for some reason. Pieter also believes that the receiver needs a peer-to-peer (P2P) implementation and probably a strongly validating one to verify incoming transactions. Therefore, having him broadcast it shouldn't be hard. He does not think the client should be required to stay online to broadcast after a paymentACK is received since the transaction arrived safely at that point.</p>
