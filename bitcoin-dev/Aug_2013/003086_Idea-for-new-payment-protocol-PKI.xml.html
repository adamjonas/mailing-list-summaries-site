    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mozilla Persona is an infrastructure for web-based single sign-on that works by having email providers sign temporary certificates for their users. It allows anyone with an email address to take part in the system and integrates with Google/Yahoo SSO systems until it becomes decentralized. Although it does not use X.509, it uses a custom JSON-based assertion signed by RSA keys, which makes implementation easy. Using Persona to sign payments would be convenient as it provides a smart and professional user experience, unlike CAs designed for website admins. A wallet app would embed a browser and drive it to sign in to Persona, and then sign payment requests automatically. For many users, it would be just one click.</p>
