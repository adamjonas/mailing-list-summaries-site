    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and slush in 2013, the two discussed the possibility of adding payment protocol support to Trezor, a hardware wallet. Slush stated that supporting payment protocol would be important for absolute security of hardware wallets. Mike confirmed that this had always been the plan and asked if it would be a feature in the v1 firmware or added later via firmware update. The plan was to add support for payment protocol into the v1 firmware, but it depended on the readiness of the surrounding infrastructure, specifically if there would be support for payment protocol in Multibit at the time of v1 release. Slush believed that Multibit would be the first wallet compatible with Trezor and also supporting payment protocol.</p>
