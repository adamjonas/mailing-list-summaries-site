    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from August 2013, Mike Hearn discussed the use of Persona, a decentralized authentication system developed by Mozilla. He notes that while Bitcoin aims to reduce dependence on trusted third parties, Persona actually increases reliance on them, since keys and passwords are stored on Mozilla's servers or email providers. However, he believes that Persona has the potential to improve its security and decentralization over time. Hearn also suggests that users can run their own IDP on a personal server to avoid involvement with Mozilla's servers. Responding to concerns about DNS reliance, Hearn points out that DNS is centralised, but has held up well so far. He also notes that Mozilla has a master key to most email accounts, which could be problematic if accessed by someone with malicious intent. Despite these issues, Hearn views Persona as a convenient option for casual apps with non-sensitive information. While he acknowledges that convenience often comes at the expense of security, he believes that Persona's ease of use is a significant advantage.</p>
