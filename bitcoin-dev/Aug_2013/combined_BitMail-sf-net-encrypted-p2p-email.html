        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 13, 2013, in a message on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, The Doctor mistakenly mixed up BitMail with BitMessage. BitMail is a distinct software and can be found at <a href="http://bitmail.sf.net">http://bitmail.sf.net</a>. The Doctor's PGP key is 0x807B17C1 / 7960 1CDC 85C9 0B63 8D9F DD89 3BD8 FF2B 807B 17C1, and his website is <a href="https://drwho.virtadpt.net/">https://drwho.virtadpt.net/</a>. The Doctor's message was GPG signed using version 2.0.20 of GnuPG for verification.During this email thread, another member corrected the mistaken reference to BitMail and provided a link to BitMail's website, which offers secure encrypted peer-to-peer email services. The member also mentioned that there were security analyses available for BitMessage in various forums, but they had not been reviewed due to limited compute cycles. The signature of the message contained links to Project Byzantium, a developer project, and The Doctor's personal website. Additionally, the email included an advertisement for AppDynamics Lite, a troubleshooting tool for Java and .NET code.In a message dated August 9, 2013, Randolph D. asked if anyone had tested the secure encrypted peer-to-peer email service found at <a href="http://bitmail.sf.net">http://bitmail.sf.net</a>. The Doctor, who is the developer of Project Byzantium, responded stating that they have not tested it recently due to its CPU and network intensity, which could potentially harm the user's needs. They recommended reading the security analyses of BitMessage but admitted that they hadn't had the time to review them yet. The security analyses can be found at <a href="https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?topic=1666.0">https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?topic=1666.0</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1fwyx7/a_security_analysis_of_bitmessage/">http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1fwyx7/a_security_analysis_of_bitmessage/</a>. The Doctor signed off with their PGP key and a link to their website.In a brief message, someone named Wendell pleaded with Jesus to stop something. The message was posted on grabhive.com and linked to a Twitter account and a GPG key.Lastly, Bitmail is a secure encrypted peer-to-peer email service that has been tested by users. It can be accessed through <a href="http://bitmail.sf.net">http://bitmail.sf.net</a>. The SVN link for Spot-On-Code, which is related to Bitmail, can be found at svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/spot-on/code/ spot-on-code. Additionally, the commit browser for Spot-On-Code can be viewed at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/spot-on/code/commit_browser">http://sourceforge.net/p/spot-on/code/commit_browser</a>.</p>
