        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion surrounds the removal of "getwork" RPC from bitcoind. Jeff Garzik proposed removing the API because it is no longer widely used, and almost everybody uses a pool to mine on the mainnet. Additionally, attempts to solo mine on mainnet via getwork lead to delays and problems. Despite this, some object to its removal since it is the only mechanism that allows anyone to say that bitcoin is P2P in the truest sense of the word. However, there is a successor API called "getblocktemplate," which is more decentralization-friendly than "getwork." It allows the caller to see what transactions the daemon is trying to put into a block, and even modify it.Gregory Maxwell suggested getting rid of the internal miner too, as it is mostly a pretext for integrated mining, and only works well on testnet but not on the actual production software. He suggests packaging up a GBT miner, which would be usable on the mainnet. Matt also sees no reason to leave broken things in that aren't necessary and no one has the developer resources to fix. Meanwhile, Frank F objects to the removal of getwork, arguing that it denies the individual novice the ability to mine at a small scale, even if it may be inefficient now. However, others argue that technical problems with getwork have been addressed and fixed in getblocktemplate. Doing so would reduce the difference between testnet and mainnet, and provide an actually useful tool for contributing directly.</p>
