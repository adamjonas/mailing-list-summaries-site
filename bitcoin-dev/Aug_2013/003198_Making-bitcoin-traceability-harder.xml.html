    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers are struggling with a shortage of testers and full-time contributors, resulting in delays in implementing new functionality. Instead of focusing on adding new features, the development team is asking for help in testing existing features. Addressing a specific user's suggestion, the developers noted that addresses should only be used once to ensure privacy and reduce the ability to trace transactions. Though ideas such as using power-of-two amounts for transactions were appreciated, they may not necessarily improve privacy. The use of unique payment addresses for each transaction is already considered best practice, but there is room for improvement in Bitcoin-Qt's "Receive coins" tab to discourage address reuse. The idea of merchants using multiple addresses/coins for a single payment could be discussed as a possible privacy extension, but it is not considered an urgent issue.</p>
