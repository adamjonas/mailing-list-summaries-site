        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In July 2013, a discussion was held on Bitcoin development mailing list regarding minor scripting language additions to implement merklized abstract syntax tree (MAST) support. Peter Todd proposed a version where scriptPubKey's can be reused by verifying that path. He also mentioned the disadvantage of large storage requirements for wallets. In response, another user suggested that the size of the table deriving which H(nonce) is selected for a given txid:vout can be significantly smaller and nested IF statements can be replaced by creating the merkle tree over the tuples [i,H(nonce_i)] and proving that the nonce_i provided matched the precommitted tree.Peter Todd discussed the need for careful handling of incoming funds in a multi-party wallet to prevent attackers from fooling users into giving the wrong address. He suggests that funds sent to the wallet should be split up into discrete authorization amounts by all parties involved in authorizing outgoing payments. Gavin Andresen proposed a new design for a wallet that uses two-factor authentication via one-time-passwords with a third-party service to counter-sign 2-of-2 protected wallets. However, involving a third-party can lead to privacy and availability risks. An alternate design utilizes one-time-passwords and removes the requirement for a third-party along with other advantages and disadvantages.The user has a wallet with separate balances for savings and day-to-day spending. Transactions from day-to-day balance do not require authorization, but spending the savings balance does need one-time-passwords. When the day-to-day balance becomes low, the user can authorize the movement of discrete multiples of some amount from savings to spending using one one-time-password per multiple being moved. Savings use P2SH outputs matching HASH160 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG spent with pubkey/seckey generated deterministically using a counter-based one-time-password scheme. Nonces are generated deterministically using RFC2289. The security level is the number of bits for the nonce; 64 bits are sufficient. The author describes a new implementation of P2SH outputs that allows for scriptPubKeys to be reused. The implementation involves a merklized abstract syntax tree (MAST) and the use of short 6-word strings as authorization for payment. A disadvantage is the large storage requirements for the wallets. However, both tables can be stored in a distributed hash table in the cloud without loss of security. The security level is still 2^64, making it difficult for attackers to find a 64-bit pre-image.</p>
