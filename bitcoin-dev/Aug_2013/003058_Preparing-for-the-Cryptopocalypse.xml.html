    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the comparison of ECDLP and RSA/factoring problems in light of quantum computing. The person doubts the conclusion that ECDLP is more robust than RSA/factoring and suggests that switching to ECC in case of a factoring breakthrough may not be a wise decision. The relationship between the two problems is said to be the same from the perspective of quantum computers, but it is unclear whether this relationship holds outside the realm of QCs. The superiority of ECDLP over RSA/factoring is asserted by a presenter who is not a mathematician or cryptographer, but the person is not convinced. NTRU, which is lattice-based and one of the few NIST-recommended QC-resistant algorithms, is discussed as an option for layering on Bitcoin from a crypto standpoint. However, the NTRUsign algorithm to produce signatures was broken last year, and lamport signatures are suggested as alternatives if they are ever broken.</p>
