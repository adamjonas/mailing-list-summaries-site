    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange in August 2013, Bitcoin developer Luke-Jr explained that while there are many good ideas to improve Bitcoin, there is a shortage of developers and testers to implement them. He suggests that people can help by testing already-written features rather than adding new ones. Addressing the issue of privacy, he says using only single-use addresses is best practice, and keeping change amounts as powers of two would hurt privacy and potentially upset users. He suggests transaction fees could be paid separately by small-bucket transactions. While it is already recommended to use a unique payment address for each transaction, Luke-Jr acknowledges that merchants might consider using multiple addresses/coins as a privacy extension. However, he notes that it may not be urgent enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
