    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2013, a discussion took place regarding technical problems with getwork in bitcoin(d|-qt). The consensus was that the issues had been addressed and fixed with the introduction of a replacement called "getblocktemplate." While some were hesitant to remove the ability to mine in the stock package, it was acknowledged that we already don't have it for the mainnet. It was suggested that getwork should be removed but replaced with a proper getblocktemplate miner to ensure that a full network node is provided. The choice of miner was deemed easy as only Luke's bfgminer stuff can mine directly against bitcoin getblocktemplate with no pool in the middle. Additionally, it supports a huge variety of hardware and a superset of target platforms. Overall, the decision was to remove getwork and replace it with a proper getblocktemplate miner to ensure that a full network node is provided.</p>
