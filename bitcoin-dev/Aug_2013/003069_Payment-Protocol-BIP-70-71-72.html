    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, E willbefull expressed the belief that PaymentRequest-only bitcoin URIs could become more common in the future. This would allow for more flexibility in how transactions are processed, as certain types of payments may not make sense to have a single fallback address. Additionally, some pages with bitcoin URI links may rely on separate service providers to assemble the transaction.There may also be a desire to minimize the length of URLs used in QR codes, and some applications might require certain features of the payment protocol. For example, it may be necessary for a print-media QR code to have a cut-off date, or a vendor may require payments to include a refund address.While there are pros and cons to this approach, some argue that the benefits of allowing application designers to innovate outweigh the need for enforced backward compatibility. Overall, the discussion suggests that there is ongoing debate within the Bitcoin community over how best to balance innovation with backward compatibility.</p>
