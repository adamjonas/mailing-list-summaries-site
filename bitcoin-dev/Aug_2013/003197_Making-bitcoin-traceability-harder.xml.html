    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A letter to bitcoin developers suggests that trading arbitrary amounts of bitcoins makes it easier to trace who does what, making tracking harder by enforcing discipline that only keeps a power-of-two amount of satoshis in use-once wallets except for public donation addresses. Although the particular discipline may not be the best to implement, some discipline should be enforced to make tracing harder. Merchants would generate a series of new addresses at each transaction, and customers would send appropriately sized buckets of satoshis to each address. A standard way to specify an amount and a list of addresses as a target for payment should be established, but it might require higher resolution QR codes. It is suggested that this idea has already been considered before, but it's unclear if it was accepted or rejected.</p>
