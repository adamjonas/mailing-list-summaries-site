    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, Bitcoin Core merged a simplification to the consensus rules surrounding deployment of BIPs 34, 66, and 65. This change was based on the assumption that large forks indicate a catastrophic failure, which sets a horrible precedent. The process followed was extremely poor, as the change was already shipped before any discussion took place. Moreover, the checks are avoidable once activated until a sufficiently deep reorg deactivates them, which means that it was not even a material performance optimization. The draft for the full change can be found in the link provided.</p>
