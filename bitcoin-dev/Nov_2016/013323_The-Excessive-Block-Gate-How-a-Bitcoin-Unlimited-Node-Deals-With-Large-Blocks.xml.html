    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner expressed concern over the idea of unlimited block size in Bitcoin. However, according to Tom Zander's response, there would be no change to the concept of proof-of-work and only chains with more proof of work will win. Additionally, protecting from reorgs by expecting more confirmations would remain the same, such as the standard 6 confirmations for exchange-deposits. The issue of having a 3 or 4 deep fork is a problem in Bitcoin, but it has not happened for ages, and the miners prefer it that way. While excessive block concept provides a possible solution to this problem, it doesn't create it. Miners' policy is stored in the coinbase, and BU's node-local policy would not affect consensus rules.</p>
