    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has shifted away from appropriateness, but the fact remains that Bitcoin Core relies on hash collision for maintaining consensus. BIP30 is no longer checked since it can only be violated by a hash collision. Eric Voskuil and Tier Nolan discuss the possibility of duplicate txids due to hash collisions. Voskuil believes that hash collisions are not impossible and that the security of many parts of the system is based on this. However, Nolan argues that the qualifier should be added to those who make claims requiring hash collisions, rather than to those who assume they are not possible. They also mention the rare cases where address and script hashes can collide without harming Bitcoin's security, and that checkpoints do not affect Bitcoin's security. In summary, while there are specific handling rules for both block hash collisions and tx hash collisions, the security of Bitcoin does not assume that hashes never collide.</p>
