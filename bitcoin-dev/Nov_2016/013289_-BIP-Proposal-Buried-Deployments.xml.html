    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Kerin pointed out that BIP30 was given similar treatment as BIP34 after a reasonable amount of time had passed. However, another member of the list argued that this was not a valid comparison. According to them, BIP30 is not validated after BIP34 is active because blocks complying with BIP34 will always necessarily comply with BIP30. This is due to the fact that coinbases cannot be duplicated after they include the block height.</p>
