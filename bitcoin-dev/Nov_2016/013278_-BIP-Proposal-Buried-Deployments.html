    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent proposal by Bitcoin Core to simplify the consensus rules surrounding deployment of BIPs 34, 66 and 65 has been met with criticism from some in the community. The proposal suggests replacing the trigger mechanism for prior soft forks with a caching of the block heights at which the consensus rules became enforced. However, Eric Voskuil via bitcoin-dev has called the proposal a "horrible precedent" due to its hardcoding of rule changes based on large forks indicating catastrophic failure, poor process in regards to already shipping, and the lack of material performance optimization. Despite potential for a consensus split, the proposal is seen as unlikely to cause fundamental concerns about security assumptions in Bitcoin.</p>
