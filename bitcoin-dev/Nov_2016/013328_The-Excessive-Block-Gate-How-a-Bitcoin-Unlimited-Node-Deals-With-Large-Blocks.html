    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 26, 2016, Peter R via bitcoin-dev stated that it would be in the best interest of miners to set the same block size limit and signal reliably what that limit is, as Bitcoin Unlimited miners do. Interestingly, last week, the same concept was implemented into Classic, which will now respect the EB limit and put it in the coinbase. Tom Zander mentioned that the surprise may come from the difference in cost versus expected earnings of creating a block, which is quite significant. He runs a blog and Vlog, which can be found at <a href="https://zander.github.io">https://zander.github.io</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/tomscryptochannel,">https://vimeo.com/channels/tomscryptochannel,</a> respectively.</p>
