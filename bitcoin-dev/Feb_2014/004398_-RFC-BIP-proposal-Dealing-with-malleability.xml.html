    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter's proposal to implement transaction.version=3 has received rough consensus from the group. There is confidence that malleability can be squashed for IsStandard, SIGHASH_ALL transactions without the need for a proper proof of DSA signature un-malleability. However, some reservations were expressed regarding proposals to do things with nversion=1 transactions as well as the possibility of undiscovered malleability routes. Despite these concerns, the group agrees to proceed with Pieter's plan which is similar to what has already been executed but with the addition of a version check to make it sane to complete. It is acknowledged that getting wallets to start generating transaction.version=3 might take years, but this is deemed acceptable.</p>
