    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 28th, 2014, Warren Togami Jr. wrote an email mentioning that the transaction fees per kilobyte failed to account for the actual cost to the network. He further suggested that if Bitcoin had adopted a common-sense rule like this, he would not have had any reason to join Litecoin development last year. This was pointed out as one of the few economic design flaws that Satoshi Nakamoto overlooked in the original design. The email was sent to the Bitcoin developers mailing list and questioned whether there was any particular reason why the patch suggested would not make it into Bitcoin if submitted. Drak, one of the Bitcoin developers at the time, responded to the email but his response was not included in the context provided. Warren's email contained a link to a GitHub commit made by the Litecoin project which could provide more information on the issue at hand. However, no further details were given about the contents of this commit.</p>
