        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context explores the challenges of implementing changes to blockchain consensus systems while maintaining a decentralized structure. It discusses an email exchange between Luke-Jr and Peter Todd, in which they debate the idea of upgrading the embedded consensus system with new rules. While Luke-Jr argues that this would give developers too much power and assert central authority, Todd counters that users must accept the rule change, making it harder for developers to impose anything by fiat.The problem of double-spending assets due to a transition period where some users interpret new consensus rules is also addressed. The solution proposed is to split actions into separate "decrement" and "increment" operations to ensure v1 software can view the "decrement" of a balance even if it doesn't see the corresponding "increment." The analogy drawn is to proof-of-work (PoW) cases, and the general principle is referred to as an embedded consensus system soft-fork.The context also highlights the issue of tracking ownership of contested assets in digital asset transfer systems and the importance of good accounting systems for reversing fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, the author acknowledges the limitations of courts in legislating code and proposes model municipal and county ordinances as a solution.The author proposes writing contracts like IOUs and vouchers on the blockchain, with the legal contract outside of the chain for them to be enforceable. The legality of these contracts varies depending on the p2p asset being used. They also suggest that those considering investing in digital asset transfer systems should be warned that their value in general remains unproven and losing some or all of your investment is very possible, even probable.Finally, the context emphasizes the need to include relevant legal jurisdictions when transferring assets and the importance of generating a master digest representing the state of the consensus in the database to arrive at a consensus. Ultimately, the context stresses the importance of maintaining a decentralized structure and carefully considering any changes made to the consensus system to avoid creating a centralized power structure.The author suggests that it is important to build, test, use, and try embedded consensus systems in court to ensure they can be explained in simple language to the distributed de-centralized local court systems. Overall, the context emphasizes the need for caution when implementing changes to blockchain consensus systems and maintaining a decentralized structure to ensure network security and integrity. It also highlights the challenges associated with asset transfer and the importance of including relevant legal jurisdictions in the consensus process.</p>
