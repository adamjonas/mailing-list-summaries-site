    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated 2/28/14, Peter Todd discusses the possibility of a hard fork to enable marketplaces. Todd argues that one-sided trade is sufficient to test out the functionality of marketplaces before forking anything. He expresses his support for experimenting with this and is pleased with Alex/Killerstorm's work on "regular" colored coins. Todd disagrees with the argument that a Bitmessage-like network would be easy to front-run through a Sybil attack. In his opinion, marketplaces face difficulties because the data they are attempting to publish must be public. Todd believes that the primary goal of markets is trade itself rather than price discovery. Regarding historic data, Todd explains that actual trades are always public, and some archivers could collect and maintain old orders for historic bid and asks. He questions the honesty of records without proof-of-publication. Todd also discusses a reverse nLockTime that can make transactions invalid after a certain amount of time. While acknowledging potential concerns about double-spends, he believes that the advantages outweigh potential problems. Overall, Todd considers that more awareness needs to be raised regarding nExpiryTime.</p>
