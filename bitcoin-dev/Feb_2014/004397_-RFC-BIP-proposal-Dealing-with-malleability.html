    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated February 20th, 2014, Gavin Andresen suggested implementing Pieter's proposal quickly. Andresen agreed with Mike that it wouldn't take long for the core network to fully support this change. Although getting wallets to generate transaction.version=3 might take years, Andresen thought it was okay. He expressed reservations about proposals to make changes with nversion=1 transactions, which he thought were completely insane. Additionally, he was far from confident that all possible malleability routes had been uncovered, with a new entry being added by Pieter a couple of weeks before. Andresen also mentioned there being no proof of the absence of further algebraic malleability in DSA, although he felt it was unlikely and a solid proof of its absence was somewhat elusive.</p>
