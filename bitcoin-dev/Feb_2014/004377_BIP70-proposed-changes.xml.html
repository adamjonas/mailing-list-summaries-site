    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a question about the possibility of having a UNIX UTC timestamp field in customer payment messages. This could be important because, for many transactions, the exact time of payment is when it is made by the customer, not when requested by the retailer or later mined. The blockchain time can differ significantly from transaction time, so its value is limited.Small slices of time can greatly impact the transaction value. If we are ultimately taxed as a currency, an exact time will affect US GAAP accounting and the transaction's tax accounting. A time field may also support 'first come first served' retailer programs and time-sensitive promotions. Therefore, having a timestamp field in customer payment messages could be beneficial in various ways.</p>
