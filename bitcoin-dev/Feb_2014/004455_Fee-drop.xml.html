    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A mempool janitor change has been pushed out to the Github repository of Bitcoin. The aim was to create a simple, bolt-on change without rewriting the mempool code. Metrics will be run for 48 hours on what does and does not get into the public nodes' mempools, ending Friday midnight EST. Peter Todd raised concerns about whether a memory-limited mempool would be added prior to release in order to avoid an obvious low-risk DDoS exploit. Todd believed that the network bandwidth DoS attack mitigation strategy relies on transactions that are accepted to mempools getting mined, and the clearance rate of the new low-fee transactions is going to be pretty small. He suggested that it should be obvious to people how one can create large groups of low-fee transactions and then cheaply double-spend them with higher fee transactions to suck up network bandwidth. He also stated that releasing software that has known and obvious DoS attack vulnerabilities that didn't exist in the previous version is irresponsible on multiple levels. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, signed off by providing his contact details and BitPay Inc.'s website.</p>
