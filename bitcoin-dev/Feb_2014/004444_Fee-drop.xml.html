    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn expressed his disagreement with the claim that the recent fee drop in Bitcoin creates new vulnerabilities. He argued that the cost of an attack would remain the same as before, and that the clearance rate of low-fee transactions was not likely to be significant. However, he acknowledged that his opposition was unlikely to change anyone's mind. This message was sent via email and included a digital signature.</p>
