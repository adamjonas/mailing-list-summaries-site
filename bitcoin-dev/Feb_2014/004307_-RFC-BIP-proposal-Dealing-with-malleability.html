    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille proposed a BIP on how to eliminate transaction malleability over time. The proposal can be found at <a href="https://gist.github.com/sipa/8907691">https://gist.github.com/sipa/8907691</a>. He expects most rules to not be controversial, but rules 1 and 3 may require modifications to wallet software, which may invalidate some script functionality. However, these new rules remain optional and controlled by an nVersion increase. In response to Pieterâ€™s proposal, someone suggested that CHECKMULTISIG should require the dummy value to be exactly equal to OP_FALSE, as verifying it in the transaction itself is laborious. They also suggested that both CHECKSIG and CHECKMULTISIG fail the transaction if the signature is invalid but not exactly equal to OP_FALSE. But they were hesitant to bake in assumptions about malleability when there is no solid idea if ECC signatures are or are not malleable on a fundamental level. Moreover, they suggested a new CHECKSIG mode for cases where malleability must be eliminated, such as certain multi-party protocols, and fix wallet software instead. However, they could see this being an impossible goal engineering-wise. The malleability problems people see are closely related to inability to handle double-spends and reorgs.</p>
