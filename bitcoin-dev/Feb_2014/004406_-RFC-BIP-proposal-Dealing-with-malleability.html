    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and another individual on February 20th, 2014, they discussed the support for p2sh in the consensus code of bitcoinj. The sender mentions that p2sh had already been supported for a long time since its first creation. They also note that support for sending to such addresses in the wallet was added when an app demanded it. The market for wallets is competitive, so there will always be some skew in what features are worked on in what order. Finally, V3 transactions are a consensus change that wallets will pick up at different times like any other feature. They both agree that forcing constraints on current version transactions would be a deal breaker as wallets will pick up features at different times.</p>
