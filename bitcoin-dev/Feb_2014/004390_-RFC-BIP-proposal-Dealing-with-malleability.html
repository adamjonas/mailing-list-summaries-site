    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around a proposal to add an "only-mine-with-child flag" for chains of transactions. This would make parent transactions invalid unless spent together with the transaction that depends on it and only the original will have a child referencing it. Malleability is not an issue when broadcasting full transaction chains at once, but if pre-generated subchains need to be broadcast separately, the last child in the chain needs to be non-malleable. All miners need to start respecting this flag at once to avoid forking the network. The proposed change to make version 1 transactions unmalleable is not intended to avoid incidents, but rather a longer-term solution to provide non-malleability guarantees for clients willing to restrict their functionality. There are several intended use cases for malleable transactions, so this is not about outlawing malleability. New transaction and block versions allow implementing and automatically scheduling a soft fork without waiting for wallets to upgrade. However, it is not necessary for every wallet to be modified instantly, as long as software only spends confirmed change and tracks all debits correctly.</p>
