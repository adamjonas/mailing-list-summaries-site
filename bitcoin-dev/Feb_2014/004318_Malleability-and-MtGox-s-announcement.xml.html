    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Troy Benjegerdes, expressed his frustration with MtGox's lack of transparency and demanded more technical details on how they planned to resolve their scalability and usability problem. He argued that private off-list discussions about such issues were equivalent to insider trading, which was unfair to other customers. He suggested that if MtGox released its code stack under an AGPLv3 license, he and others on the list could come up with a workable solution, thereby cementing MtGox's position as a market leader in transparent cryptocurrency trading. Pieter Wuille responded to Troy's email by explaining that malleability of transactions had been a known issue for years and that it made it harder for infrastructure to interact with Bitcoin. He also noted that wallets that dealt poorly with modified txids and services that used the transaction id to detect unconfirming transactions were the two main problems that needed to be addressed. Pieter proposed defining a normalized transaction id as SHA256^2(normalized_tx + 0x01000000), where normalized_tx is the transaction with all input scripts replaced by empty scripts, as a way to identify transactions unambiguously. Another member of the list, Nick, replied to Troy's email, stating that MtGox very rarely commented on things publicly outside of IRC or their website. He emphasized that MtGox's problem was their own and that demanding access to their private code was not the solution. If customers felt wronged, they could sue the company, but otherwise, MtGox had no obligation to them.</p>
