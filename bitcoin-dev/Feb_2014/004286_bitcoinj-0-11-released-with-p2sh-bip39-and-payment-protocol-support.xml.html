    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread is a conversation between Peter Todd and Mike Hearn. In the first message, Peter Todd points out that XOR is a bad digest scheme because it's trivial to create collisions. In Mike Hearn's response, he announces the release of bitcoinj 0.11, a library for writing Bitcoin applications that run on the JVM and lists some users of the library. He also mentions that wallets can now send to P2SH addresses and that generated signatures now use canonical S values. Peter Todd responds with two bonus questions for budding cryptographers, offering 25mBTC each for correct responses. The first question asks why the three forms of signature - DKIM, long-lived bitcoin address, and Official Swiss Government Identity - failed to let him verify the right code. The second question asks who has the smallest work-factor for such an attack. In the final message, Peter Todd signs off with his email and Bitcoin key. The email also includes a link to a whitepaper on managing the performance of cloud-based applications.</p>
