    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Mark Friedenbach suggested that there is no need to design for 64-byte hashes and the 80-char line length comparison is a good point. He said that a little more room as a 32-byte hash or EC point + 8 bytes identifying prefix data is the bare minimum, but it is also very important that we send a message: This is for payment related applications like stealth addresses only. Don't burden everybody by putting your junk on the block chain. Wladimir agreed with him and supported bringing it down to 40 for 0.9. It would be enough. 80, as the standard line length, is almost asking for "insert your graffiti message here". And if this is not abused, these kind of transactions become popular, and more space is really needed, the limit can always be increased in a future version. Jeff Garzik proposed reducing the size from 80 but he thinks regular transactions should have the ability to include some metadata. However, even after including metadata, if the transaction fees are sufficient to pay the cost for whatever random junk anyone wants to put there, there is no need to charge for privacy by putting junk like stealth addresses in the blockchain.</p>
