        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 4th, 2014, Mike Hearn released Bitcoinj 0.11, a Java-based Bitcoin library that is widely used across the community in various applications such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android, MultiBit, Hive, blockchain.info, Circle, Neo/Bee, BitPOS.me, Bitcoin Touch, BlueMatt's relay network and DNS crawler, academic advanced contracts research and more. The release-0.11 git tag was signed by Andreas Schildbach's GPG key, with the commit hash being 410d4547a7dd. The paragraph was verified using DKIM and a key that was ID verified by the Swiss government. However, there have been questions raised regarding the verification process.Furthermore, the update allows wallets to send to P2SH addresses, and generated signatures are now using canonical S values, which will aid in a future soft-forking rule change banning malleable signatures.Peter Todd offered two bonus questions for budding cryptographers in response to the announcement and offered rewards of 25mBTC for correct answers. He also explained that XOR is a bad digest scheme because it's easy to create collisions. In the final message of the email thread between Todd and Hearn, Peter Todd signs off with his email and Bitcoin key. Todd posed a bonus question asking why the three forms of signature - DKIM, long-lived bitcoin address, and Official Swiss Government Identity - failed to let him verify the right code. The second question asks who has the smallest work-factor for such an attack.Additionally, Todd explained that in the case of a Merkle tree where data is timestamped at the bottom, XOR is a bad digest scheme because it's easy for an attacker to make a fake timestamp if the tree is using XOR instead of a proper hash function. Lastly, Jeff Garzik made a pun in response to Todd's bonus question, "Cryptographers smoke... hash, right?" implying that Todd may have been smoking cannabis. The email thread ends with Todd's signature and a digital signature attachment.The discussion also included concerns about the use of XOR in a Merkle Tree and the importance of using proper hash functions for greater security. Finally, the context discussed issues related to digital signatures and encryption in the Bitcoin community, including truncated Git commit hashes and incomplete PGP fingerprints.</p>
