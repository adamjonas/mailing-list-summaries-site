    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Troy Benjegerdes asked if there was anyone with commit access to the repository who could be considered independent of venture capital or other investment connections. Gregory Maxwell responded that he himself could be considered independent, though others may exist. Benjegerdes added that he was concerned about people who had signed non-disclosure agreements or whose salary and equity depended on those who were experts at manipulating markets. He suggested that the best outcome would be for MtGox to release their code under AGPLv3, allowing for a public technical discussion on how to fix it while still maintaining intellectual property ownership. However, he expressed doubt that such a move would happen as it would cut off a significant revenue stream for those who made market bets just before information went public. Benjegerdes also disclosed his emotional investment in copyleft/viral copyright development models and his occasional monetary gain from cryptocurrency mining. Jameson Lopp, a software engineer at Bronto Software, suggested that Benjegerdes take his ideas elsewhere as they were not relevant to the mailing list.</p>
