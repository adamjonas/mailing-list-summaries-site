    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core team has been working on improving the way the core code deals with double-spends, specifically malleable transactions. The issues related to double-spend handling were not a priority as they involved unsupported actions like copying wallet.dat to another machine and spending on both machines. However, pull requests have been implemented to address these problems. These include a command-line option to spend unconfirmed change only as a last resort, tightening up the IsStandard() rule, and reworking the core wallet code to implement "handle double spends better." Testing and code review are essential to release these changes. It is important for users of Bitcoin services to help develop, debug, test, and review the software rather than assuming that someone else has done the work.</p>
