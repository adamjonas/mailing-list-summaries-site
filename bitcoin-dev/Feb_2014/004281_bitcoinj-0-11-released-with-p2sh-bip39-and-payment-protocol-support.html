    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoinj 0.11, a Java-based Bitcoin library has been released by Mike Hearn. BitcoinJ is used across the community in various applications such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android, MultiBit, Hive, blockchain.info, Circle, Neo/Bee, BitPOS.me, Bitcoin Touch, BlueMatt's relay network and DNS crawler, academic advanced contracts research and more. The release-0.11 git tag was signed by Andreas Schildbach's GPG key, with the commit hash being 410d4547a7dd. The paragraph was verified using DKIM and a key that was ID verified by the Swiss government. A question has been raised regarding the verification process. Furthermore, the wallet can now send to P2SH addresses. Generated signatures are now using canonical S values, which will aid a future soft-forking rule change banning malleable signatures.</p>
