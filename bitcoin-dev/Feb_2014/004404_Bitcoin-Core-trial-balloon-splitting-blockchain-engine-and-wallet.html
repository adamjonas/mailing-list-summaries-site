    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The upcoming version 0.9 of Bitcoin Core will allow the disabling of the bitcoind wallet, which can be used purely for payment network access and management. This allows a more optimized border router profile by reducing process size by 40-200MB. Recent IRC discussions have proposed running the Bitcoin Core wallet as a separate process from the blockchain engine to accomplish a long-standing security goal of sandboxing away wallet keys and sensitive data from the network-exposed P2P engine. Simple forking was explored, but Windows requires an exec-like solution to create a new process. Separate programs seem better, using IPC: RPC + P2P, as modern OS's make localhost sockets just about as fast as other IPCs methods. Pieter has been working on headers-first sync, but moving along this wallet/blockchain engine split requires upping the review&test bandwidth on Pieter's PRs.</p>
