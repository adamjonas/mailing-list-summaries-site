    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Peter Todd raised concerns about the potential for a low-risk DDoS exploit with the implementation of a fee drop. He suggested that a memory-limited mempool prior to release could mitigate this issue. The clearance rate of new low-fee transactions is likely to be small, and in periods of high demand, there have been issues with mempool growth. Additionally, it would be easy to create large groups of low-fee transactions and cheaply double-spend them to consume network bandwidth. Todd also noted that releasing software with known and obvious DoS attack vulnerabilities that did not exist in the previous version is irresponsible. In response, Troy Benjegerdes suggested that including the change would be a good idea and asked for more information on what the DOS attack would look like so that he could trade in anticipation of the market crash. Finally, Benjegerdes commented on the advantage of Bitcoin being that people can learn from its mistakes and that it is not a one-size-fits-all fiat.</p>
