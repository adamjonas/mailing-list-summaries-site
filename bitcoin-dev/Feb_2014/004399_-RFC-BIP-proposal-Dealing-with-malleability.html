    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated February 20, 2014, Gavin Andresen requested a BIP number. Gavin agreed with Pieter's plan and stated that wallets generating transaction.version=3 could take years but it was okay. Gregory Maxwell also agreed with Pieter's proposal which they have been executing for some time already but with the version check to make it sane to complete. However, Gregory was far from confident that they have uncovered all possible malleability routes. He also added that they have no proof of the absence of further algebraic malleability in DSA. A proper proof of DSA signature un-malleability would be great, but he didn't think it was necessary to proceed.</p>
