        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a series of email conversations, Bitcoin developers discuss various issues related to the cryptocurrency. One developer, Troy Benjegerdes, asks for names of individuals with commit access to the bitcoin GitHub repository who are independent of venture capital or other investment connections. Another developer, naman naman, raises concerns about a DOS attack on bitcointalk.org. A response from a developer named Greg suggests that if someone resends a transaction without respending the prior transactions coins, they end up double paying. However, only spending the inputs in question can prevent the prior transaction (itself or in other form) from going through. Another developer, Drak, asks for an official response from Bitcoin Core developers regarding MtGox's assertion that their problems are due to a fault of bitcoin, not their own. In reply, a developer states that fault seldom falls in a single place. Bitcoin is at fault in many places for making it harder for implementers to get things right. MtGox is also at fault for not implementing in a way that copes with behaviors in the Bitcoin protocol which have been known since at least 2011. The developer goes on to explain how mutation handling is necessary but insufficient for cancellation security and how input tracking appears to be both necessary and sufficient in all cancellation cases. Finally, the developer expresses a willingness to help out with technical issues and notes that removing malleability entirely has been a soft long-term goal.</p>
