    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 27th, 2013, Mike Hearn posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the lack of a reliable testnet block explorer. He mentioned that the original blockexplorer.com was often broken, slow, and not maintained anymore. However, he provided an alternative, a new block explorer called Biteasy which also had a REST/JSON API. Hearn noted that the coinbase transaction may not necessarily come first in the listing due to it being sorted by "time received". The Biteasy site was built using bitcoinj, and the author could be contacted on IRC with the nick damethos.Additionally, Hearn shared some information on other testnet explorers. He provided a link to a free software testnet explorer based on javascript/node called test.bitcore.io. He also mentioned that he was working on a testnet explorer and planned to fork the Bitcore explorer to add semantic web style markup attributes to the HTML. Hearn shared a message from blockr.io stating that they planned to add testnet but could not provide an estimate as to when it would happen.</p>
