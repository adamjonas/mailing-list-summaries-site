    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is looking to add a memory limited mempool or something similar prior to release in order to prevent an obvious low-risk DDoS exploit. This is important because the network bandwidth DoS attack mitigation strategy relies on transactions being accepted to mempools and getting mined. The clearance rate of new low-fee transactions is expected to be small, which may lead to issues with mempool growth during periods of high demand. Additionally, there may be concerns about how large groups of low-fee transactions could be created and then cheaply double-spent with higher fee transactions to suck up network bandwidth.While core developers have done fairly well in addressing these concerns, there are still issues related to dust and fee management to consider moving forward. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin remains a good medium for microtransactions compared to other alternatives. Releasing software with known and obvious DoS attack vulnerabilities that didn't exist in the previous version would be irresponsible on multiple levels.Overall, the community must continue to work together to address these concerns and ensure the long-term stability and security of the Bitcoin network.</p>
