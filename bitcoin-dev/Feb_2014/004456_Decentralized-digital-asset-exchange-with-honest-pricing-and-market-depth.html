    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context begins with an apology for a delayed answer. The conversation then moves on to discuss cross-chain trading and the limitations of hard forks. Two methods are provided for cross-chain trading, which do not require a third chain. The conversation then shifts towards discussion on seller fairness and the proof of publication fee. It is predicted that most people will use the simplest, fastest and cheapest method for broadcasting orders. The primary goal of markets is trade itself, not price discovery. The actual trades are public, and some kind of "archivers" could collect and maintain old orders for historic bid and asks. An aside is made about nLockTime being nice to not always have to double-spend the inputs of an order to cancel it.</p>
