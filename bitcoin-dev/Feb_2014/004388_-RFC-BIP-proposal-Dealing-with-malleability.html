    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and other individuals on February 19, 2014, Todd raised concerns about the implications of retroactively changing the meaning of nLockTime in Bitcoin transactions. While it might be possible to do so currently, Todd argued that it could cause problems for proposed applications that rely on transactions or parts of transactions being mineable as is in the future. He suggested using this as a learning experience for what a version bump would look like infrastructure-wise. Todd also pointed out that there may be individuals who have sent funds to addresses with timed release conditions and then destroyed the keys to those addresses. This could potentially cause issues if existing transactions were made impossible to mine in the future. Todd noted that the concept of ANYONE_CAN_PAY could be useful in this kind of situation.</p>
