    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ronald Hoffman reported an issue with the 'services' field appearing garbled in the latest source code level from GitHub. He found that bitcoind is connected to his Java node server at 127.0.0.1:8333 and thought he was sending a bad 'version' message, but he got the correct results using 0.8.6. Therefore, it appears that something changed in 0.9.0. Warranting an issue on GitHub, Hoffman shared a conversation where he was using bitcoin-cli talking to bitcoind (0.9.0), showing "services" as "0000000164x". Wladimir asked what git revision Hoffman was testing with, built with what compiler on which platform. He further asked if all peers in getpeerinfo show up garbled or just Hoffman's. When Wladimir tried getpeerinfo locally, all his peers show as ""services" : "00000001" as expected.</p>
