        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Core team has been actively working on improving the core code to address the issues related to double-spends and malleable transactions. Initially, these problems were not given much priority as they involved unsupported actions such as copying wallet.dat to another machine and spending on both machines. However, pull requests have been implemented to address these problems, which include a command-line option to spend unconfirmed change only as a last resort, tightening up the IsStandard() rule, and reworking the core wallet code to handle double spends better.Testing and code review are crucial before releasing these changes to ensure their effectiveness and safety. It is essential for users of Bitcoin services to contribute towards developing, debugging, testing, and reviewing the software instead of assuming someone else will do the work. By doing so, users can help improve the reliability and security of Bitcoin services.</p>
