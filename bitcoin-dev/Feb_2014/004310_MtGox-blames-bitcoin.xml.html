    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated February 10th, 2014, Drak asked for clarification on the official response from Bitcoin Core developers regarding MtGox's claim that their problems were due to a fault of Bitcoin, rather than their own. The technical analysis prior to this issue was that MtGox was at fault for their faulty wallet implementation. A Reddit post provided a detailed explanation of what had happened in this situation.</p>
