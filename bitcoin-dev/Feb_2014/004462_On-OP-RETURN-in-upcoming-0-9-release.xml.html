    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Troy Benjegerdes and Warren Togami, the issue of transaction fees on the blockchain was discussed. Benjegerdes argued that either the transaction fees should be sufficient to cover any data added to the blockchain or the fee structure needed to be rethought rather than trying to regulate the addition of data. This was in response to a commit made by the Litecoin project on Github. Togami replied by stating that he believed the transaction fees per kilobyte had failed to account for the actual cost to the network, and that this was an economic design flaw that Satoshi overlooked in the original Bitcoin design. He also expressed his dislike of data storage in the blockchain, but acknowledged that it could at least discourage the creation of permanent UTXOs.</p>
