    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is about the implementation of BIP70 for payment protocol in face-to-face scenarios or real-time scenarios like ticket sales or gambling, and socket and/or Bluetooth type connections. Christophe Biocca explains that over HTTP, merchants cannot send a "Cancel Payment Request" to the user. If the customer does not want to send the payment, a "Reject Payment Request" to the merchant is useless. The unhappy path scenario with Payment Requests can be solved by the merchant refunding the money or the customer contacting the merchant and providing the signed request asking for the return of funds.Tim Tuxworth raises common business scenarios where a "Cancel Payment Request" message is required, such as when a merchant realizes they charged the wrong amount or sent the payment request to the wrong customer or when the customer decides to pay by another mechanism like cash or credit/debit. Tuxworth also suggests that a "Reject Payment Request" may be required or using the same message for both scenarios. The post author implemented BIP70 using combinations of either QR-code or NFC plus Bluetooth. A working preview app can be downloaded from the provided link.</p>
