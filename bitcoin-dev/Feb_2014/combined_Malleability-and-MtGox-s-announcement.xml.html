        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>MtGox's recent announcement regarding transaction malleability was not a surprise as it had been known for years. The problem makes it harder for infrastructure to interact with Bitcoin, but it is not considered a significant issue. Although progress is being made to make malleability harder, it will take years to resolve the problem completely. Two more direct issues resulting from this are wallets that deal badly with modified txids and services that use the transaction id to identify unconfirming transactions. The latter problem can be solved by making sure to create a double-spend of the first transaction when reissuing a transaction due to an old version that doesn't confirm. A way to identify transactions unambiguously has been proposed, which could make people more aware of malleability in a tangible way. Regarding the attack on MtGox, the attacker renames the transaction ID before it gets confirmed in the blockchain and stresses Gox support, referring to the original transaction ID. However, before crediting the funds back, Gox should form a new transaction moving at least one of the coins the prior transaction was spending and wait for that transaction to confirm. In September 2013, many people had stuck transactions because Mtgox was spending immature coins, and later it was noticed that they were producing transactions with invalid DER encodings. After people started using mutation to fix these transactions, it seems that Gox's wallet may have been in a state where it thought a lot of coins weren't spent that were and was reusing them in new transactions. If the attacker has a direct connection to MtGox, they can receive the transaction directly. MtGox had a PHP script that returned base64 data for all their stalled transactions, which was used by some people trying to unstick their transactions with honest intent and no idea it would confuse mtgox's software.</p>
