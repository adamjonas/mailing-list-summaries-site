    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The forthcoming 0.9 release of Bitcoin includes a change that makes OP_RETURN standard and allows attachment of small amounts of metadata to transactions. The change has caused some controversy, with people questioning the 80-byte limit on data storage. It is explained that this limit is based on 2x SHA256 or 1x SHA512, plus a tiny bit of metadata. Some arguments have been made for reducing the size of data storage. However, regular transactions should have the ability to include some metadata. There are also concerns about the endorsement of chain data storage. It is clarified that this change is not an endorsement of data storage in chain but rather a way to make data less damaging. Storing data in forever-unspendable TX outputs can bloat the UTXO for eternity. Therefore, it is suggested to have release notes explaining the change in the 0.9 release announcement.</p>
