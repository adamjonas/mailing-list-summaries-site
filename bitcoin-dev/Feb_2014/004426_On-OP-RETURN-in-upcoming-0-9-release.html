    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2014, there was a discussion on reducing the standard line length of Bitcoin transactions from 80 bytes to 40 bytes. The proposal was made to prevent graffiti messages and also because 64-byte hashes such as SHA512 were unnecessary in the context of Bitcoin. This reduction would allow regular transactions to include metadata without requiring an OP_PUSHDATA1 and simplify writing the OP_RETURN-as-standard BIP. It was suggested that if more space was needed in the future, the limit could always be increased in a future version. Gavin Andresen was included in the email thread discussing this proposal.</p>
