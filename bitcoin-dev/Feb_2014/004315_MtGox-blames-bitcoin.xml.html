    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about MtGox's assertion that their problems were due to a fault of Bitcoin rather than their own, an individual named Isidor Zeuner expressed hope that Bitcoin Core developers would not be pressured by MtGox into including a patch in the source code. However, another individual named Troy argued that this issue is not about developers but about venture capitalists taking money from unsuspecting investors. He suggested that people should not rely on the official PR-spin-war response approved by the official bitcoin developer PR-firm, who may be paid by competitors to MtGox. Troy also questioned whether anyone with commit access to the Bitcoin GitHub repository is independent of any venture capital or other investment connections. He suggested that anyone could create a copycatcoin and even run a fork of Bitcoin hosted by MtGox. Finally, Troy disclosed that he is available for consulting if anyone needs assistance setting up and hosting an independent source code repository with good automated regression tests.</p>
