    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the issue of upgrading an embedded consensus system with new rules and whether it asserts a central authority and gives developers too much power. There is no force to upgrade unless someone chooses to run an operating system with automatic updates. The bigger problem with asset transfer of assets, which do not solely exist in the blockchain, is including the consensus of relevant local and distributed legal jurisdictions. The only assertion of central authority is those who download and run the code and submit to whatever the code asserts they are supposed to do. The email concludes by stating that digital asset transfer systems remain unproven and that building good tools is the best that can be done. Dwelling on the underlying metaphysical nature of what those tools may or may not do from a social perspective is off-topic on this email list.</p>
