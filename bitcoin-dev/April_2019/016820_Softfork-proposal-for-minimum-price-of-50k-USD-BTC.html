    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 1st, Luke Dashjr proposed two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) - one to add a signed price field to Bitcoin transactions and the other to softfork a minimum price of $50k USD/BTC a year from that day. While the first BIP received appreciation, the second one received criticism from Peter Todd, who pointed out that there is no limit on the maximum supply of USD, making the proposal vulnerable. Another member of the community also criticized the proposal, saying that a minimum price would not allow Bitcoin to pass the SEC test of a viable asset. He added that prices have to be able to go higher and lower based on market demand and not tethering to perceived norms.</p>
