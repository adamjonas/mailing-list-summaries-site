    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ruben Somsen and ZmnSCPxj have been discussing the possibility of enabling light clients to verify a single block in isolation. Ruben proposes options like UTXO set commitments, BIP157/158 commitments or BIP141 fraud proof commitments. While BIP157 can function without commitments, UTXO sets can only be validated by running the entire blockchain. The issue of data unavailability arises when peers allow hearing of all chains while denying proof of the invalidity of some UTXO. Ruben suggests that this issue can be resolved by using BIP157/158 filters that contain UTXO spends and are committed to on-chain. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that it may be computationally expensive to run every input in a block through the filter of every past block. Ruben also points out that UTXO set commitments, utreexo commitments, or BIP158 filter digests need to be stored and transmitted over the network somehow. If these are committed to in the coinbase, they have to be stored in fullnodes at each block which may increase their resource usage. In summary, Ruben's current understanding of the options available for enabling light clients to verify a single block in isolation is (1) UTXO set commitments, (2) BIP157/158 commitments, and (3) BIP141 fraud proof commitments.</p>
