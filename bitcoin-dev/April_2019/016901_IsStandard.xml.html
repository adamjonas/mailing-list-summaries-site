    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is questioning whether non-standard transactions would be relayed by nodes and how to determine what they will accept. They provide several examples of such transactions, including a modified multisig 2-of-3 and p2sh transactions without signature verification. A response from ZmnSCPxj clarifies that P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH, and P2WSH are recognized as templates by most current nodes and are expected to be propagated by a majority of nodes. However, nodes can have any policy for propagating transactions. If a transaction does not pay out to these standard templates, it may not be propagated by most nodes but can still be coordinated with one or more miners to get it mined. The author provides links to various tools for making Bitcoin and Zcash transactions simple and private.</p>
