    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pavol Rusnak, the author of a wordlist for BIP39, has stated that they are in the process of finalizing it and that it is not yet live on Trezor. However, he believes that every wallet that uses BIP39 will eventually adopt this wordlist. In response to a question about the license associated with the BIP39 wordlists posted on Github, Elia was unsure whether usage for other projects was permitted and asked if anyone knew under which license these lists were published. Pavol Rusnak replied to this post, saying that there are no restrictions on using his wordlist and that they are currently finalizing the SLIP39 standard for splitting shares, which uses a different wordlist with better properties. The links to the SLIP39 standard and its associated wordlist can be found in his reply.</p>
