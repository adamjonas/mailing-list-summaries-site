        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Nathan Worsley, CTO of LocalCoinSwap.com, has proposed a missing feature in Bitcoin that would enhance the security of exchange cold wallet systems. In a message posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, he suggested an "integrated address" feature that would allow addresses to resolve into a Bitcoin address and a transaction message or identifier. According to Worsley, this would allow exchanges to receive payments from an infinite number of customers to a single address without needing to move multiple customer deposits from a hot address to a single cold address, thus simplifying the process of setting up and managing cold wallets. The integrated address would also have other benefits like lower fees for exchanges and easier provisioning of deposit addresses to new customers in a secure manner. However, the proposal may not be practical due to increased resource requirements per transaction and embedding identifying information into the blockchain which is generally bad for privacy. Nonetheless, Worsley believes this feature would be a godsend to all exchange developers if widely accepted. He proposes that the integrated address could work by combining the Bitcoin address with some kind of hex or other value, allowing users to choose the amount they wish to deposit themselves, but ensuring their deposits are uniquely trackable. It would help exchanges switch to a more secure alternative of having all customers depositing directly into their singular cold wallet address, eliminating the need for the "sweeping" step required to move multiple customer deposits from a hot address into a single cold address.</p>
