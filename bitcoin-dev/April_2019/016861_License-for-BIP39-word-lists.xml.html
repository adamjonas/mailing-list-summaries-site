    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the BIP39 wordlist, Pavol Rusnak, has confirmed that there are no restrictions on using it. However, a new standard called SLIP39 for splitting shares is being finalized and will use a different wordlist with better properties. This standard might be more suitable for Elia's project. The SLIP39 standard can be found on SatoshiLabs' GitHub page along with the wordlist. Elia had asked about the licensing associated with the BIP39 wordlists posted in the GitHub BIP repo for their own project. As there was no license associated with the lists provided on GitHub, they were not sure whether usage for other projects was permitted. It was unknown whether any other wallets would adopt this wordlist, which uses BIP39. Peersm.com is noted as a browser version to move coins by oneself, while bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets made simple are also available on GitHub. Torrent-live.org is provided as a good resource for dynamic blocklists for anti-spies and private torrents.</p>
