    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made to rewrite the Bitcoin codebase in Python for better pre and post merging abilities, faster operations, and better understandability. However, it was pointed out that while Bitcoin Core is open source software and can be re-implemented in Python, rewriting the entire codebase from C/C++ would introduce many bugs and be a huge undertaking with almost no benefit. Additionally, Python is less efficient than C/C++. As such, Bitcoin Core will not be changing languages for the entire codebase but individuals are welcome to port it to Python themselves.</p>
