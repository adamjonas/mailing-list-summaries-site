    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A community member has written and implemented two BIPs, one of which adds a signed price field to Bitcoin transactions and the other softforks a minimum price of $50k USD/BTC. However, some members of the Bitcoin developer community have pointed out that the second BIP could make Bitcoin fail the SEC test of a viable asset since it would never allow Bitcoin to pass due to its volatile nature and the need for prices to be able to go higher and lower based on market demand. Additionally, there is no limit on the maximum supply of USD, which poses a serious vulnerability in the proposal. The first portion of the first BIP is deemed excellent by the community as it can help attain HFT through pinning value at the time of trade for later unblock scaling as a mark to market tool.</p>
