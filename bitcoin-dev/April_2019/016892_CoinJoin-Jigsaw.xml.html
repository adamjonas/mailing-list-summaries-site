    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj posted an interesting post about payjoin on a mailing list. He mentioned that any non-equal-value coinjoin is easily solvable via value sudoku. However, the author of this post came up with something called "CoinJoin Jigsaw". It involves a send-to-self coinjoin transaction in which every input is ambiguously associated with an output. The author used minizinc to model it and created two users A and B who don't trust each other but trust a common party to orchestrate this CoinJoin Jigsaw for them. They want all their money atomically in this one transaction, with exactly 2 outputs - one for A and one for B. Both A and B should pay a fee proportional to the amount of inputs they added. The orchestrator picks the largest subset of A's and B's utxo and satisfies the CoinJoin Jigsaw properties. The model has been shared on Github. While it may not have practical utility, it is considered cool by the author.</p>
