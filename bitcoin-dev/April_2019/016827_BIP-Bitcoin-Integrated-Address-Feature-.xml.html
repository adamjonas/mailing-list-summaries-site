    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Nathan Worsley suggested that Bitcoin is lacking a feature in which an "integrated address" would be able to resolve into a Bitcoin address as well as a transaction message or identifier. He believes that this feature would enhance security for exchange cold-wallet systems by allowing them to receive payments from an infinite number of customers to a single address without needing to move multiple customer deposits from a hot address to a single cold address. This, in turn, would simplify the process of setting up and managing exchange cold-wallet systems by eliminating the need for a "sweeping" step.</p>
