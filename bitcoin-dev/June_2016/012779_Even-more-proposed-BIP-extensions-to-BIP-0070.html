    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andreas Schildbach explained that Protobuf was chosen over JSON for the Bitcoin P2P protocol due to its strong types and less vulnerability to malleability. He also noted that having coded both, he found Protobuf is equally easy to use as JSON. Another member of the mailing list expressed concern that protobuf may be harder to implement in some languages or on mobile devices. The discussion then moved to the issue of extending BIP70, with participants agreeing that orthogonal ideas should be separated into different BIPs. There was some debate around whether intervals should be flexible in the protocol, with one participant arguing against flexibility to prevent attacks designed to confuse users. They also suggested that the spec should be rigid with respect to response times and retry periods to encourage consistency among wallet vendors. Finally, the group discussed the need for UI standards and agreed that they are necessary and should be included in a BIP. Suggestions were made for specific requirements, such as showing unconfirmed transactions as distinct from confirmed and displaying visual indications of confirmation levels.</p>
