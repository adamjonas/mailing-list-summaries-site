    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list has addressed issues like the lack of identification and payment protocol using JSON. BIP75 was designed to solve these issues by allowing both parties in a transaction to share identity information in an out-of-band fashion. Both BIP70 and BIP75 provide flexibility with regards to extensibility of PKI usage, but currently only none or x509_sha256 is specified. A new BIP can be submitted for additional PKI types similar to how RFCs extend usage of ciphers for TLS. A wallet can be set up to automatically create BIP75 transactions for subscriptions, where service providers can approve the first transaction and store the public key for future use. The subsequent transactions are linked to the public key used for the first transaction, indicating that the subscription has been paid for. Additionally, the BIP75 InvoiceRequest message contains a memo field that can be used to include any additional subscription information required by the subscription provider. James MacWhyte suggests expanding the pki_data slot to allow new identity types, but they should be standardized in the BIPs that add them and use universal names.</p>
