    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the rationale behind BIP 151 and why libbitcoin (or any node) would want to support it. The use of BIP 151, when coupled with a yet-to-be-devised identity system, is understood for Bloom filter features. However, these features are client-server in nature. The concern arises with the application of identity to the P2P protocol (excluding Bloom filter features). The desire to secure against the weaknesses of BF is being casually generalized to the P2P network. The proper resolution is to move the BF features to a client-server protocol. The BIP does not make a case for other scenarios or contemplate the significant problems associated with key distribution in any identity system. Transaction censorship, peer censorship, fingerprinting, SPV, and groundwork for a "client-server" model over the P2P channel are some reasons why encryption should be used in Bitcoin. In conclusion, BIP 151 must be deployed together with an authentication scheme to protect against MITM during encryption initialization.</p>
