    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas proposes expanding Bitcoin URI's to include signatures. For BIP75 store and forward servers, DNS records would have the user's public key and URL of their store and forward endpoint. Expanding the Bitcoin URI would be useful for people who prefer not to rely on servers. In response to a discussion about subscriptions, Erik suggests that payment channels may not be appropriate for monthly subscriptions or nlocktimes. Merchants cannot send requests to users for future payments since users don't run servers to connect to. Instead, a minimum interval for subscriptions is needed and should be stored in the wallet so that the next month's payment can go out on time. Support for varying currency conversion needs to be baked into wallets, which can be achieved by adding advisory subscription information to the payment request. Andy suggests a model where service providers could deliver invoices, receipts, and payment requests in a standardized and secure way. This would eliminate the need to log into multiple websites to pay bills and promote payment channels or sending another payment request instead of recurring payments from a single payment request. Erik concludes that BIP 75 should remain unchanged, with subscription information in the PaymentACK. The wallet re-initiates an invoice after the subscription interval has passed.</p>
