    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion, the topic of a new BIP is brought up, with the suggestion that the existing BIP75 from Netki is too specific and reliant on the domain name system. However, it is pointed out that BIP75 is actually designed to be independent of any name resolution system and can be used with a static URL or even for implementing a mesh-network payment system over Bluetooth. BIP75 provides a way for a client to get a new payment address for every payment, which is seen as better than BIP47 for uses such as subscriptions. The discussion also touches on identity methods other than x509, with the suggestion that users should be able to identify themselves with any selection of identity systems. It's noted that the pki_data slot should be constantly expanded to allow new identity types and that they should be standardized in the BIPs that add them and given universal names.</p>
