    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the importance of classifying systems based on available data to condition and status of other seals. The proof's contents are able to commit to new data, such as the transaction spending the output associated with the seal. The "condition" returns that "new data." Related work on UTXO-based smart contracts is also mentioned, with Typecoin being one such example where a contract language is based on logic, making it powerful and analyzable. However, the paper doesn't mention any performance details, and it looks very unusual to people who aren't used to type-oriented programming. Another system discussed is Generic coins, which describes a generalized Bitcoin-style system that can be easily referenced in research. Lastly, flexichains is a prototype that unifies account-based and UTXO-based models in a single model, implemented using tuples (pubkey, balance, last_update) as records, or transaction outputs including a spent flag for UTXO-based systems.</p>
