    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the complexity of the proposed construction comparable to that of Bitcoin itself, and whether decentralized anonymous credentials is applicable to the authentication problem posed by BIP151. The core problem posed by BIP151 is a MITM attack where the implied solution requires that a peer trusts that another is not an attacker. The benefits of BIP151 would increase the risks for MITM attackers, and with BIP151, there would be a basic tool-set to effectively reduce the risks of being MITMled. The only valid risk mentioned is the false sense of security, which could be countered by deploying BIP151 together with the simplest form of authentication. The discussion should focus on the risks and benefits of BIP151 and not drag into the realm of authentication, which can be done once proposals for authentication are available.</p>
