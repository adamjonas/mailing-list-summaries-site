    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BIP 0070, which allows signed payment requests for Bitcoin transactions, has seen moderate success, however, its complexity has hindered its widespread adoption. BIP70 requires an https server to serve the requests, making it impractical for most end-users. To achieve authenticated requests without requiring an https server, an extension of the Bitcoin URI scheme has been proposed using DNSSEC and EC private key signatures. The extended URIs can be shared by QR code or SMS text, allowing for authenticated requests without the need for a large infrastructure. While subscriptions in BIP70 are lacking, a proposal recommends the use of BIP0047 payment codes instead of wallet addresses when establishing subscriptions. Interval confirmations should begin at least one day in advance of the next payment. JSON is recommended over protocol buffers as it is easier to use and explain, and supports multi-mode identity mechanisms on both payment and subscription requests. The identity verification URI scheme is expected to be independent of the payment request itself. Erik Aronesty has suggested an identity-protocol-agnostic BIP with solid implementation of major protocols without any mention of payment URIs, and has offered to implement plugins for identity protocols if others think this is a good idea.</p>
