    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list on 21st June 2016, Luke Dashjr expressed his opinion that X509 should remain supported as it is entrenched. He also mentioned that PGP might make sense for those who are already using it but it does not provide any real security for un-Web of Trust (WoT)-networked users. However, the problem with PGP is that very few people use it. In response, Peter Todd asked how else Keybase could accomplish what they're accomplishing, with the same security model.</p>
