    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Erik Aronesty discussed the practicality of maintaining infrastructure for payment protocol. He noted that only large merchants are capable of doing so, as even Coinbase had recently experienced a failure when they forgot to update their certificate. Aronesty believes that such infrastructure is impractical for end users. Another participant in the thread, Andy, added that payment protocol is not necessary for face-to-face transfers and is mainly used for purchases from sites like purse.io. Additionally, there is an unencrypted version of BIP70 available via Bluetooth that is already being used in several thousand face-to-face trades per day.</p>
