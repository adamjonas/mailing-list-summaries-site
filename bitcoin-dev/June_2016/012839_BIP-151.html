    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Peter Todd and Eric Voskuil, it has been mentioned that the BIP151 protocol can be used to detect a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Similar to PGP, some users may not properly check keys which makes them vulnerable to MITM attacks. However, BIP151 provides users with the tools to detect such attacks. It is difficult for attackers to distinguish between users who check keys and those that do not, so if an attacker MITMs any user, there is a chance they will run into a user who checks keys and alerts others. The key point is to get everyone's communications encrypted first, as if this is not done, MITM attackers can intercept 99% of communications without risk of detection, by finding users with unencrypted communications.</p>
