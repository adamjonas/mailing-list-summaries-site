    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin standards and compliance, James MacWhyte shared a link to Netki's AML/KYC compliance product. While the product may be useful for confirming who is sending money in certain situations, it could have a negative impact on fungibility and privacy. Therefore, it's undesirable to bake this feature into standards. Similarly, the W3C should not be standardizing DRM. However, allowing people to identify themselves, in some cases with an online-only identity that isn't tied to their real-world identity, can be useful for developing new use cases. Peter Todd suggests that it's easy to confirm who is sending money by giving out different addresses to different people and keeping those addresses private.</p>
