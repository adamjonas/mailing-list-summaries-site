    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Alex Mizrahi and Peter Todd discusses the concept of closed seals, which is a useful construct for smart contracts, value transfer/currency systems, etc. The discussion also covers the scalability properties of this concept, where it is explained that various techniques can shorten history proofs in different ways depending on the application's needs. Additionally, the process of creating and transferring tokens is outlined, including defining a token's genesis state, asking for an authorization expression, and closing seals over new states committing to the chosen seal. The oracle does not need to know what the seals have been closed over and its storage is an implementation decision. Finally, the discussion highlights the importance of checking if entries were added to the oracle's map, and how the entry record can be communicated in just 3 * size_of_hash_digest bytes.</p>
