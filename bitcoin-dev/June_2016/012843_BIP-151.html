    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer believes that unauthenticated link level encryption is great because it forces attackers to use active attacks. They state that stopping passive attacks should be a priority and that automated and secure peer authentication in a mesh network is an unsolved problem in computer science. The writer suggests a simple way to get 'some' authentication by asking for the fingerprint of peers from other peers, as well as using semi-trusted index nodes for authentication. In response to this, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev argues that Bitcoin addresses also require authentication and questions why the writer assumes that their emails are not coming from the NSA. Eric Voskuil via bitcoin-dev points out that BIP151 does not provide tools to detect attacks that require authentication, but has a session ID for the purpose of an "out of band key check."</p>
