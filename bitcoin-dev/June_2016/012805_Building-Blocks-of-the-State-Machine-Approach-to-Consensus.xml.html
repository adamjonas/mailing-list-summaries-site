    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the participants discuss the usefulness of classifying systems with respect to what data is available for conditioning. They also touch upon the fact that implementing such a system can lead to tight coupling and difficulty in scaling. The contents of proof are supposed to commit to new data, such as the transaction spending the output associated with the seal. The key aspect of this idea is being able to close seals over some data, particularly another seal, which makes it useful for smart contracts, value transfer/currency systems, etc. The participants also discuss seal authorization condition functions, including checksig operators that check cryptographic signatures. Some related work on UTXO-based smart contracts is mentioned, indicating that many projects are working along similar lines.</p>
