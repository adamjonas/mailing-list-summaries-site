    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 23, 2016, on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd suggested that BIP75 should be removed from the bips repository and boycotted. He argued that it was bad strategy for Bitcoin developers to willingly participate in AML/KYC, just as it was bad for Tor to add wiretapping functionality and W3C to support DRM tech. Pieter Wuille responded by stating that he did not think it was a good idea to censor a BIP because it was considered bad practice. He went on to say that he had no issues with editorial control over what was in the bips repo, but that this did not prevent others from publishing elsewhere. Wuille also expressed his belief that the idea of the bips repo being a pure publication platform wasn't a good one and didn't match reality; by accepting bips, they were putting a stamp of some kind of approval on them. He gave an example of how he doubted he would be able to get a BIP for a decentralized assassination market protocol standard into the repository, regardless of whether or not it was used - simply because it was too controversial and distasteful for them to want to merge that.</p>
