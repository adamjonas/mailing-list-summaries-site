        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 141 has updated the segregated witness consensus rule. The definition of a witness program has been extended to 2-40 bytes from 2-32 bytes. Previously, only a witness programme input was allowed to have witness data and scripts larger than 32 bytes needed to be recorded in the witness field. The update means that up to 16*2^64 versions can be created for future upgrades. Scripts with a 1-byte push followed by a push of between 33-40 bytes were not considered to be a witness program before the update, but now they will fail due to an incorrect witness program length. Those running a segnet node or a testnet node with segwit code are advised to upgrade to the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7910">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7910</a>. If you have an alternative implementation, ensure your consensus code is updated accordingly, or your node may fork off the network.</p>
