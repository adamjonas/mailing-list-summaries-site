    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin developer mailing list, Peter Todd argued against the inclusion of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) tools in Bitcoin, saying it was bad strategy for developers to participate in AML/KYC. He compared it to adding wiretapping functionality to Tor software and supporting digital rights management technology by W3C. He suggested that companies or individuals who want and need AML/KYC can find ways to do it at their side, isolated from the entire network, and the solutions shouldn't come from upstream. The built-in AML/KYC tools might draw expectations from all users from authorities. Todd called for BIP75 to be removed from the bips repository and urged people to boycott wallets that implement it.</p>
