    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a perceived resistance to making Bitcoin usable for the average person, with BIP0075 being introduced to enshrine a DNSSEC protocol for giving wallet addresses memorable names. The primary focus of BIP 75 is to allow users to exchange data as they choose, without risking that a service provider can access it. Justin Newton, CEO and Founder of Netki, suggests that users who do not want a service provider to see their information even ephemerally can use software wallets like breadwallet or others, which only exist on their phone and the phone of their counterparty. If a user chooses to use a hosted platform and store their identity data there, it could be subject to a subpoena, the same as when they host their email. To protect user privacy and fungibility, BIP75 was designed to allow people who want or need to exchange identity info the option to exchange it in a standards-based way directly between peers without touching the blockchain or network itself.</p>
