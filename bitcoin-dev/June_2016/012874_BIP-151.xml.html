    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the insufficiency of BIP151 to protect against MITM attacks, and how node identity can address this issue. However, there is concern about the yet-to-be-specified requirement for node identity, which is not self-authentication. The implementation of Tor support in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 is mentioned as a possible solution, as it encrypts node-to-node connections and uses self-authenticated onion addresses. However, there are concerns about the pressure to expand node identity and the potential for the registrar to control access to the network if reliance on good node registration becomes widespread. Overall, the safety of using Tor with the Bitcoin P2P protocol is still under research.</p>
