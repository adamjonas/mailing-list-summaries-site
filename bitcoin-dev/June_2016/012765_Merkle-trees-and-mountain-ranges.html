    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Bram Cohen and Peter Todd discussed the need for commitments to be made regarding unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) and spent transaction outputs (STXO). Todd proposed that there should only be transaction output (TXO) commitments, but Cohen argued that this would not be enough to provide all necessary functionality. Cohen described his proposal for using a Patricia trie data structure, which he believes would provide sub-1 cache miss per update due to the amortized merging together of old mountains. However, Todd was confused by Cohen's description, as it did not match his implementation of Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMR). Todd also pointed out the difficulties with maintaining performance of cache misses when dealing with increasingly large UTXO/STXO/TXO sets.</p>
