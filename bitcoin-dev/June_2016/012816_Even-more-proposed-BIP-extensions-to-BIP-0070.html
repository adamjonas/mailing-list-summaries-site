    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Peter Todd suggests that BIP75 should be removed from the bips repository and wallets that implement it should be boycotted. He argues that participating in AML/KYC is bad strategy for Bitcoin developers. On the other hand, Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet, defends BIP75 by stating that it gives parties transacting complete control over who they choose to share their identity information with. The proposal allows users to authorize who they choose to give their payment address to, while still keeping communication and payment info encrypted against third party snooping. Although some people may use this identity information for AML/KYC purposes, it doesn't detract from the fact that it gives bitcoin users the tools they need to keep their payment information private and only communicate it with the parties they choose.</p>
