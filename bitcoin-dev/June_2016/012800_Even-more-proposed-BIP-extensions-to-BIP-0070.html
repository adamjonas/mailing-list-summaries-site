    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The need for people to make repeated payments to individuals in real life without making a formal payment request has been recognized, particularly in cases where payee and payer know each other well. However, for subscriptions, it may be better to promote payment channels or send another payment request. A model has been proposed where service providers deliver invoices, receipts, and payment requests in a standardized and secure way. This would include an open payment channels tab and a "bills to pay" tab, with everything automated and consolidated locally. Recurring payments from a single payment request may not be necessary if this model is adopted. The importance of subscriptions for Bitcoin to be used as a real payment system has been recognized.</p>
