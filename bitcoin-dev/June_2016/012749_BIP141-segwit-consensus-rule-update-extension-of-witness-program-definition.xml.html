    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr and Johnson Lau discussed the possibility of extending the definition for scripts with a 1-byte push followed by a push of 40 bytes. Lau suggested making it even bigger, up to 75 bytes, which Dashjr did not see a sufficient answer to. However, Pieter explained that a softfork to redefine such scripts would be complicated due to the limit in place preventing the use of the witness field. Dashjr proposed extending the definition to 33 bytes, allowing for 16*256 new script versions assuming the use of a 32-byte program hash. He also noted that a witness program larger than 40 bytes would be more expensive and take up more UTXO space without being useful. The safety of a 32-byte hash was also mentioned, and a potential hard fork if it is deemed unsafe.</p>
