    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message posted on bitcoin-dev raises concern over transaction censorship, peer censorship and fingerprinting. Encryption alone cannot protect against a MITM attack in an anonymous and permissionless network. However, the ability to detect MITM attacks is a significant step forward since even a small subset of users that do necessary checks can alert the wider community who can respond with stronger security measures. It's worth noting that many attackers are disincentivized by the fact that their actions have a reasonable probability of detection, as revealed in the Snowden leaks. Therefore, it's better to save the effort until the need for more costly security measures is more obvious. Peter Todd's signature is also included in the post.</p>
