    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the efficiency of JSON messages versus protocol buffers has been ongoing. While some believe that JSON is more appropriate for ease of use and extensibility, others argue that it is too prone to inefficiency and parser bugs. Despite the fact that even protobuf encoding isn't deterministic, it is still favored over JSON due to its more reasonable ability to perform dynamic parsing of messages. However, neither option is without its issues, so there is no clear alternative at this time. Those who handle security-critical software handling money may not view ease of use as a good criteria, and therefore, may prefer to stick to the more efficient protocol buffers despite their imperfections.</p>
