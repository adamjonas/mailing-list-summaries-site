        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In June 2016, Daniel Weigl proposed a BIP for a P2SH accounts protocol and requested feedback from the community on Github. Aaron Voisine, co-founder and CEO of breadwallet, also asked about the upcoming implementation of segwit version 2 with schnorr signatures and if there was a way to support it without using a third derivation path. A proposal has been made to include "native" P2WPKH addresses along with P2WPKH over P2SH addresses in compatible wallets. It is suggested that every fully BIP-compatible wallet must support both address types, with different chain IDs used to differentiate between them. There is concern regarding the privacy implications of using different output types for change outputs in transactions. To address this, it has been suggested to always use the same output type for the change output for "normal" send-to-single-address transactions if the wallet is able to recognize it. Another suggestion is to pick a change output at random, mimicking one of the sending outputs. To further enhance privacy, it is recommended to match the template of the redeemscript/witnessscript as well. Jochen has recommended that not only P2WPKH over P2SH addresses should be considered but also "native" P2WPKH addresses and that every fully BIP compatible wallet should support both types of segwit addresses. However, there is no final decision yet on how the address encoding for P2WPKH public keys should look like as Bip141 is deferred.</p>
