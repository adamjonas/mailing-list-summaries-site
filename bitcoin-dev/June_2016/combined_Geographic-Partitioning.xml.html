        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The writer proposes a solution for scaling electronic cash by partitioning Bitcoin addresses based on geographic location. This would require users to give up non-locality in order to make Bitcoin more scalable. The partitioning scheme can be hierarchical with partitions at the city, state, and country level. However, there is a problem when an address in partition A wants to pay an address in partition B which should be done by processing the transaction in partition A first and then including a hash of that block in some block in partition B.The proposed system benefits smaller merchants who can accept payments from local addresses only while larger merchants can verify transactions across two or more partitions. Despite concerns about 51% attacks on partitions, nodes could process transactions at random to balance computing power across all partitions. In conclusion, the writer believes that non-locality should be given up by users for electronic cash to scale.</p>
