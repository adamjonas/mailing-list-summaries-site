    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the writer mentions about the insecurity of using SHA256(key|cipher-type|mesg) as a MAC because of the length extension property of SHA256. The attacker can easily forge a tag protected by SHA256(key|cipher-type|mesg). To know more about it, one can refer to a link provided in the context. The discussion is regarding the use of SHA512_HMAC and SHA256_HMAC in Bitcoin development. A developer suggests using SHA256_HMAC instead of SHA512_HMAC for header encryption key and body encryption key. However, another developer argues that SHA512_HMAC is used by BIP32 and most clients will make use of BIP32 features. Moreover, SHA256_HMAC is not used by the current p2p & consensus layer of Bitcoin-Core. Finally, Rusty Russell says that he was looking at appropriating the work for lightning inter-node comms and adding another hash algo seemed unnecessarily painful. He also confesses his ignorance of why HMAC is used instead of just SHA256(key|cipher-type|mesg).</p>
