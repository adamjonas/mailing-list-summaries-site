    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Chris Priest is building a standalone system to archive and serve memos for Bitcoin wallets. The system would allow wallet users to move from one wallet to another without losing their memos. The memos will be encrypted, stored on memo servers, and the public key will be propagated so that they can be shared amongst different servers. The specifics of how the memos will be encrypted have not been set in stone yet, but it is important that they are encrypted strongly. The memos should also support different types of data and the memo server shouldn't be tied to a specific wallet schema. Users should only need to provide their memo-specific identifier to the memo server, which isn't necessarily related to any part of the user's wallet. There should be multiple memo servers, and users could decide which ones to entrust their data with.</p>
