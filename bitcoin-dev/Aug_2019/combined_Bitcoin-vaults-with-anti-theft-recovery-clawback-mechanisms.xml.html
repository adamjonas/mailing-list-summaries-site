        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bryan Bishop has proposed a new multisig scheme where a group can participate with provably-unknown ECDSA keys. In response to a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, he proposed a solution to one of the biggest problems with the vault scheme, which is an attacker silently stealing the hot wallet private key. He suggests choosing a stipend or withdrawal amount per withdrawal period like x% of the funds. A proposal for implementing Bitcoin vaults without the need for soft-forks or software upgrades has been suggested. The scheme binds both users and attackers to use a public observation and delay period before a weakly-secured hot key is allowed to arbitrarily spend coins. This is called pre-signed vaults. The security of this scheme is enforced by pre-signing transactions and deleting private keys. Bishop notes that having a vault construction might go a long way to discourage would-be attackers. The article describes various techniques for improving the security of Bitcoin vaults. It discusses the 'delete-the-key' trick which involves pre-signing a transaction and deleting the private key to lock in that course of action. However, it doesn't work well with multisig scenarios because nobody would trust that anyone else in the scheme has actually deleted the secret.The article also suggests using alternative fee rates and storing parameters for generating the remainder of the tree to optimize the process. Another technique involves recursively-enforced multi-party multisig bitcoin vaults where a single script template is used but populated with different parameters. Moreover, the article discusses fail-deadly mechanisms, key rotation for vaults, single-use seals, and paid defection. Additionally, the article discusses the advantages of financial privacy for custody and segregated vaults, besides being useful for personal cold storage solutions.This is an email thread from the bitcoin-dev mailing list, with Bryan Bishop as the author. The email includes links to transcripts about building on Bitcoin and closed-seal sets and truth lists for privacy. Bishop also acknowledges several people who helped him with his draft, including Jeremy Rubin, Bob McElrath, Andrew Poelstra, Joe Rayhawk, and Tadge Dryja. The email concludes with Bishop's contact information.The emails exchanged between ZmnSCPxj and Bryan provide details about re-vaulting transactions and their limitations. There seems to be a limit to the number of times a vault can be used as the number of times the vault setup function is run is the limit on the number of re-valuings possible. The total number of pre-signed transactions isn't really that high, and with exponential backoff on the relative timelock values, you can have high-resolution timelocks well into the future.In another email conversation, Peter Todd and Bryan Bishop discussed different techniques for securing Bitcoin transactions. They explored the technique of "delete-the-key", where the private key is pre-signed and then deleted to lock in that course of action. However, this doesn't work well for multisig scenarios because nobody would trust that anyone else in the scheme has actually deleted the secret. They also discussed the possibility of each party deleting a separate private key that's used in an m-of-n fashion, requiring 1/n honest deletes. Finally, they touched on the idea of multisig gated by ECDSA pubkey recovery for provably-unknown keys.Overall, these discussions provide insights into various proposals and techniques for securing Bitcoin transactions and vaults, and highlight the importance of addressing potential security vulnerabilities in cold storage mechanisms. The article also explores different techniques for improving the security of Bitcoin vaults, such as alternative fee rates, key rotation, single-use seals, and paid defection. The email conversations between Peter Todd and Bryan Bishop also discuss the idea of a "prepare to spend" transaction, deleting private keys in multisig scenarios, and provably-unknown ECDSA keys. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj and Bryan exchange emails about re-vaulting transactions and their limitations. The article concludes with Bishop's contact information and references to related works. Bishop proposed a solution to limit the total stolen funds to x% by choosing a stipend or withdrawal amount per withdrawal period. The article describes various techniques for improving the security of Bitcoin vaults, including pre-signed vaults, alternative fee rates, key rotation, single-use seals, and paid defection. The article also discusses the advantages of financial privacy for custody and segregated vaults, besides being useful for personal cold storage solutions.</p>
