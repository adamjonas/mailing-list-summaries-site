        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A team has developed CoinVault, a second layer technology that aims to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies "unstealable and unlosable". This technology ensures the safety and security of cryptocurrencies for both individuals and enterprises. However, cryptocurrency exchanges act as custodial escrow agents for trading entities participating on their platforms, which creates a problem of keeping third-party funds safe and secure.To solve this issue, the proposed scheme is a transaction method between two parties, the First Party and the Second Party. The Second Party acts as a secure cryptocurrency exchange and/or wallet for the First Party. The method presumes that unrecoverable hardware wallets and time locks for transaction outputs are available for the cryptocurrency system of interest. The process begins with the First Party creating a Deposit Transaction. In this transaction, an arbitrary sum of funds/tokens is transferred to a multi-signature address, which requires signatures from the First Party's private key generated signature, First Party's hardware token generated signature, and Second Party's private key generated signature to authenticate and spend/transfer from it. The First Party then creates a Provisional Transaction spending all the funds/tokens sent to the multi-signature address in the Deposit Transaction and sends a copy of the Provisional Transaction without any signed inputs or signatures to the Second Party. Once the Deposit Transaction is confirmed, both parties start monitoring the cryptocurrency network using third-party services for transactions referencing the Multi-Signature output address to detect any breach of security or foul play. Subsequently, either party can add missing signatures to the partially signed Provisional Transaction in their possession and broadcast them when necessary. As soon as the Provisional Transaction is broadcasted, the cryptocurrency monitoring systems prompt both parties to initiate recovery if it is not broadcasted by them to begin with. Either way, the First Party or the Second Party in coordination with the other can create and broadcast a transaction using the respective options of the Provisional Transaction transferring the funds/tokens to a desired address terminating the arrangement.The method of securing cryptocurrency exchange transactions can be extended to cover the contingency of lost private keys by reordering, adding or removing options in the Provisional Transaction. The Second Party gets first claim on funds/tokens but cannot steal from First Party since this would result in loss of trust and legal proceedings. If First Party and/or Second Party are compromised, remedial steps can be taken to reconcile the situation.Apart from using Hardware Tokens for added security, there are other options that can be used to offer better protection than multi-signature arrangements. One alternative is the use of relative/absolute timelocks, which can be used to limit the window of opportunity for hackers to gain access to digital assets. This involves setting a specific time period during which transactions can be made, after which any attempts to make changes or transfers will be denied.If compromise does occur, it is important to take remedial steps to reconcile the situation. This may involve freezing accounts, resetting passwords, or other actions to prevent further damage. By having these measures in place and being vigilant about security, individuals and organizations can help ensure the safety of their digital assets.</p>
