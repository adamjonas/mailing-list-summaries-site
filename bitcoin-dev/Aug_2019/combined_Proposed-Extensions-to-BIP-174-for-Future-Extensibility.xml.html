        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Andrew Chow has proposed extensions to the BIP 174 PSBT. These extensions include reserving certain types for proprietary use, which range from 0xF0 to 0xFE. The intention is that these types will not be used by the public specification and are instead intended for private use by individuals and organizations who require additional data attached to a PSBT. In addition to this, Chow suggests implementing a global version type and field represented by the version number 0xEF. This acts as a safeguard in case a backward incompatible change is introduced to PSBT. Lastly, Chow proposes using a canonical method for multi-byte types, designating 0xFF as the designated type, followed by the actual type for the data. For proprietary use types, a vendor-specific prefix that serves as a unique identifier will precede the actual type. The consensus is to use Compact Size Unsigned Integers for the field types.The discussion in the email thread revolves around the format of private types in Bitcoin BIP174. One participant suggested that private formats should have a basic format with a prefix to avoid confusion, while another suggested using compact size unsigned integers for variable length integer encoding, which is already used in the BIP for other fields. However, there are some issues with using CSUints for proprietary use types as it doesn't translate well and makes things harder. Andrew Chow proposed that a proprietary type value of 0xFC be followed by a variable-length string that serves as a unique identifier. This will then be followed by the actual type for the data defined by the user of the proprietary type. The prefix will just be a string prefixed with a compact size unsigned integer, and if no prefix is wanted, a single 0x00 byte can be used. Public software does not need to handle these proprietary types, so they do not need to check the string or the data type.</p>
