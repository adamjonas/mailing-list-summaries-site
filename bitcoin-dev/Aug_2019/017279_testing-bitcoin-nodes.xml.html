    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is a gentle reminder from Niels, a software test specialist who runs a private full Bitcoin node based on Raspberry Pi 4. He is seeking guidance and information regarding the tests performed during installation, upgrading and compilation of the software for the node. Niels has been trying to figure out the common test approach, refine test cases and try some manual tests as part of his learning process. Niels is requesting someone to join him or share any relevant information that can guide him in his pursuit of knowledge. He mentions that the tests on GitHub are not helpful for him and he would like to know what/how is tested to refine test cases. The email concludes with a standard disclaimer from Improve Quality Services B.V., which states that the email and any files transmitted may contain proprietary and confidential information and any unauthorized disclosure, use, dissemination, forwarding, printing or copying of this email and its attachments either whole or partial of its contents is strictly prohibited.</p>
