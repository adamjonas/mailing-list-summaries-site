    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Chris, ZmnSCPxj discusses the importance of the superlinear V^2 term in protecting the fidelity bond system from sybil attacks. However, this comes at the cost of greatly strengthening aggregation. ZmnSCPxj proposes a scenario where he approaches two makers with roughly equal bonds and offers to aggregate their bonds, resulting in a combined bond that has four times the weight of other makers due to the V^2 term. This allows him to earn almost four times what one maker does by offering 1.5x what one maker earns to both makers and keeping just below 0.5x for himself. This way, he earns without putting any of his money into bonds and gains an advantage over non-aggregating spies by learning a little below 4x more CoinJoins than other makers. However, this does not fix the root issue of makers who make for the purpose of gathering privacy information, even if it might fix sybil attackers.</p>
