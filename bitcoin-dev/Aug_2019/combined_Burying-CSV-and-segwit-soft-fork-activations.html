        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent email exchange on bitcoin-dev mailing list, John Newbery mentioned that once a consensus change has been activated and buried by sufficient work, the height of that change is considered to be historic fact. However, the exact activation method is no longer of practical interest. This point was elaborated on in a subsequent post, which noted that it's difficult to measure the preferences of economically significant nodes in a decentralized network like Bitcoin.The post also raised the example of segwit activation at height 481,824 and how it's debatable whether that was due to BIP9 version bits signaling, BIP 148 UASF, or a combination of both. The reason this is debatable is because soft-forks are backwards compatible and both BIP9 version bits signaling and BIP 148 UASF had the same basic effect: enforcing segwit. However, the BIP 148 UASF rejected blocks that didn't signal via the BIP9 version bits.It was observed that 100% of known blocks produced after August 1st, 2017 have complied with segwit rules and the BIP9 signaling protocol for segwit. But it's unclear why this happened. It's possible that miners were running the BIP9 signaling Bitcoin Core release or UASF enforcing software, or a combination of both, or entirely different software. Furthermore, there is a question as to why miners were producing segwit-compliant blocks. It is plausible that perhaps they thought the vast majority of economically significant nodes would reject their blocks or they just wanted to enforce segwit. The activation height of a consensus change is considered historic fact once it has been activated and buried by sufficient work, regardless of the exact activation method. In cases where the cause of activation is undecidable, simplifying implementation by hard-coding the activation height can be beneficial. This was done for the 3 ISM soft forks in BIP 90 and for P2SH and segwit script enforcement. The burying of deployments provides benefits such as simplified consensus code and performance and code structure benefits.Recently, Bitcoin Core PR 16060 was merged, which buries the CSV and segwit activation heights to 419328 and 481824 respectively. However, this change could potentially cause a non-backwards compatible change and a chainsplit between pre-0.19 nodes and 0.19 nodes in the event of a re-org below the BIP9 segwit LOCKED_IN height. This would require redoing over 93% of the total work ever committed to Bitcoin mining. While this proposal could theoretically result in a consensus split, it is highly unlikely, and any such circumstances would raise fundamental concerns about the security assumptions of Bitcoin. More details can be found in the 'Considerations' section of BIP 90.The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 90 has been proposed to activate the existing SegWit soft fork on a different timeline. This proposal includes a mandatory activation of SegWit on November 15th, 2018, as well as a hard fork to increase the block weight limit to 2MB eight months later. The proposal aims to address scalability issues and increase transaction throughput while remaining committed to Bitcoin mining. However, any such circumstances would raise fundamental concerns about the security assumptions of Bitcoin. More details can be found in the 'Considerations' section of BIP 90.</p>
