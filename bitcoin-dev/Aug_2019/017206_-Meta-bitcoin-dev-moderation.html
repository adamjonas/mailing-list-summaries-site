    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Emil Engler expressed concerns over the slow moderation process, stating that it takes more than 24 hours for an email to be on the mailing list. The strategy of having moderators in different time zones to cover sleep shifts or other disruptions of service has not been adequate. Jonas Schnelli suggested adding more moderators to shorten the moderation lag, which makes debates cumbersome. Engler also proposed that people who have contributed emails to the mailing list before should not require approval for any future emails (where n is the number of previous emails), but it is unclear whether this feature already exists. However, there is an active software vulnerability that requires moderation to be enabled, and the current version of mailman is unmaintained. Linux Foundation is migrating away from or abandoning the email protocol, making them less willing to do backend infrastructure work. This has resulted in downtime and missing emails that never hit the moderation queue. Despite the challenges with email as a protocol, Bryan shared his contact information for anyone who needs to get in touch.</p>
