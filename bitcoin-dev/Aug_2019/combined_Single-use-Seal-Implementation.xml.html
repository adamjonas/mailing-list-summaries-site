        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bryan Bishop has proposed a practical way to implement Peter Todd's single-use seals concept in a bitcoin-dev mailing list. Single-use seals are like a public key that can only be signed once, and this feature is impossible with mathematics alone but can be implemented using trust or physics-based mechanisms like PoW. The globally unique seal can be closed over a message to create a witness attesting that the seal was closed over that message. A single-use-seal protocol is considered secure if it is impossible to trick the validation function into thinking that a single seal was closed over two different messages.The proposed implementation with Bitcoin defines the seal as a specified txout and the witness as a transaction that spends that txout in a transaction with an OP_RETURN output committing to the hash of the message as the first output. For applications requiring a chain of single-use seals, two txouts for seals can be kept in the wallet and alternated as the chain is extended. A fancier implementation could use a pay-to-pubkey-style commitment, which RGB uses something along these lines.However, Bryan Bishop is hesitant to say that his proposal demonstrated a practical way to implement Peter Todd's single-use seals concept because he thinks Todd would ask for a more sophisticated way to verify seal closure. The context also includes a link to the RGB specifications.</p>
