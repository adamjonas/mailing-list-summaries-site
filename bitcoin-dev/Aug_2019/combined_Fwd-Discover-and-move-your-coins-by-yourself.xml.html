        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Aymeric Vitte has released Phase 3 of the bitcoin-transactions GitHub repository, an open source project financed by NLnet through EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Search and Discovery call. The aim of this project is to provide all necessary tools for anyone to discover and manage their coins, as well as making transactions by themselves without having to sync a full node or as an alternative to wallets. The tool is available for any Bitcoin-based coins and is not restricted to its own wallet.The release includes features like creating transactions, decoding transactions, verifying transactions, converting and mapping addresses, creating and mapping wallets, multisig redeem scripts, pub key and private key mapping, conversion, and formats, and signing and verifying messages. Aymeric Vitte merged former bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets nodejs modules with additional features under a MIT license. The browser version will be a secure standalone offline js webapp inside browsers.This project is not a remake of iancoleman's tool and will extend all existing tools inside one tool with no limitations. It is an alternative to wallets when people don't understand where their coins are. The project includes some features that overlap with iancoleman's tool, as well as other existing tools. Comments/suggestions are welcome.</p>
