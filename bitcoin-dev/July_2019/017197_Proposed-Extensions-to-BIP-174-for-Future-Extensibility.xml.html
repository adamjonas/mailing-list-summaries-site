    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin Development email thread, Dmitry Petukhov suggested that private formats should have at least a basic format with a prefix to distinguish different private formats and avoid unintentional confusion. He proposed that private types can start with the size of the prefix, allowing organizations to choose any prefix they like or no prefix if they are fine with possible conflicts with other empty-prefix private types. However, Andrew disagreed that this should be required and suggested it could be strongly recommended in the BIP itself.Jan Matejek then suggested using Bitcoin compact uint, which most PSBT consumers already implement. But Andrew pointed out a few issues with this approach, including translating poorly to proprietary use types and being malleable as the same value can be represented in many different ways. Despite these issues, he was not opposed to using a CSUint but felt it made things a bit harder and was unnecessary.</p>
