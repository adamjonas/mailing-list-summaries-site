    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to add a "moving checkpoint" to the Bitcoin protocol, which would make the blockchain truly immutable even during a 51% attack. The proposed rule is already implemented in NXT coin and would have nodes ignore any new block under nodeBlockHeight - N, where N is a specified number of blocks. However, concerns have been raised about how this would handle a potential state-sponsored netsplit lasting longer than N. The proposal and potential issues surrounding it are being discussed among members of the Bitcoin-dev community.</p>
