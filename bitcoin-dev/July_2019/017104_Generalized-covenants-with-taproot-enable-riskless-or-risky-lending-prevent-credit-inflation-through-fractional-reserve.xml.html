    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Eric and ZmnSCPxj, Eric is responding to cryptoeconomic principles rather than implementation details. ZmnSCPxj argues that the lifetime of an advertisement is the locked-ness of the UTXO, but Eric challenges this usage of the term "locked" since a UTXO that can be spent at any time is just an unspent output. Eric suggests that there is no actual encumbrance in the proposed design and that early recovery of the UTXO eliminates the value of the time lock cost to the ad market. He also notes that any UTXO is sufficient for the ad network, meaning that unspentness is not actually a necessary cost. Eric further argues that covering the case where one cannot raise the capital to back their ad does not require rental, as the cost of the otherwise rental can just be spent outright. Finally, he suggests that it would be ideal to transfer the value of ad spends to people who present the ads effectively, similar to the AdWords business model.</p>
