    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email conversation, Chris Belcher suggested that alternative forks would require a couple of months to be designed, implemented and deployed. A stronger argument was made regarding wallet library problems such as reused nonces, weak nonces, brainwallets, and weak HD seeds. Sometimes these issues lead directly to theft and loss, but in other cases, the problem is detected by a friendly party and funds can be moved to a secure address before attackers try to exploit it themselves. If funds are timelocked, there is a greater chance the issue will become publicly known and easily exploitable while the funds are inaccessible. It was also noted that Electrum-style indexers don't index more than a certain number of outputs sent to the same address. To fix this, aged coins must not have been sent to a reused address. However, it was pointed out that this wouldn't work as an attacker could send dust to invalidate the bond. To prevent spamming, a different filter type would need to be used that allows filtering by outpoint.</p>
