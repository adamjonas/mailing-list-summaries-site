    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj apologizes for using toxic language in previous replies and acknowledges that additional mechanisms cannot improve efficiency of the base proof-of-stake. Kenshiro's experimental idea to use a formula giving more weight to coins together in a single address is not feasible as expected. However, Kenshiro advocates for standard PoS v3.0 which is considered a "gold standard" in PoS. He also suggests modern techniques like evaluating blockchain density to detect possible attacks could be added to improve security. Kenshiro explains that a 51% history rewrite attack cannot be done in PoS if the attacker doesn't stop creating his 51% of blocks in the main chain to make it shorter than his private fork, and that can be detected. He proposes an emergency protocol where nodes could start ignoring the new fork if they detect a hard fork starting and the main chain has a dangerous low block density between the tip of the blockchain and block N.</p>
