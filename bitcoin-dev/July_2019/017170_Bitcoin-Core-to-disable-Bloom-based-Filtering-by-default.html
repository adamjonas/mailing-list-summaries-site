    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer recommended consulting the Rust implementation of BIP158 for a cleaner structure than Core or Neutrino, which includes server and client side and passes Core's test vectors. Matt Corallo mentioned that the filter-generation code for BIP 157/158 has been in Bitcoin Core for some time, but the P2P serving side of things appears to have lost any champions working on it. He presumed one of the Lightning folks will eventually take care of it, but if needed, it is likely not a ton of work to pipe them through. Justus Ranvier via bitcoin-dev responded by stating that if projects want to adopt BIP-157/158, they need to fix the numerous errors in the specification. As it stands right now, it is impossible to implement the protocol using the specification because the code examples are broken to the point of appearing intentionally sabotaged.</p>
