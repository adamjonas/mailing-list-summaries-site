    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Tamas Blummer and Eric Voskuil discussed the potential value of encumbered coins in Bitcoin. Initially skeptical, Eric later acknowledged one valid use case for such coins: tracking an asset that becomes worthless at a specific time. The encumbered coin can be used to record ownership and trade ownership of the asset during its lifespan. However, Eric argues that this is not a loan in the traditional sense, as there is no usable capital over the term of the rental and no investment possible.Tamas believes that there is value in having an unforgeable register offered by UTXOs that are only temporarily available to their current owner. He argues that coins encumbered with the described covenant represent temporary control of a scarce resource and offer the utility of using the unforgeable register. Eric, on the other hand, argues that for something to become property and have marketable value, it must be both scarce and useful, and above they are only dealing with scarcity, ignoring utility.They also discuss the question of whether covenants are needed at all and if there is actually any value in tracking outputs that cannot be traded for something else. Eric implies that there is no economic value in such tracking, and any fixed-term tracking output represents an expense rather than a loan.Finally, they discuss the assumption of a non-zero dust+1 and how it affects the return on any fixed-term tracking output, given a 10% APR. In this conversation, Tamas Blummer is discussing the value of temporary control and how it only has value if means of dealing with it are offered. He also mentions that final control may not be attainable or too expensive but could potentially provide value in certain situations.The analogy of rental of a consumable good does not apply to non-consumable goods that cannot be traded or consumed. Tamas clarifies that by control, he means the control of entries in the register, which he believes is the deeper utility of Bitcoin. He distinguishes final control as the opposite of temporary control, which is time-limited with some expiry. Eric responds by thanking Tamas for his thoughts and stating that they help sharpen his arguments.</p>
