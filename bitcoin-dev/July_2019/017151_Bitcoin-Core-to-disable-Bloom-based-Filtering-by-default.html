    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list arose about the extra bandwidth used by CFB over bloom filters. It was pointed out that active merchants in impoverished countries paying data rates per MB will not be able to afford CFB, thus cutting them out of Bitcoin entirely. The plan is for these people to rely on custodial services now. However, it was asked how much more bandwidth precisely will CFB require over bloom if someone receives say, 5 tx a day. The conventional wisdom that CFB is privacy-violating was established by a paper which presented mitigations that have seen little exploration. Meanwhile, there are custodial Lightning Network, L-BTC altcoin and massive push into infrastructure for fully custodial accounts.</p>
