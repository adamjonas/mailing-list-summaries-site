    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd discussed the proposed removal of node_bloom. Todd noted that two popular wallets, Andreas' Android Bitcoin wallet and BRD, are significant users of node_bloom. He argued that privacy is a matter of individual choice in the current protocol and suggested that people should be allowed to provide this network service if they so choose. Todd also mentioned that there isn't much network security obtained by having a large quantity of people following the Bitcoin headers based on the longest weighted chain, as the network is subject to sybil attacks. He stated that creating services that are vulnerable to sybil attacks encourages them, which creates its own risks. The patch would still allow users to provide bloom filtering services if they set -peerbloomfilters=1.</p>
