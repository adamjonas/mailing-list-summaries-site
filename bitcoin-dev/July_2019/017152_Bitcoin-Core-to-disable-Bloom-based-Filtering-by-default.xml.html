    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 22, 2019, Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev mentioned that the filter-generation code for BIP 157/158 has been in Bitcoin Core for some time. However, the P2P serving side of things appears to have lost any champions working on it. Corallo presumes that one of the Lightning folks will eventually take over this issue, as they are requiring their users to connect to a handful of their own servers right now. He also suggests that if someone really needs it, it is likely not a ton of work to pipe them through.However, there is an issue with the implementation of BIP-157/158 protocol. It is impossible to implement the protocol using the specification because the code examples are broken to the point of appearing intentionally sabotaged. In order for projects to adopt BIP-157/158, the numerous errors in the specification need to be fixed. The email also includes two attachments - one named "0x9B2D74E2A30A85B9.asc" which is of type application/pgp-keys and has a size of 29350 bytes, and another named "signature.asc" which is of type application/pgp-signature and has a size of 833 bytes.</p>
