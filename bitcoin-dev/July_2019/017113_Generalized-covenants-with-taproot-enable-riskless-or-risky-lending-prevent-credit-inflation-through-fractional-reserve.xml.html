    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj proposes a "Bitcoin Classified Ads Network" where nodes in the network gossip advertisements referring to an unspent transaction output (UTXO) that must contain a commitment to the text of the advertisement. Nodes have a maximum limit on the total size of all advertisements they retain and propagate and will sort advertisements according to a value-rate if exceeded. Sellers will attempt to put the minimum possible value into a UTXO committing to an advertisement, paying rent to joinmarket makers and LN forwarding nodes. The minimal-value UTXO is kept unspent, which involves an opportunity cost as it may have been used elsewhere. If competitors exist and the node storage is already filled, the minimum value of a UTXO that can keep an advertisement alive on BCAN will approach the expected gain from selling the product. A HODLer may offer to provide a UTXO locked by a 2-of-2 with a commitment to an advertisement of the advertiser's choosing, in exchange for rent of the value, plus an unbreakable promise to return the rented UTXO value back to the HODLer. Users can look for advertisements of specific classes by querying their own BCAN node, maintaining privacy. The proposed system extracts value from sellers wishing to advertise to avoid spamming the BCAN.</p>
