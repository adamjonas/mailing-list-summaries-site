    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Bodt from France has proposed a Bitcoin protocol improvement to add a "request/reply id" field in all messages. This would help in implementing robust blockchain downloading as it would provide context information. The idea is to add a new "requestid" field in messages and define rules based on the message type. This would permit better asynchronous messaging and could be useful for getblocks/getdata/getheaders and future messages. Christian has already implemented a prototype of this proposal, which can be found here. He suggests that this could allow the removal of "hashContinue" in a second step. He is discussing this proposal as he read the PONG BIP and saw some similar nonce field added and was not sure if this nonce field would still be required if they had request/reply ids.</p>
