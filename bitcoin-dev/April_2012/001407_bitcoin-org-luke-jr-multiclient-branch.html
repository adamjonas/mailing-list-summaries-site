    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is centered around a request to pull from Github a project that has been there for almost 20 days. The author suggests that the project be pulled right away and improvements can follow, as an anti-pattern of debating trivial issues could arise. A suggestion is made by Mike Hearn to have four columns and X rows for each box, with linkable titles, pictures and an 850-word blurb from the project, citing libbitcoin as an example of a circular peg that would not fit in the square boxes of this table. The author expresses happiness in seeing MultiBit, Electrum and Armory get exposure. The post concludes with an invitation for anyone interested to add a specific IP address to their hosts file and navigate to <a href="http://bitcoin.org">http://bitcoin.org</a>.</p>
