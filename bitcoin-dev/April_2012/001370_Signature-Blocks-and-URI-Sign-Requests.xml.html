    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alan Reiner expressed his concern regarding the usage of P2SH and multi-sig technology in Bitcoin transactions. He believes that the greatest barrier to using multi-sig is the ability to execute them in less than 14 steps, therefore BIP 10 (or successor) is critical to the success of multi-sig. Wladimir responded with a proposal about signing preformatted messages from sites to make financial transactions more secure, which restricts the scope to avoid dealing with MIME headers, html, or embedded images. Wladimir suggested using the "request signing" bitcoin URL to reduce copy/pasting, but also mentioned the URL size limit and proposed a solution to pass the address where the message can be retrieved. He compared this proposal to the CSR, which has different functionality and goal. Wladimir emphasized writing down use-cases in which this makes P2SH easier and less involved, and also pointed out the need for a BIP to define URL signing/authentication itself.</p>
