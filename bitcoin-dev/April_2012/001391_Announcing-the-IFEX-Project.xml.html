    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A project called XChange has been created to provide a unified API for applications to access financial exchanges. Currently, it supports Bitcoin exchanges such as MtGox and Intersango, with plans to expand to others. The project is still in early development stages but may be integrated into the MultiBit Bitcoin client in the future. One of the challenges faced by the XChange team is that each exchange uses its own data model and protocol, so providing a reference implementation of how an exchange should publish its data would be helpful. In addition, the Internet Financial EXchange (IFEX) Project seeks to enhance interoperability between financial settlement systems of all types, including emerging digital currencies and alternative financial communities. The IFEX Protocol is a work in progress that aims to bridge the gap between conventional financial systems, emerging digital currencies, alternative financial communities, and financial service providers by providing a standard protocol for transaction and settlement path negotiation with arbitrary financial instruments, currencies or assets. The hope is to move towards an open source implementation of the IFEX protocol that interoperates with major and emerging settlement networks.</p>
