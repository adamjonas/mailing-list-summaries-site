        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The speaker in this context is suggesting that a specific function within software development should have an assert as its initial check. The reason for this recommendation is due to the potential problem that could arise if the function is called a coinbase tx. It is unclear who the speaker is addressing or what the exact nature of the conversation entails. However, it can be inferred that the discussion relates to technical aspects of software development, given the use of terms such as "function" and "assert". Without further information on the function being discussed, it is difficult to understand the full implications of the speaker's suggestion. More details are needed to provide a clear understanding of how the assert would address the issue with coinbase tx and how it would affect the overall functionality of the software.</p>
