    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki, a developer, has created a new bitcoin.org clients page. The order of the lists he added are: Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Electrum and MultiBit. He suggested trying CTRL-F5 to force a browser refresh if the list does not appear. Taaki did not copy the Armory description from the website because it sounded too spammy like a sales pitch. For each client, Taaki tried to emphasize a 'theme'. Bitcoin-Qt is stability. Armory is advanced. Electrum is convenient. MultiBit is ease of use. Alan Reiner replied to Taaki thanking him for creating the new page and stating that he likes the layout and design. However, he made a couple comments regarding the entries for "wallet security" and "backups". Reiner did not think they accurately describe Armory as the wallet security should say "Encrypt/Offline" and backups should say something like "One-time Printable". Reiner also thinks Bitcoin-Qt should still go first as it is the "reference" client and the one with the most quality control and stability.</p>
