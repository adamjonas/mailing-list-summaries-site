    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki and Jeff were discussing a proposed change to the protocol that would rely on the server to track a piece of information. However, the proposed change was more about distinguishing between replies and spontaneous notifications of the other peer, with all state still being tracked locally on the client side. Amir did not understand why Jeff thought the proposal would make the protocol more stateful, as each reply was only the result of the current request and there was no new session information. The proposed change did not directly improve on peers that do not answer requests, but rather enabled this to be done easily in a secondary step, which could only be implemented when all peers on the network were running the modified code.</p>
