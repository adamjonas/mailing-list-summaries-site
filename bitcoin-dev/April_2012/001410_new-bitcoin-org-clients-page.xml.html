    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Alan and Amir Taaki, Alan comments on the layout and design of a Bitcoin client list on Github. He expresses his satisfaction with the alphabetical sorting of the entries but suggests that the descriptions for "wallet security" and "backups" do not accurately describe Armory. Alan recommends that the "Wallet Security" entry should mention something about "Encrypt/Offline" to reflect the offline wallets feature of Armory. Similarly, he suggests that the "Backups" entry should mention "one-time printable" if it fits within the box. Despite his pleasure in being listed first on the Github list, Alan opines that Bitcoin-Qt should still go first because it is the "reference" client, the de-facto client for most users, and the one with the most quality control and stability.</p>
