    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email proposes two related things. The first is the idea of Signature Blocks, which is a more versatile and robust message-signing exchange. It has been implemented in Armory (as of v0.55), and is an expansion on the idea of BIP 10. A signature block is a human-readable chunk of data that immediately identifies the address and message being signed. The verification process includes checking that the public key matches the address field, verifying that the signature matches the included message for this public key, and ensuring that the message is properly formatted with a standardized character set and escape/replacement scheme for things like newlines or double-quotes. The second proposal is the Sign-Message URI scheme, which allows for requesting signed messages from users using URIs. The idea is to use the first funding address to identify the owner of an account, with all account maintenance done through signed messages with this address. The URI scheme would add a few parameters to the scheme and further replacement rules to handle messages properly. The general CONOPs include navigating to "Withdraw funds" on a webpage, filling in details, producing a clickable URI link that loads the information into the client, asking for confirmation and passphrase (if necessary), then producing a signature (and sig block if necessary). The extra tags needed would be "*requestSig*=True", "*sigNeeded*=1Qjf3392k31h", "*message*=Please%20withdraw%2012.3%20BTC%20to%20addr%201Hfr3jk2093f", and "*replyurl*=<a href="http://requestor.com/sig_replies.asp?">http://requestor.com/sig_replies.asp?</a>".</p>
