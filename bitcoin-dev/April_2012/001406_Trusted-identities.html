    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion on the Bitcoin network's implementation of replacement transactions. Peter Todd asked about the current status of this feature, to which Alan replied that it was completely disabled. The discussion then moves on to how transactions with lock-time in the future and non-maximum sequence number will be accepted into nodes' memory pools but will not go into any block until locktime expires. However, the actual "replacement" mechanism is disabled, meaning that although nodes accept the transaction as if it's replaceable, they don't allow it to be replaced, except for one time by injecting a final transaction into the blockchain. This requires a miner to agree to remove the non-final transaction from their memory pool and specifically include the replacement.</p>
