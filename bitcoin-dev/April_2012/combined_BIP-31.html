        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on April 11, 2012, Luke-Jr and Mike Hearn debated the implementation of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for the pong message. Mike shared a link to BIP 0031 on the en.bitcoin.it wiki, which outlined rules for handling the pong message. However, Luke-Jr had previously suggested using protocol version bump 60001 instead. In reference to this, Pull #1081 was mentioned as making some revisions along these lines.On the same day, Mike Hearn emailed Jeff Garzik about the BIP for the pong message. The email included a link to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) wiki page. Although the exact context of the message is unclear, it seems that there was a discussion regarding the protocol version bump, specifically whether to adopt the value 60001.Jeff requested a BIP related to the pong message, and the provided link directed to the Bitcoin Wiki, where BIP 0031 was described in detail. This proposal outlined specific rules for handling the pong message, which serves to check if a connection between two nodes is still active. The BIP included comprehensive technical specifications and guidelines for implementing these rules. Adhering to these standards ensures compatibility among Bitcoin implementations, ultimately enhancing the network's overall quality and reliability.</p>
