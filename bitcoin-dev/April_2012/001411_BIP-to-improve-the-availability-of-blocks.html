    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum discussion on SourceForge, Rebroad proposed adding hash advertisements in the header of a block, which would help nodes determine if they want to reject a download. This proposal could aid in saving bandwidth among behaving nodes. Rebroad also suggested modifying existing methods or adding a new method to allow nodes to request upload and download partially downloaded blocks. This would help nodes obtain the blockchain who have restrictive ISPs, especially if they are being served on port 80 or 443. Another option for those with slow or restrictive internet is to run a lightweight node like Electrum. However, Wladimir pointed out that even with partial blocks, the download will still be substantial.</p>
