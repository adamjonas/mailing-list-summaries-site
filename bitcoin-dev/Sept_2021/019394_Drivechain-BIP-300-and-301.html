    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article compares Liquid and Lightning, focusing on the trust model and on-ramps/off-ramps. Additionally, the security of Bitcoin and expected fees on layer 1 due to Drivechain are discussed. A Medium post compares similarities and differences between RSK and Ethereum. A video by Paul Sztorc discusses fees in relation to LN, Liquid, and Rootstock, while a question on Bitcoin Stackexchange asks about Bitcoin transactions with layer 2 projects. Two critiques of Drivechain are mentioned on the project website, but the author disagrees with some points. The author prefers discussing these topics on a forum rather than Twitter to avoid misinformation. The author encourages sidechain projects and is interested in learning more about Drivechain. In the slides from a YouTube video, a website is misleading as it misrepresents the number of blocks mined and uses Coinmetrics API to support this claim. The article concludes by mentioning improvements that affect fees such as Segwit, Layer 2, Batching, UTXO consolidation, Fee estimation, Coin selection, Exchanges, Wallets, etc.</p>
