    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Braidpool is viewed as an improvement to P2Pool in terms of making a peer-to-peer pool work on a larger scale. In contrast, Stratum v2 brings many engineering improvements to centralized pools. However, the pool still controls both accepting a proposed block and refusing payouts. Centralized pools that use PPLNS are opaque, making it difficult for smaller miners to view shares received by the pool and ensure fair reward calculation. Braidpool offers transparent views of shares received by the pool, which allow miners to verify reward calculations even with a PPLNS-like scheme. It also offers payouts over a one-way channel, so miner rewards do not consume block space, unlike P2Pool. Additionally, using the transparent view of shares, delivery of such shares can be built to market makers providing futures contracts for hashrate, which is impossible with opaque centralized pools. Braidpool prepares for future attacks on centralized mining pools while attracting miners to the platform now.</p>
