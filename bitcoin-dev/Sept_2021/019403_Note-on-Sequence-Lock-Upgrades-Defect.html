    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy highlighted a flaw in the Sequence lock implementation with respect to upgradability. He explained that this might be protected against by some transaction level policy but he couldn't find any in policy.cpp. To address this issue, he proposed a patch in his blog post. In response to this, David A. Harding asked whether this is the reason why BIP68 requires using tx.version=2 and suggested deploying any new nSequence rules with tx.version>2. BIP 68 specifies that transactions with an nVersion greater than or equal to 2 define the meaning of sequence numbers for which the rest of the specification relies on. On the other hand, BIP-112 says not (txTo->nVersion), implying that transactions with a version less than 2 are not supported.</p>
