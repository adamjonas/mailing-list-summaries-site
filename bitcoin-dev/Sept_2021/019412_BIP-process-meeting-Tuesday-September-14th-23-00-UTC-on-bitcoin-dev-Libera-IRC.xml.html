    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process is undergoing a review to determine if it can be improved, or at least inform why certain things operate the way they do. Two IRC meetings have been organized for September 14th and September 29th on the Libera IRC channel #bitcoin-dev to discuss possible topics ranging from relatively mundane issues such as spelling changes to more controversial ones such as the role of BIPs in informing the community of soft fork activation parameters. Participants are encouraged to address common misunderstandings and subtleties of the process. The meetings are being organized in the spirit of improving a resource that the community all relies on. A BIP process wishlist has already been created and contributors are invited to attend the meetings to make progress. The current BIP process is outlined in BIP 2.</p>
