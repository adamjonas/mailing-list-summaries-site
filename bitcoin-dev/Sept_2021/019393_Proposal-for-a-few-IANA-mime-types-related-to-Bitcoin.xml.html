    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter D. Gray proposed to register new MIME types with the IANA, including bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri. However, Andrew Chow expressed doubts about the feasibility of registering these MIME types due to the limited number of accepted top-level types and the requirements for registration in the Standards tree. In response, Peter suggested ignoring the IANA and instead declaring useful "mime types" in a new BIP that can be agreed upon within the Bitcoin community. Maxim Orlovsky from LNP/BP Standards Association expressed willingness to write the draft of the proposed BIP since he was planning to propose something similar before. Andrew shared his knowledge on MIME types and their registration process, highlighting the limitations on top-level types and the need for recognized standards organizations or an RFC for registration in the Standards tree. He also mentioned that using the Vendor tree would result in a prefix of "vnd." in the MIME type name, which he considered unreasonable. Peter acknowledged Andrew's concerns and suggested writing an independent submission RFC for the proposed MIME types.Peter provided details on the proposed MIME types, including their descriptions and potential uses. He also indicated that they could be useful beyond web servers, such as in NFC (NDEF records) where shorter length is critical. He noted that while some MIME types were proposed in BIP-71, they were unrelated to the proposed ones and were never registered. In conclusion, Peter proposed new MIME types for Bitcoin-related content, and while there were concerns about the registration process, a new BIP will be drafted to declare these useful "mime types" and agree upon their usage within the Bitcoin community.</p>
