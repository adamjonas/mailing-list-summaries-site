        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the potential use cases for introducing new technology, such as ByteWords and fountain codes, in the context of codes. CBOR is considered to be the best option in this regard. The UR encoded version of PSBTs is gaining popularity among wallet companies due to its ability to enable better QR and Airgap solutions while leveraging CBOR, which is an IETF standard.A community of Airgap wallet developers can be found at <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community,">https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community,</a> with libraries available at <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons</a>#urs. It is suggested that UR should be registered as well, possibly as bitcoin/psbt+ur.Peter D.Gray has proposed several MIME media types, including bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri, to be registered with the IANA. While these may be useful for web servers and other purposes, their approval by IANA remains uncertain. The article also explores using optional parameters to indicate base64 or hex encoding and the usefulness of these types in NFC (NDEF records), where shorter length is critical.In response to this proposal, doubts were raised about the feasibility of registering these MIME types due to the limited number of accepted top-level types and the requirements for registration in the Standards tree. Peter suggested ignoring the IANA and instead declaring useful "mime types" in a new BIP that can be agreed upon within the Bitcoin community.However, Andrew Chow noted that he attempted to register "application/bitcoin-psbt" in 2019 but it was not accepted. There are only a few accepted top-level types, and "bitcoin" cannot be used as the top-level type unless an RFC is submitted to add a "bitcoin" top-level.Christopher Allen notes that many wallet companies are now supporting the UR encoded version of PSBTs, which allows for better QR & Airgap solutions, and also leverages CBOR which is an IETF standard. The Blockchain Commons is encouraging the registration of bitcoin/psbt+ur, which would support the UR encoded version of PSBTs.Lastly, the author proposes registering three new MIME media types with IANA under RFC 2046: bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri. The bitcoin/psbt media type refers to a BIP-174 file in binary format, which makes no claims about signed or unsigned status. The bitcoin/txn media type refers to a wire-ready fully-signed transaction in binary format. Lastly, the bitcoin/uri media type refers to BIP-21, which can encode amounts and comments in URL arguments and could be used as a response to 402 - Payment required.In conclusion, Peter proposed new MIME types for Bitcoin-related content, and while there were concerns about the registration process, a new BIP will be drafted to declare these useful "mime types" and agree upon their usage within the Bitcoin community. The article highlights the importance of considering the best technology options for codes, particularly in the context of improving QR and Airgap solutions, and the potential benefits of registering new MIME media types with the IANA.</p>
