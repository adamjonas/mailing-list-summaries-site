    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin development community is discussing the frequency and depth of reorganizations (reorgs) on the Signet network, which is used for testing new features before they are implemented on the main Bitcoin network. Reorgs occur when a branch of the blockchain with more proof-of-work overtakes the current main branch, causing some transactions to be invalidated. One suggestion is to have three reorgs per day, each 48 blocks apart, to allow developers in all time zones to participate in testing. However, too frequent reorgs could hinder other Signet users, so it's important to find a balance. The suggested maximum depth for reorgs ranges from 6 blocks for routine testing to over 2000 blocks for severe bugs that require large changes to the UTXO set. In addition, there is a concern about nodes that reject higher work chains or double-spending transactions across two chains, which could potentially partition the peer-to-peer network. A quick draft of code for "-signetacceptreorg=0" has been made available to address this issue.</p>
