    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pool2win, a peer-to-peer mining pool, has proposed a decentralized solution to the problems faced by P2Pool. The proposal aims to provide lower variance for smaller miners, even when large miners join the pool. Miners build their own blocks, and payouts require a constant size block space, independent of the number of miners in the pool. The pool also provides building blocks for enabling a futures market of hash rates. The proposed solution uses a DAG of shares replicated at all miners, which is then used to compute rewards for miners. Rewards are paid out using one-way payment channels by an anonymous hub communicating with the miners using Tor's hidden services. This construction ensures that neither the hub nor the miners can cheat. The full proposal and details on trading hash rate can be found on the Pool2win GitHub page. Comparisons to Stratum v2 were not provided in the context.</p>
