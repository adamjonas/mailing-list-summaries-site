        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mike Rosset, a developer, reached out to the bitcoin-dev mailing list for assistance with inconsistencies he encountered while experimenting with Bitcoin using GNU Guile Scheme. He had created a toy Bitcoin miner and was trying to generate templates for the Merkle root by concatenating transactions data. However, he faced difficulty in creating the coinbase transaction as the json cointbasetxn field was missing in getblocktemplate.In his request for help, Mike shared a test template response data and a modified version of the merkle python reference script from the Bitcoin wiki page. Although he was able to replicate a Merkle root hash (c5fff939f628a04428c080ed5bd7cd9bc0b4722b2522743049adb18213adf28a), it didn't include the coinbase transaction.Mike, who had recently developed an interest in the bitcoin protocol, had been using GNU Guile Scheme to experiment with it. However, he found inconsistencies in the documentation provided on <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate</a> regarding the creation of the Merkle root using templates. According to his understanding, the coinbase transaction should have the transactions data concatenated before generating the Merkle root. However, since getblocktemplate lacked the json cointbasetxn field, he was uncertain how to create a coinbase transaction without it.To resolve this issue, Mike sought guidance in acquiring the coinbase transaction and ensuring that the Merkle roots generated by his Python and Guile implementations matched. He wanted to sanitize his process in Guile by incorporating a coinbase transaction, thus aligning it with the Python implementation.Overall, Mike's objective was to replicate the Merkle root hash (c5fff939f628a04428c080ed5bd7cd9bc0b4722b2522743049adb18213adf28a) using the test data in Guile, while also ensuring that the coinbase transaction was included and that both the Python and Guile Merkle roots matched.</p>
