    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message has recently worked on a python implementation of bitcoin signature messages and found that there was better documentation available for Segwit signature message than Taproot. They suggest that Taproot should have its own BIP for signature message, just like Segwit, as it is currently defined in BIP 341 while the test vectors are in a different BIP. Additionally, the test vectors for Taproot lack documentation and are not atomic, creating problems for signature verification since it is difficult to debug where something went wrong. On the other hand, BIP 143 provides hash preimages, making debugging easier and faster for Segwit signature hash function. The author offers to write the test cases if their idea is accepted. Finally, they apologize for any mistakes made in their language as English is not their first language and this is their first contribution to Bitcoin.</p>
