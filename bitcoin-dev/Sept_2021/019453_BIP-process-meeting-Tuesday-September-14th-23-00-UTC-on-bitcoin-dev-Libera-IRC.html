    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Prayank suggests a few things regarding the BIP process. He explains that a BIP is created by following a process which includes planning and documenting a proposal, opening a PR in the bitcoin/bips repository, assigning a number to it and sharing it on the bitcoin dev mailing list. Each BIP is implemented differently and opinions on proposals differ as well. Prayank proposes the creation of a bot in the bitcoin/bips repository that notifies about pull requests based on different things, which will help maintainers and contributors. Additionally, he shares his experience in creating a BIP Gallery to help newbies understand the importance of BIPs in Bitcoin, but couldn't complete it due to lack of interest. He suggests adding text and improving the image gallery for better results.</p>
