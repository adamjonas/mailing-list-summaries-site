    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Prayank proposed an exercise to introduce vulnerabilities in various important Bitcoin projects and see how the maintainers and reviewers respond. The exercise will involve creating new GitHub accounts and studying issues in several Bitcoin projects such as Bitcoin Core, LND, Libraries, Bisq, Wallets, etc. Prayank plans to prepare pull requests to introduce some vulnerability by fixing one of these issues and document the responses. He will share the results later on. Additionally, x00 will assist Prayank in this exercise. x00 is a penetration tester with experience working for a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange to manage their security. Prayank will ensure that nothing is merged that affects the security of any Bitcoin project. Prayank also invites others to suggest more projects to include in this exercise. There are no fixed dates for completion; however, all PRs will be created within a span of a few days. Prayank plans to complete the exercise within the next six months.</p>
