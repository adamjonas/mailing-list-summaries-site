    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Michael Folkson expressed his confusion about the motivation behind public signet. As a developer of Bitcoin applications, he believed he was part of the target market for public signet, yet he saw no benefit to using it over testnet3 or mainnet testing. This is due to the slow and irregular block discovery times on testnet3, which can cause significant delays in testing. However, on mainnet, block discovery times are more consistent and predictable. Folkson argued that while blocks being too fast is not generally an issue, there could be improvements made to make public signet a better platform for testing. He questioned why these improvements had not been implemented yet. Overall, the conversation highlighted the challenges and limitations of existing testing platforms for Bitcoin developers and the need for continued innovation in this area.</p>
