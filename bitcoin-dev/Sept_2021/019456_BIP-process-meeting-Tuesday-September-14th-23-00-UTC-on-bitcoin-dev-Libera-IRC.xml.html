    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list talks about ways to improve the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. Prayank suggested that a BIP is nothing but a proposal shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and anyone can create BIP directories. They proposed documenting a proposal, opening a pull request on the bitcoin/bips repository, assigning a number and merging it before sharing the proposal on the mailing list. Michael suggests that using Git version control system in the repository will make it easier to go through multiple edits and revisions than a static mailing list. He also suggests using bots in the repository to notify maintainers and contributors of pull requests based on different things. Additionally, he recommends creating a BIP Gallery with text and image galleries to encourage more people to engage with the BIP process. The discussion also includes points about the perception of authority, the use of same organization on GitHub misleading for many, and the importance of ACKs/NACKs in discussions related to proposals. Ultimately, the goal is to provide clarity and build better software while maintaining the status quo.</p>
