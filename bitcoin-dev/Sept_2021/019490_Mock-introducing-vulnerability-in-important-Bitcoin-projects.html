    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post on Bitcoin Stackexchange, it was suggested that some companies may attempt to hire developers to introduce backdoors in Bitcoin Core. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it prompted one developer to consider the possibility and prepare for such scenarios. The developer proposes creating new GitHub accounts and studying issues in various important Bitcoin projects, including Bitcoin Core, LND, Libraries, Bisq, and Wallets. They plan to prepare pull requests that introduce vulnerabilities by fixing one of these issues and document how maintainers and reviewers respond. The results will be shared after a few days. The developer is seeking feedback on whether this approach is appropriate or if there are better ways to prepare for potential threats.</p>
