    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, with suggestions for improving the BIP process and documentation. One suggestion is to use Git version control system instead of relying solely on the mailing list for editing and revision. Another suggestion is to create a BIP directory that links to the proposals shared on the mailing list, which can be updated without changing the original post. The idea of having a central repository for BIPs is not a concern for some, as there are limits on the ability of BIP editors to unilaterally merge in contentious code changes. A bot in the bitcoin/bips repository that notifies about pull requests based on different things could help maintainers and contributors. A previous attempt at creating a BIP Gallery was made but was not considered helpful by many. However, an informational BIP could supplement the standard BIP for new implementers or casual readers.</p>
