    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Karl-Johan Alm proposed that changes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be done as BIP extensions. BIPs are proposals that begin as ideas and are formulated and discussed on the bitcoin-dev list before being turned into pull requests to the bips repository, assigned a BIP number by the editors, and merged. Alm believes that by making extensions to BIPs rather than modifying them long after review, the community is given assurances that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever and the ability to judge modifications to BIPs on their merits alone. Additionally, the path to propose modifications to BIPs is provided even if their authors have gone inactive and cease to provide feedback. Federico Berrone replied to Alm's proposal, agreeing with it and suggesting that additional information can be added in a separate piece to de-clutter BIPs and make proposals more understandable without modifying the original proposal.</p>
