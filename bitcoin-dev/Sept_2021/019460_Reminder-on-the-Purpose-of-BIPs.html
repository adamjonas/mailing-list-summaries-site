    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a recent meeting, the suggestion to decentralize the BIPs process was made, as it has been 12 years since Bitcoin's inception and only four people showed up to discuss changes. The proposal was to create multiple BIP directories, reducing dependency on one repository or few people. While documentation is important, implementation is more so, and there are many ways to document things online. An example was created to demonstrate this point. Bitcoin is not just another open source software; it is a protocol for decentralized networks used to settle payments. As such, it is being redefined by cypherpunks, activists, hacktivists, privacy advocates, and others in an attempt to separate money from state. Therefore, anything can happen in the future, and preparation is key.</p>
