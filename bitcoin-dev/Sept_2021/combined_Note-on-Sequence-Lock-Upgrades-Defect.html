        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A flaw in the Sequence lock implementation regarding upgradability was recently discovered by Jeremy Rubin, a member of the Bitcoin Dev community. He proposed a patch to fix the issue and suggested widely surveying the community before making any changes to ensure that no one is depending on the current semantics in any live application. Meanwhile, Dave suggested using tx.version=2 and deploying new nSequence rules with tx.version>2 to resolve the problem.In addition to this, there was a recent discussion among Bitcoin developers about sequence values used by wallet implementations. The discussion focused on whether any other numbers besides 0xfffffffd are currently expected by any wallet software to be broadcastable with the DISABLE flag set. This conversation prompted Jeremy Rubin to propose a patch for the issue on GitHub.Jeremy also proposed a patch to fix the flaw in the Sequence lock implementation with respect to upgradability. He suggests introducing a new field to signal policy through p2p packages to address the problem of separating mempool policies signaling from consensus data. However, he notes that this could be vulnerable to tampering by malicious peers. Antoine Riard agreed on the general principle to not blur mempool policies signaling in committed transaction data and suggested introducing a new field to signal policy within p2p packages.Antoine further talked about flag day activation to smooth policy deployment, where he distinguished between three types of policy deployments: loosening changes, tightening changes, and new feature introductions. Regarding SEQUENCE_ROOT_TYPE::UNCHECKED_METADATA, it is a special type of metadata required for the counterparty to efficiently respond to a unilateral channel closure. It obscures the number of commitments made on the channel, yet still provides a useful index for both nodes.By introducing new discouragement waivers, e.g not rejecting the usage of the top 8 bits, they're moving away from the policy design principle they're trying to establish (separation of mempool policies signaling from consensus data). Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the best approach to avoid compromising the security of the system.</p>
