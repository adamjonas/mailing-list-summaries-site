    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Prayank proposed an exercise to study vulnerabilities in different important Bitcoin projects. The proposal was met with caution by Ruben Somsen, who suggested that Prayank ensure his plan is welcomed by contributors before proceeding. In response to Prayank's proposal, ZmnSCPxj suggested that he hash the name of the new GitHub accounts for the exercise and post it along with some randomized salt as a standard precommitment. However, ZmnSCPxj also advised Prayank to tread carefully as his proposal could come at the expense of existing open source contributors and cause them a lot of work in order to gather the data he's interested in. ZmnSCPxj also referenced a related event in the Linux community that did not go over well, which can be found using the links provided in the email. Prayank's original proposal involved creating new GitHub accounts for the exercise, studying issues in different important Bitcoin projects including Bitcoin Core, LND, Libraries, Bisq, Wallets, etc., preparing pull requests to introduce some vulnerability by fixing one of these issues, seeing how maintainers and reviewers respond to this, and documenting the results. Prayank also mentioned that x00 would help him in this exercise.</p>
