    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed changes to BIP 174 include moving redeemScripts, witnessScripts, and BIP 32 derivation paths to per-input and per-output data. This will make the format easier to read and simpler for signers to parse. Additionally, a plain pubkey can still be put in a BIP 32 derivation path field where the value is just the fingerprint of the pubkey itself. By having the redeemScript and witnessScript readily available in the input, signers do not need to construct a map to find them. The finalized scriptSig and finalized scriptWitness fields have also been added to ensure that unsigned transactions are the same for two PSBTs with data for the same tx. The sighash type field will now be a requirement instead of a recommendation, and signatures must use the specified sighash type for that input. PSBTs should either be in binary or encoded as a Base64 string. A draft of the revised BIP can be found at the provided link. If these changes are satisfactory, a PR will be opened to the BIPs repo to update the BIP, and test vectors will be created and updated.</p>
