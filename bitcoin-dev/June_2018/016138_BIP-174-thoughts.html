    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille suggested some ideas related to BIP 174 (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Format). He was unsure about the extent of implementation of the BIP and asked for feedback. One of the suggestions was generic key offset derivation, which supports pay-to-contract derivations, is more flexible, efficient, and compact, but it requires signer support. Another suggestion was using hex encoding, which may not be suitable for large PSBTs. Jonas Schnelli proposed a single child key or keypath as sufficient for HWW to derive the relevant key without creating lookup-windows or other maps. Pieter disagreed as there may be other times that multiple derivation paths and master keys are required. Jonas also questioned whether there would be more per-output data and suggested an output section. There was a disagreement on whether sighash type 0x03 should be binding or not, with Pieter stating it is up to the signer to decide what they wish to sign. There was also a discussion on skipping unknown types and introducing a flag to define if the record is "optional." The goal is to keep the format relatively clear while avoiding duplication of data. Size is not a constraint, but unnecessary large size should be avoided as PSBT still has to be transmitted to other people.</p>
