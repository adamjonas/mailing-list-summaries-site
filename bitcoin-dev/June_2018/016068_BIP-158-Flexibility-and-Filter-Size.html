    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer, a Bitcoin expert, has conducted an analysis on the use of filters in Bitcoin history. Using filters with P=19 M=784931, he found that the output script and spent script filters developed by Wuille's (b) have sizes of approximately 0.2% of block size. Furthermore, these filters are roughly 10% smaller than output script and spent outpoint filters created by Wuille's (a). However, savings from using these filters have been trending lower over the years. Blummer provided graphs to support his findings. It should be noted that there was a correction made to the original statement, stating that the sizes of Wuille's (b) filters were actually around 2% of block size rather than 0.2%.</p>
