    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer agrees with matejcikâ€™s first three points and especially the fourth point about using a mandatory or optional flag. They argue that while the standard is designed to be space-conservative, they believe that clarity and ease of use should take priority over size constraints. The writer questions the need for such space conservation, as the format isn't intended for blockchain or persistent storage where size would matter more. The writer also notes that Hardware Wallets (HWWs) may not handle Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PBST) natively since it's not optimized for presenting various information in signing-verification. Additionally, HWWs often come with very restrictive RAM constraints, and a single stream-in of a PSBT through USB or a similar channel may not work in many cases.Finally, the writer suggests that registering or defining a mime-type for PSBT would be an excellent usability feature. This would allow users to send PSBT by email/messenger and open them easily by double-clicking on them.</p>
