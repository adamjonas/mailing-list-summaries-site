    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, Andrea proposed removing "global types" from the revised specification. However, Andrew disagreed with the idea and stated that it is better to keep it there as it would be less of a breaking change and allow future extensibility. Additionally, there may be a point in the future where global types would be useful/necessary. On the topic of encoding, William Casarin suggested having a human-readable part like lightning invoices, but Andrew did not think it was necessary. Peter D. Gray suggested using hex for developers and JSON interfaces instead of specifying an encoding. Andrew believed that PSBTs will primarily be strings that people copy and paste, and base64 encoding would make the strings smaller. Finally, Peter gave feedback on the BIP, suggesting defining symbols for numeric key values and reformatting tables, which Andrew agreed to address.</p>
