    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 is undergoing proposed changes that have sparked a debate. The issue at hand is whether conflicting values for the same key should be considered invalid. Some argue that implementing such an approach is unnecessary and could cause wallets to stop supporting BIP 174. The current email thread was meant for improving the existing BIP, not designing a new one. One member suggested using protobuf as a standard format for parsing BIP174 during a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The member acknowledged that it would involve more work than using a custom hand-parsed format, but argued that having a well-described and widely-implemented format would be worthwhile. They also pointed out that there are protobuf implementations available for every conceivable platform, whereas a custom parser would require writing a lot of code from scratch. Furthermore, the member noted that it is possible to modify a hand-written parser to do the necessary checks at the parser level without breaking the format. In their opinion, the choice is between protobuf and a custom key-value format, and even a hand-parsable key-value format could be implemented in terms of protobuf. To clarify the confusion surrounding the proposed changes, it was suggested that the Combiner algorithm operate independently by a separate agent, such as a network node. Matejcik opened a pull request containing changes he proposed earlier. However, some argue that making drastic changes to the BIP can cause wallets to stop supporting it. As such, the implementation of conflicting values for the same key may not be necessary.</p>
