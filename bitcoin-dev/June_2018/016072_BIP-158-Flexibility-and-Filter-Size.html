    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>less data) ways to prove that a certain output exists, but there aresecurity concerns around using outpoints as well. On the other hand,prev script is considered secure, but the size of commitments would be toolarge. Block TXO commitments could provide a way to have the best of bothworlds - compact proofs and security. However, it's not currently on theBIP table and would require a soft fork.Overall, while the proposed multi-layer multi-block filter idea may have some potential benefits in terms of bandwidth savings, it also adds complexity to the client and relies on behavior that is actively discouraged. Therefore, it may be better to wait and see if clients adopt BIP 157 before considering such a change. Additionally, block TXO commitments could potentially resolve the issue of deciding between the prev script approach and outpoint, but this would require a soft fork and is not currently on the BIP table.</p>
