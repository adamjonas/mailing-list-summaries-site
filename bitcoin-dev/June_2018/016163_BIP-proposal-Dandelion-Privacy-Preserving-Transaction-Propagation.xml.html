    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on the deployment of Dandelion relays was held on the bitcoin-dev platform. The idea is to choose Dandelion relays regardless of whether they support Dandelion or not, with transactions being fluffed if the chosen nodes do not support it, and relayed along a stem if they do. While there doesn't seem to be any problem with this approach, an additional countermeasure will likely be taken against attacks on partial deployment. Wallets may have a configuration option for the use of stem forwarding, which will initially be hidden and set to off. In a subsequent release after widespread deployment, the option will be unhidden and defaulted to on, so users don't begin using it until the deployment is relatively dense.It is believed that this approach is sufficient such that it could always select out-peers that were Dandelion capable without harm. However, for privacy reasons, a three-stage deployment might be preferred, with the use of Dandelion by wallets having a setting of off, sometimes, or always so that attackers can't easily correlate its use with upgrades.</p>
