    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris asked if there is a current use case for SIGHASH_NONE that would suffer from it being non-standard. Johnson Lau has made a pull request to add a new policy to disallow using SIGHASH_SINGLE without matched output, as it is insecure and could lead to theft of any UTXO of the same key in non-segwit scripts. This unintended consensus behavior is one of the earliest ones and these signatures are inherently unsafe, so Johnson believes it does no harm to disable this feature with a softfork. However, since these signatures are currently allowed, the first step is to make them non-standard.</p>
