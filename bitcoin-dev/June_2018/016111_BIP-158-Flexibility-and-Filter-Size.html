    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the implementation of a new filter format and commitment for Bitcoin. The current filter format cannot be committed due to indexing each of the coinbase output scripts. This creates a circular dependency and slows convergence on the design of what would get committed. It is suggested to exclude all OP_RETURN outputs from BIP-158 filters for all transactions as it pollutes the filters. The second item talks about the Tier Nolan proposal to create a "constant" sized proof for future commitments by constraining the size of the block and placing the commitments within the last few transactions in the block, but it is deemed an ugly hack. There are concerns about the implementation of new filters, particularly regarding sync time. However, things that reduce the size of the 158 filters make them seem more likely to be successful.</p>
