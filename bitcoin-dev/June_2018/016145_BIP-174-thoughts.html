    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread discussing BIP 174, a proposal for Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT), some developers expressed concern over making changes to the proposal after it has already been implemented by some parties. Tomas Susanka thanked those involved in the development of the proposal and acknowledged that the discussion should have taken place earlier. However, he argued that agreeing on a good standard should still be a top priority and not to lower demands on the standard because of bad timing. Another developer, Peter D. Gray, disagreed with revising the proposal and argued that there is already a good proposal spec'ed and implemented by multiple parties. He expressed concern about entering "design by committee" territory and suggested pushing out the current proposal before discussing future versions.</p>
