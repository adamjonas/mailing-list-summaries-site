    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Peter D. Gray, recently brought up the topic of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) and the need for them in the ecosystem. Despite the importance of PSBTs, they have been missing from the ecosystem for a long time. Gray urges the community to push this out and start discussing future versions once we learn from the first implementation.However, there is a concern about proposals being implemented without proper public discussion. This can lead to issues where the work needs to be changed when other people begin reviewing it. It can be demoralizing for both designers and reviewers when proposals are put out for discussion but show up implemented in things with vested interests insisting that they not be refined further. This kind of handling is seen as toxic to performing development in public.To improve the situation, the industry should establish a social norm where anytime someone insists an unfinished proposal shouldn't be changed because they already implemented it, the spec should always be changed. This would discourage further instances of this conduct. Although it may seem silly, it could benefit the industry in the long run.</p>
