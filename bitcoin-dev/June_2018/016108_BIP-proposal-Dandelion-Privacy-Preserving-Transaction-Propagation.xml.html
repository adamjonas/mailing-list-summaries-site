    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Dandelion team has received feedback from Pieter Wuille on their protocol and implementation. They plan to prioritize writing a clearer specification for node behavior in the BIP. They recommend not allowing fee filters from peers to influence the choice of route, and suggest automatically fluffing or applying fee filters in the stempool. A node's stempool should accept and propagate Dandelion transactions that depend on other unconfirmed normal mempool transactions. Stem orphans can occur when a node on the stem shuffles its route between sending dependent transactions. The team suggests re-broadcasting all previous Dandelion transactions that have not been fluffed after Dandelion route shuffling or waiting for the fluff phase to begin, at which point the orphans will be resolved. The team found that making Dandelion routing decisions based on claims made by peer nodes can cause problems and recommends against biasing the peer selection code. On the implementation side, the team applies the same logic to the stempool as the mempool in the reference implementation. They suggest using scheduler jobs instead of a separate thread for shuffling the routes.</p>
