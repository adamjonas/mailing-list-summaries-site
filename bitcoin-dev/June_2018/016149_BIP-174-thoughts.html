    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter D. Gray, a developer wrote to the bitcoin-dev mailing list that he has personally implemented a proposal for Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) on an embedded micro as the signer and finalizer roles and written multiple parsers for it as well and there is nothing wrong with it. The PSBT proposal has been spec'ed and implemented by multiple parties and Andrew has been shepherding the pull request for over six months already. In practice, the process surrounding BIPs' production readiness is not nearly as clear as it could be, and there are plenty of BIPs actually deployed in production which are still marked as draft. Pieter believes the per-input derivation paths suggested by matejcik may be worth adding to the PSBT proposal. This would mean that Signers will work with any script, especially relevant to devices where the Signer implementation is hard to change, like when it is implemented in a hardware signer directly.</p>
