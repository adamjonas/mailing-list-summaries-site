        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Darren Weber, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed a new idea on the Bitcoin Github page to enhance security against double-spending attacks. The proposal suggests introducing a hash workload that is proportional to the sum of transactions in a block. The aim is to make it more challenging for malicious attackers to double-spend large amounts by utilizing a relatively brief majority of the network hashing power.However, Thomas Guyot-Sionnest raises concerns about the implementation of this idea. He points out that users may resort to keeping large amounts in multiple smaller addresses to avoid penalties on small transactions. This could lead to an increase in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) size for everyone. Moreover, the proposal would require strong consensus and a hard fork, which might not be deemed worthwhile by some.Darren Weber acknowledges that he does not possess sufficient authority to answer implementation-related questions at this stage. However, he intends to carefully consider the points raised by Guyot-Sionnest before proceeding further with the idea.The proposal on Github has generated discussions regarding its potential benefits and drawbacks. Some believe that introducing a hash workload proportional to transaction sums could enhance security against double-spending attacks. Others express concerns about excluding transactions based on their economic value and the possible negative consequences, such as increased UTXO size for all users. Furthermore, implementing the proposal would necessitate good consensus and a hard fork, leading to differing opinions on whether it is worth pursuing.In conclusion, Darren's suggestion to introduce a hash workload proportional to the sum of transactions in a block aims to strengthen security against double-spending attacks. However, there are various considerations and challenges, including potential side-effects and the requirement for consensus and a hard fork. The proposal has sparked debates within the Bitcoin community, with proponents highlighting its potential benefits and others expressing reservations about its feasibility and impact. Darren plans to explore the idea further, taking into account the concerns raised by Thomas Guyot-Sionnest.</p>
