        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on improving multilingual usage of BIP39, it was suggested that a standard way should be established to convert any words into a hex string, regardless of the language or character encoding. This is in response to the rhetoric that only English words are needed, highlighting the importance of supporting all languages for a standard in wallet seed generation.While there is currently no official Portuguese wordlist or multilingual standard, the ongoing discussion emphasizes the need to start choosing and codifying a standard. To contribute to this effort, a GitHub user has initiated the creation of a Portuguese wordlist which could be beneficial for expanding the BIP039 wordlist.Recognizing the significance of Portuguese as the 6th most spoken language globally and an official language in 10 countries, Breno is interested in proposing the expansion of the BIP039 wordlist to include Portuguese. He is seeking guidance on the steps he should take to make this proposal or to offer assistance if it has already been proposed.</p>
