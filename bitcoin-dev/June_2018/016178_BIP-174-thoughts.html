    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) protocol, William Casarin expressed concern about buffer overflows due to large input or output key-value arrays that could be created through the current design. However, Andrew clarified that the paragraph in question was outdated and that large PSBTs should not be a problem as they require user input rather than remote reception. In response to Andrea's proposal for declaring in advance the number of maps for input/output types, Andrew explained that parsers can determine this information from the unsigned transaction present in each PSBT. He also stated that setting a hard limit on the size of PSBTs is not practical or useful as it may not be extensible for future work and that creating an invalid transaction would be the worst outcome if a PSBT were too large.</p>
