    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests storing only the hashes of unspent outputs, which would reduce the size of a pruned node by 40%. However, the ongoing bandwidth increase of 5% may not be worth it. The storage issue is not cited as a usage limiting factor for pruned nodes. The inefficiency of transaction mechanisms could lead to a 25% increase in overhead when considering the size of a transaction versus the size of transactions with scriptpubkeys and amounts. Implementations can adopt this proposal without permanently changing the blockchain data structure. Low-end devices typically use eMMC storage, which comes in 2x increments. Running a pruned full node on 8GB is difficult if not impossible, but 16 GB is only â‚¬10 more expensive. This proposal may help squeeze more out of limited RAM on low-end devices, which usually have only 1 or 2 GB of RAM. The benefits during initial sync and ongoing operation need to be distinguished. The former is mostly done on a faster computer and copied to the device while the latter needs far less RAM. Testing Cory's branch would determine if squeezing more out of limited RAM actually matters in practice.</p>
