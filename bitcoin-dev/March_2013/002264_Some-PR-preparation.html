    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There was an incident where an honest user accidentally got one transaction into one chain and another into the other. However, if OKPay gets their cash back or freezes the balance, nobody is out BTC for last night, just time and effort. Christian Decker reported that 430 transactions confirmed in the alt-chain were not confirmed in the true blockchain. The good news is that most of them are low volume transactions destined for SD. Seven transactions were true double spends. However, the one transaction that really hurt was the one published on BitcoinTalk. Chris reported that some of the 423 transactions still have a chance of being doublespent, but it looks like it's not that bad after all. Peter is doing a little FUD-fighting right now, but will try and pick up a bit more if necessary tonight after his flight lands.</p>
