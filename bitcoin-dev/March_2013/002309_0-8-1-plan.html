    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on March 17, 2013, Frank F discussed the may15.html page on bitcoin.org. Although he believes it would be unwise to change the page at that point, he also expressed concern about the recommended configuration on the page. Frank stated that while the new lock limit should be good for up to two block deep reorgs, he doubted merchants and miners would want to get stuck if someone pulls off a three-block deep reorg. He suggested that the recommended limit should be at least 292692. Additionally, Frank believed that set_lg_max may need upward bumping, but he wasn't sure how to calculate the correct value. Frank also questioned why the example config does set_lg_dir since it could potentially cause problems if the client is using a different directory. Finally, he requested that a note be added indicating that 0.4.x, 0.5.x, 0.6.x, and 0.7.x will be receiving backports in their next stable releases before May 15.</p>
