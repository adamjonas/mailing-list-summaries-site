    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin version 0.8.0 is considered safe for use in all activities except block creation. This means that the update is available for everyone, except for solo miners and pool operators. However, even they can use it if they connect to the network through a 0.7 node. Despite this limitation, users are encouraged to use the latest version of Bitcoin as it only affects block creation. For those who are not solo miners or pool operators, using version 0.8.x is a viable option as it allows for transactions and queries to be conducted without any issues. It is expected that the issue with block creation will be resolved within a couple of weeks. In the meantime, it is anticipated that the softcode used by ASIC and FPGA miners, as well as pure softminers (GPU), will be updated accordingly.Overall, while there are some limitations to using Bitcoin version 0.8.0, it remains a safe and reliable option for most users. As always, it is recommended to stay up-to-date with the latest versions and updates to ensure optimal performance and security.</p>
