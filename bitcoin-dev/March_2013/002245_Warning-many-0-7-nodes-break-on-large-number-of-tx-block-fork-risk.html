    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Mike Hearn discusses the issue of nodes dying and how it will affect the number of nodes in the coming days. He suggests that mass node death and a hard fork are both serious issues that require immediate action. However, he believes that if mass node death does become an issue, miners will have plenty of incentive to set up high-memory and high-bandwidth nodes to accept transactions. In addition, DNS seeds sort by reliability, so nodes will be able to connect to them quickly. Peter Todd adds to the conversation by mentioning that his home machine has 16GB of RAM, which is larger than the entire blockchain.</p>
