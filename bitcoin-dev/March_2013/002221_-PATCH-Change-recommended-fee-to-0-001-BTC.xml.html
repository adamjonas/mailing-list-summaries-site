    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on March 11, 2013 at 7:27:51 PM, Rune K. Svendsen suggested changing the minimum fee recommendation for Bitcoin transactions from 0.01 BTC to 0.001 BTC or even lower. The current recommendation amounted to about $0.50 at the time of the email. Svendsen recommended making this change on the Main tab in the Options dialog. Svendsen also suggested that pull requests be used on GitHub instead of mailing patches. He further suggested breaking the changes into two commits. The first commit would involve moving the recommended fee outside the translatable string and formatting it using the user's preferred unit. The second commit would change the recommended fee in one place. Svendsen did not express an opinion on whether the recommended fee should be changed or not. However, he noted that some pools/miners would treat anything under 0.01 BTC as if it were no fee at all, despite Eligius using a lower minimum fee.</p>
