    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the reasons behind forks in the Bitcoin network caused by rejection criteria when miners upgrade their software. It is suggested that if new rejection criteria are introduced in an upgrade, miners should upgrade first, while loosening some criteria means that miners should upgrade last. If the same criteria are kept, it is assumed that miners should upgrade last. However, in the case of unawareness of a change, only half of the miners should upgrade. The author also suggests a filtering approach for miners to connect to the network through a node with a version one less than the current to avoid harm caused by rejected blocks, but this may result in lost seconds.</p>
