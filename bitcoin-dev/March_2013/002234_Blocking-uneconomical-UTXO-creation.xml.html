    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on March 12, 2013, Mike Hearn discussed how RAM is used as a database cache. He also addressed a potential attack scenario where a malicious miner could create 1 GB of unspent outputs and then spam nodes with valid transactions. However, he noted that this would not be dangerous if the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) were smaller and fit on RAM. Hearn further questioned what kind of attack the person was considering and suggested that sending a large number of fake transactions to a node that connect to unspent outputs but have invalid transactions would only result in disconnection and IP banning even with current code. Overall, the email exchange highlights concerns around potential attacks on the UTXO and the need for caution when dealing with large amounts of data.</p>
