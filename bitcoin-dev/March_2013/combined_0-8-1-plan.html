        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a conversation on March 17, 2013, Frank F expressed concerns about the recommended configuration on the may15.html page on bitcoin.org. He suggested that the recommended lock limit should be at least 292692 to avoid potential issues with deep reorgs. Frank also questioned the inclusion of set_lg_dir in the example config, as it could cause problems if the client is using a different directory. He requested that a note be added indicating that previous versions will receive backports in their next stable releases before May 15.Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has stated that he will not be changing the date for the upcoming "Bitcoin Independence Day" celebration on May 15. Despite acknowledging that it may be inconvenient and confusing, Andresen is firm in his decision to stick to the original date. He emphasized the need to focus on more important tasks, such as hard-forking to increase the 1MB blocksize limit. This move is seen as practice for the eventual hard-fork required to further increase the blocksize limit.In a conversation on March 16, 2013, between Alan Reiner and Gavin Andresen, the latter mentioned that he chose May 15 as the date for people to upgrade or find a workaround arbitrarily. Reiner suggested pushing back the date by a week due to the Bitcoin Conference being scheduled two days after May 15, which could cause unnecessary stress if something goes wrong. However, changing the date at this point would be impractical since the page bitcoin.org/may15.html had already been created.Gavin Andresen, a developer and Bitcoin pioneer, initially suggested in March 2013 that Bitcoin users should upgrade their software or find workarounds by May 15th. The date was chosen arbitrarily, but Gavin believed that two months provided a reasonable timeframe for everyone to make the necessary changes. Alan, another member of the community, proposed pushing back the deadline by one week to avoid potential stress for conference attendees. However, changing the date was deemed impractical at that point.The Bitcoin team has announced plans for the 0.8.1 release, which includes a new CheckBlock() rule that only allows blocks compatible with old releases to be accepted into the main chain. The limit of 500k to blocks created will also be in effect until May 15. Alerts will be sent to pre-0.8 releases over the next two months, urging users to either upgrade or create a DB_CONFIG file to handle large blocks. The fix was designed to be easily ported to previous versions. The binaries for the 0.8.1 version will be available soon. Multiple alerts will be sent leading up to May 15, reminding users to upgrade or find workarounds. After May 15, miners will be able to create blocks up to 1MB, and users running old versions who ignored the alerts may be left behind.</p>
