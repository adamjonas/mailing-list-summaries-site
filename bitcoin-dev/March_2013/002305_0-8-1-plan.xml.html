    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin team has announced plans for the 0.8.1 release, which includes a new CheckBlock() rule that only allows blocks compatible with old releases to be accepted into the main chain. The limit of 500k to blocks created will also be in effect until May 15. Alerts will be sent to pre-0.8 releases over the next two months telling people to either upgrade or create a DB_CONFIG file so they can handle large blocks. The fix was written to be trivial to port to previous versions and as simple as possible. The binaries for the 0.8.1 version will be available late tomorrow or Monday. An expires-after-24-hours alert will be sent on Tuesday to everybody running pre-0.8, pointing to <a href="http://bitcoin.org/may15.html">http://bitcoin.org/may15.html</a>. Another 24-hour alert will be sent on April 15, reminding everybody again they will need to upgrade or workaround. A final alert that never expires will be sent on May 8th. After May 15, miners will be free to create blocks up to 1MB, and anybody running old versions who ignored the alerts may be left behind.</p>
