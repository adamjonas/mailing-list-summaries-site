    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>. While many clients do keep and relay their own transactions, there are still some who are not able to do so. For these clients, the recent developments may have a greater impact.It's worth noting that this development is not entirely new. End-users have been able to relay their own transactions for quite some time now. However, the recent surge in network activity has made it more difficult for these users to get their transactions confirmed.The move towards self-reliance is in line with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. By allowing end-users to take control of their own transactions, the need for intermediaries is reduced. This could potentially lead to lower fees and faster transaction times.Overall, while the impact of this development may be small for some clients who already relay their own transactions, it could have a greater impact on those who are not able to do so. It remains to be seen how this will affect the broader ecosystem, but it is clear that the move towards self-reliance is a step towards a more decentralized and efficient blockchain network.</p>
