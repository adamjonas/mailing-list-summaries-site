    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Decker, a Bitcoin developer, reported that out of 430 transactions confirmed in the alt-chain, only seven transactions were true double spends. The conflicting transactions were confirmed with their respective amounts: 261 BTC, 0.06 BTC, 0.01 BTC, 0.05 BTC, 0.61 BTC, 1.62 BTC, and 0.81 BTC. The one transaction that caused the most damage was published on BitcoinTalk. Although some of the 423 transactions still have a chance of being doublespent, the situation is not as bad as initially feared. It is essential to confirm that no one has been ripped off, even though there might have been attempts. For a complete list of transactions, see <a href="http://pastebin.com/wctJU3Ln">http://pastebin.com/wctJU3Ln</a>.</p>
