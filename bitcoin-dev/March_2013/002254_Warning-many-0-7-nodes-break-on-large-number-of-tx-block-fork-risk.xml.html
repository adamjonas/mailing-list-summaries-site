    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 12, 2013, Mike Hearn sent an email stating that BDB had run out of locks. However, this only happened on some 0.7 nodes, while others managed it. One megabyte-sized blocks were processed on the testnet, and it wasn't clear why that particular block caused lock exhaustion when other larger blocks had not. According to Mike Hearn, locks are mostly related to block size, and he was unsurprised that the max sized test blocks hadn't triggered it. Michael Gronager replied, stating that forks are caused by rejection criteria. He suggested that if you introduce new rejection criteria in an upgrade, miners should upgrade first. If you loosen some rejection criteria, miners should upgrade last. And if you keep the same criteria, assume miners will upgrade last. Finally, Michael Gronager raised a concern about making changes without being aware of them.</p>
