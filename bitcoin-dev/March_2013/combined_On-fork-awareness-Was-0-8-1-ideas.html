        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Andy Parkins and Luke-Jr on March 13, 2013, the failure of developing two chains was discussed. The state was irreconcilable without manual intervention, and client assurances that transactions were secure were not met. Luke-Jr proposed changing the definition of "6 confirmations" so that it only clears of any other chain and is reliable while there are two competing chains. However, this proposal has its own limitations as only peers who have accepted a competing chain will hear about it.Relaying non-primary chains presents challenges such as preventing it from being a DOS vector and rating limit by only relaying chains which are close to the current best in sum difficulty. Another issue is that nodes may not be motivated to tell peers about an invalid chain as they want their peers on their view of the consensus. To address these issues, Luke-Jr suggested only relaying headers for non-primary chains as a potential solution.</p>
