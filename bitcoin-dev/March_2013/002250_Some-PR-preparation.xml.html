    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 12, 2013, Alan Reiner expressed concern about the potential negative attention that could arise from an event involving Bitcoin. He believed it was important to prepare PR comments in advance to combat any inaccurate or exaggerated reporting. Reiner emphasized that the event was a short and harmless lapse in network consensus that caused transaction delays rather than a threat to the safety of coins. However, Luke cautioned against downplaying the reality of the situation as transactions could have been reversed and scams were still possible even with standard precautions. The event received media attention due to Bitcoin's rising popularity at the time.</p>
