    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on the BitcoinTalk forum in March 2013, user Peter Vessenes asked if anyone had determined if there were any double-spend attempts related to the recent blockchain fork that occurred. Gregory Maxwell responded and agreed that it would be good to confirm that no one was ripped off, even though they couldn't say for certain that there weren't any attempts. It is unclear from this context whether any further action was taken to investigate possible double-spends.</p>
