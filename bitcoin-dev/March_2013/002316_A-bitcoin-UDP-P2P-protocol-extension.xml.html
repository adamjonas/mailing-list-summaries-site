    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Luke-Jr and Randy Willis on March 23rd, 2013, the idea of introducing super-nodes with thousands of connected peers was proposed as a potential solution to help with UDP and bitcoin protocol. However, Luke-Jr pointed out that UDP is connectionless and any UDP bitcoin protocol should not try to emulate a connection.  The conversation then moved towards the usage of UDP and signaling acceptance of messages. While broadcasting a TX or INV to a remote peer does not require a connection, subscribing to a broadcast requires some notion of association. In the rough draft, a parallel TCP connection with version/verack sequence is required and can be used if a connection is needed. Alternatively, a more robust and heavyweight UDP P2P could be a hole-punching TCP alternative, but this approach would require experimentation and community input. Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc. mentioned Bittorrent's evolution of a full transfer protocol over UDP to get around firewalls and the like.</p>
