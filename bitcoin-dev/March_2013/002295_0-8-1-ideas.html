    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated March 13, 2013, Gregory Maxwell and Roy Badami discussed the idea of client detection and warning in the case of not-trivial forking. While Maxwell mentioned that the warning feature already existed if the fork was heard and on the lower difficulty side, he agreed that extending it to alert users when on the winning side and the fork was long enough would be wise. However, he expressed concern that it might be mistaken to be more dependable than it truly was.Badami suggested that such a warning system would have been helpful during a recent incident where Bitcoin users using version 0.8 were affected by a bug. He believed that if a warning had been issued, all 0.8 users would have been informed immediately, thus reducing the element of luck involved in resolving the issue.</p>
