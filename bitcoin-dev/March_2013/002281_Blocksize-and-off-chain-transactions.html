    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Michael Gronager clarified that the issues were in version 0.7 and below, not in 0.8. He argued that changing features in 0.8 to accommodate the previous versions was not a good solution, as it would not cover similar situations in the future. The current behavior in 0.7 is broken and cannot be kept as a rule on the network. However, a hard fork is required to change this behavior, but dropping support for old nodes without discussion is not reasonable. The way forward is to get a 0.8.1 version that mimics the old behavior while fixing the lock limit issue. Patches can also be provided for 0.7 and previous branches to enforce the same limit as 0.8.1. A hard fork will eventually be necessary to drop the 0.8.1 limit, but it requires widespread community consensus. Pieter suggests limiting the hard fork to direct bug fixes and leaving the block limit issue for later, as a hard fork would be inevitable.</p>
