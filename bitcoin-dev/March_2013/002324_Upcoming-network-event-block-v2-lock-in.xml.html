    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion took place on March 23, 2013, between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr regarding the implementation of the miner end of BIP 34. Luke-Jr claimed that bitcoind was nowhere in the implementation of the miner end of BIP 34, but Jeff Garzik corrected him by saying that it's not entirely true. He mentioned that bitcoind's 'getblocktemplate' RPC call is used by some to supply the block version, select transactions for the miner, and perform other tasks integral to the implementation of the miner and BIP 34. However, Luke-Jr argued that transaction selection and everything else done by bitcoind is irrelevant to BIP 34. He stated that it is incompatible with getblocktemplate for coinbase-creating software to produce v2 blocks without implementing BIP 34 themselves, even if the upstream GBT server specifies it.</p>
