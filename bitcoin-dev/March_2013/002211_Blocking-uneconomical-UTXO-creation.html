    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about Bitcoin network destroying or giving away coins, if the coins are not moved. The writer argues that smart property/colored coins transactions are not spam because they pay fees. However, the problem for the network is old unspent outputs and not transactions that move less coins than they pay. The writer proposes sudden destruction of accounts by miners or re-generation after a certain period instead of rejecting potential use cases for the chain. The writer prefers small fixed demurrage fee after the X blocks without moving them, but since this community is demurrage allergic, the second-best option is to charge a fee for a resource that users are enjoying and has real costs for the network. Gavin Andresen rejects the idea of non-proportional demurrage as it will never happen and it would result in negative publicity.</p>
