    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concern raised is regarding TCP/UDP port forwarding for transferring bulk data. UDT (UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol) uses UDP as its transport layer protocol to transfer bulk data with its own reliability control and congestion control mechanisms. The protocol allows multiple UDT flows to share a single UDP port, which makes it possible for a firewall to open only one UDP port for all UDT connections. However, the protocol may not be friendly to NAT, which can cause some issues.A suggestion is made to consider modern alternatives to UDP, such as UDT and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol). UDT is considered as a solution for breaking the data transfer bottleneck. The source code for UDT is available on their website. SCTP is another protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. It also supports multiple streams of messages in a single connection. Overall, the concern is about the limitations of TCP/UDP port forwarding for bulk data transfer and the suggestion is made to explore alternative protocols like UDT and SCTP that may offer better solutions.</p>
