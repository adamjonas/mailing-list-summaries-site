        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community has been discussing the possibility of providing tools to help users manage key compromise and retirement. Currently, the only solution for a user who suspects their keys may be compromised is to create a new wallet and transfer all coins from the old one, which can be tedious and lead to loss of transaction history. To address this issue, the community has proposed several solutions.One proposed solution is the implementation of a big key compromise button that would automatically transfer all coins to newly generated addresses. This approach could be paired with a server that checks for unauthorized transactions on the blockchain for an automated layer of security. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of this approach, particularly for enterprise scenarios. Another proposed solution is the use of retired addresses marked with a flag so that if someone sends coins to the address, bitcoind immediately generates a transaction to transfer the coins to good addresses. Users prefer having a bag of keys over deterministic wallets. Old keys should be retired, and their balances should automatically transfer to newly generated keys.In 2013, a Bitcoin developer named Roy suggested the implementation of a big key compromise button for Bitcoin that would automatically transfer all coins to newly generated addresses. However, Andrew Poelstra raised concerns about this idea as it could lead to an attacker identifying which public key is in use and believed to be compromised. Consequently, Roy realized that what he wanted was not automatic transmissions but rather a means to revoke an address. He proposed an address revocation protocol that would give clients an error if their user tries to send coins to a revoked address. The protocol would have to be universally implemented by clients to be useful.Overall, the Bitcoin community is exploring various ideas to improve the management of key compromise and retirement, including the use of a 'dead' button that would send pre-generated transactions to previously secured addresses in case of an emergency. However, there are still differing opinions on the effectiveness of these approaches, particularly for enterprise scenarios.</p>
