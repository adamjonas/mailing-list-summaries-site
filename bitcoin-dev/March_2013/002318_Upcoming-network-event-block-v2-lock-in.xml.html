    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer, announced on March 23, 2013 that the Bitcoin network would be undergoing a fork to version 2 due to issues with version 1. He assured users that they should not be impacted by this change and the solution for miners was simply to use a recent bitcoind (0.7 or later) to mine. However, some ancient miners would produce newly-invalid blocks that would get ignored. Garzik encouraged miners who needed help upgrading to version 2 to reach out for assistance via #bitcoin-dev or bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net.One individual responded, saying that they were not aware of anyone mining using bitcoind 0.7 or later, with Deepbit being the only pool known to use bitcoind at all, which was based on 0.3.21. However, several other open source poolservers had already supported v2 blocks for months, including p2pool since August 8, 2012, Eloipool since September 1, 2012, and slush's stratum server since its creation. It was noted that PoolServerJ and ecoinpool were known to break when v2 blocks became mandatory.</p>
