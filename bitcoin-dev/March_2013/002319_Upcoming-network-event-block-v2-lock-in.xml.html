    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr on March 23, 2013, the latter expressed his belief that nobody was using bitcoind 0.7 or later for mining purposes. Garzik responded by listing several mining pools, including slush, BTC Guild, and ozcoin, which he believed were still utilizing this version of the software. However, he noted that these pools were not using it for producing coinbases due to the implementation of BIP 34.</p>
