    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In March 2013, Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr discussed the implementation of BIP 34 in mining using bitcoind 0.7 or later. Luke-Jr stated that he didn't think anyone was mining using bitcoind 0.7 or later for producing coinbases where BIP 34 was implemented. However, Jeff Garzik countered this by mentioning that several pools including slush, BTC Guild, ozcoin, and others were indeed doing so. Luke-Jr clarified that this was largely due to the pool server layer but it was still misleading to imply that bitcoind was not involved in the stack. The context revealed that although bitcoind was not used in the implementation of the miner end of BIP 34, it was still present in the stack.</p>
