    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Currently, there are four potential places for bugs to be reported - Jenkins (and unit tests), Git, the mailing list, and forums such as Bitcointalk. However, Github is now the authoritative place to report issues. When someone reports a bug on the mailing list, IRC or forum, they are generally asked to make a Github issue or someone else makes the issue for them. Failed tests are also reported on Github by the pull tester.There are currently 232 issues on Github, mostly classified into categories such as "Bug," "Improvement," "GUI," "Wallet," and so on. It's easy to refer to Github issues in commits with #123, with automatic linking.While there may be other bug reporting systems available, Wladimir does not believe it's worth the effort to move to another system, especially if it requires another login.</p>
