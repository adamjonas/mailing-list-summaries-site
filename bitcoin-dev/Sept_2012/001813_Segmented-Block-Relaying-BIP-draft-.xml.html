    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Matthew Mitchell shared a branch with his implementation of parts of the header+ v stuff in conjunction with his bloom filter stuff. He admits that it is pretty simple and susceptible to issues like getting stuck or DoS attacks, but in theory, it works. Matt doesn't see much need for anything more complicated, but he acknowledges that there may be use-cases he's missing. Gregory Maxwell responded to Mitchell's proposal for improving block relaying and validation by asking why it focuses on sending the hash tree when the block header, transaction list, and transactions a node doesn't already know (usually just the coinbase) are sufficient. Mitchell had drafted a BIP proposal for improving the process so that it can be done in parallel and redundancy can be removed, which would be more beneficial for larger block sizes. The proposal is available on the Bitcoin wiki page.</p>
