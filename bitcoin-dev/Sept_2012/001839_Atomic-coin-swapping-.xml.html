    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is interested in transitive/multi-hop transactions with colored coins, but does not understand why it's not possible. The default SIGHASH_ALL indicates that everything about the transaction is signed, except for the input scripts, which are always blanked out to avoid making it impossible to construct a transaction. The author suggests that a new SIGHASH_* type that doesn't pay attention to this "obviously" is needed to achieve what they want. They provide an example of a necessary sign for a transaction involving A, B, and C. Jeff Garzik discusses colored coins in IRC and their potential interesting applications in distributed bonds. He poses a problem in which Alice transfers a 1-satoshi colored coin to Bob, who then transfers 100 BTC to Alice in an atomic unit, all or nothing. Both must approve the transfer with appropriate signatures, but he's unsure if this is possible within the current bitcoin system. Jeff suspects that a new SIGHASH_* type is required to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
