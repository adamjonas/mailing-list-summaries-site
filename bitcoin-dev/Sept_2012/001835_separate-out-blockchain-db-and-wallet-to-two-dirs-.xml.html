    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Scott Howard and Wladimir, a proposal was made to move the >2 GB db to $HOME/.cache/bitcoin while leaving the wallet and other config files in $HOME/.bitcoin. The reasoning behind this proposal is so backups can skip the .cache directory and follows the freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Specification. However, it was pointed out that this is currently not feasible due to BerkelyDB limitations as all the databases are within one 'environment' which is necessarily one directory. It was suggested that when LevelDB for the block chain and the custom format for wallets is introduced, various new configurations will be possible such as multiple wallets and wallets in block chain in separate directories.</p>
