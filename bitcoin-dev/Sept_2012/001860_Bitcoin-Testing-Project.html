    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Wladimir and Steve, they discussed the current system of reporting bugs for Bitcoin. Currently, Github is the authoritative place to report issues with 232 issues mostly classified into categories such as "Bug", "Improvement", "GUI", "Wallet", and so on. Steve wanted to develop a QA environment that is conducive to testing and will allow the testers to shine in all their glory. He wants different tools and methodologies apart from bug reporting to test the software. He said Git is too developer-centric to be useful for organizing testing, but there is a large amount of software compatible with Git, so the core development team only ever needs to work with Git. The linking between a bug, the requirement, the fix, the re-test, and updating of the regression test plan is vital. They also discussed the ability to organize testing campaigns and assigning tests, work units, and test relevant docs/scripts/ideas, etc.</p>
