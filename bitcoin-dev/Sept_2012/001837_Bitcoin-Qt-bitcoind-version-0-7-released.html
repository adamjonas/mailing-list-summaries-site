    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The new version of bitcoin, version 0.7.0, has been released and is now available for download from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.7.0/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.7.0/</a>. It is recommended that anyone running an older version upgrade to this release. Bugs should be reported using the issue tracker at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues</a>. The source code for the project can also be found on GitHub and source-only tarballs/zipballs can be downloaded from there as well. Ubuntu Linux users can use a "Personal Package Archive" (PPA) to keep bitcoin up-to-date.To upgrade an older version of bitcoin, shut it down and wait until it has completely shut down before installing the new version. If you were running an older version of bitcoin on Linux that may have been compiled with a different version of Berkeley DB, run the old version again with the -detachdb argument and shut it down before installing the new version. Incompatible changes include the replacement of 'getmemorypool' RPC command with 'getblocktemplate/submitblock' and 'getrawmempool' commands, and the removal of deprecated RPC 'getblocknumber'. Several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals have been implemented, including BIP 22, BIP 34, and BIP 35.Improvements have been made to core bitcoin handling and blockchain database, JSON-RPC API, P2P networking, and Qt GUI. Internal codebase also includes additional unit tests and compile warning fixes. This release of bitcoin was made possible by contributions from several individuals, including Chris Moore, Gavin Andresen, Gregory Maxwell, Jeff Garzik, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Denial-of-service vulnerabilities were reported by Sergio Lerner.</p>
