        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion primarily focuses on the testing of Bitcoin software. Matt Corallo suggests that there is a need for actual testing rather than just talking about it. He highlights that current code coverage lacks simple testing cycle documentation and is unimpressive. To catch platform interactions and faults in uncovered code, Corallo recommends using automated tests. Jenkins is mentioned as a tool that runs the test script after each new commit to Bitcoin and provides binaries. However, he believes that more substance is needed in the form of useful testing.Steve expresses interest in unifying all build testing and test cases into one place. He outlines three types of test cases: requirements-based (edge cases and known interoperability issues), external interface tests, and functional tests. The ndComparisonTool.jar file is used to run test cases for block acceptance edge cases. Additionally, the author prefers scripting all testing and suggests using Jenkins for this purpose, which can have slave workers using a different OS that runs its own tests and reports back to the main Jenkins instance.Matt is in favor of more testing but is unsure about keeping all tests in one place. On the other hand, Steve has developed rudimentary requirements, basic requirement tracking, and tests to prove/stress the requirements. He is also working on evaluating the best workflow process through various opensource applications such as mantis, salomeTMF, and bugzilla. Steve has over 400 test cases and is ready to go. However, there is no information available about any issues uncovered during the testing.</p>
