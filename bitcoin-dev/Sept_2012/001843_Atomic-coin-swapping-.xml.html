    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 22, 2012, a discussion took place between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik regarding the signing of input scripts in Bitcoin transactions. Hearn stated that signing input scripts would make it impossible to construct a transaction, as signatures cannot sign themselves. He clarified that if scriptSigs were included in the data being signed, inserting a newly calculated signature for one input would break the signatures for all others. Garzik confirmed that SIGHASH_ALL was the crucial piece he was missing and updated his post with a concrete example to recreate it. Jorge Timón expressed interest in transitive/multi-hop transactions with colored coins and asked if there were any plans to implement them.</p>
