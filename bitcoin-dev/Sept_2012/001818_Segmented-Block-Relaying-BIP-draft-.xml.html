    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is experiencing issues with Sourceforge not sending updates, but can view replies online. They propose a simpler protocol for Bitcoin transactions to be downloaded separately by nodes, which could allow requests for any level of the merkle tree. The proposal will enable nodes to request multiple transactions at once and provide protection against future demands. The writer suggests analyzing how beneficial this proposal would be and measuring peer behavior. They believe it's essential to think ahead and prepare for the possibility of block sizes exceeding 0.1MB. The writer questions why the block size limit should not be lifted and fears that large fees may deter transactions, leading to unconfirmed transactions and annoyed users. Finally, they recommend discussing these issues well in advance to avoid any last-minute problems.</p>
