    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Linux systems primarily use the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which is often modified by different distributions. On the other hand, BSD systems typically follow the traditional hierarchy and may add directories like /home and /opt as needed. It is up to the user to decide which camp they belong to. Bitcoin is not an X app at its core, so the XDG specification does not apply to it. Additionally, Bitcoin does not have a user-agnostic system daemon for processing blocks separately from user wallet operations. Therefore, it is suggested that until a solution is found, the files remain split up somewhere under .bitcoin rather than in /var or elsewhere. The author also humorously requests assistance in figuring out where to place their messages, indicating a possible misunderstanding or confusion about the file system hierarchy.</p>
