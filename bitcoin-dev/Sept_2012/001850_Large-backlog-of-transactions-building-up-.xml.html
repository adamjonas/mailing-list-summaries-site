    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Jorge Timón, Jeff Garzik, and Gregory Maxwell revolves around transactions that are not yet in the blockchain. Garzik mentioned that a deterministic lifetime for a transaction would help initiate recovery procedures and prevent zombie transactions from wasting resources without getting confirmed. However, Timón questioned if the chain could enforce this number and why clients couldn't delete these transactions. Maxwell explained that there are bursts of weird transactions that miners exclude intentionally. He also stated that double-spending transactions are not stored, creating huge chains. These transactions depend on their parent, which is dropped due to rule violations. As a result, the software keeps them around as orphans until their parent arrives. Maxwell suggested maintaining a cache of rejected transaction IDs to consult for orphan transactions' parents, but it would need to be dropped during reorgs.</p>
