    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2 has been released with bug fixes, the BIP65 (CLTV) consensus change, and relay policy preparation for BIP113. It is recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible. This release includes several changes related to the BIP65 soft fork which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a specified point in the future.Blocks will be stored on disk out of order, making it incompatible with some tools or other programs. The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support. Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when they may be added to a valid block. Current consensus rules require that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.Several Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the entire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Bitcoin Core on Windows (or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns remain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for the UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean shutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing.Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release. The given context seems to be a PGP signature. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is a widely used encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. It is mainly used for securing email communications, but it can also be used for file storage and encryption of texts. The PGP signature is created using the sender's private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender's public key. The long string of characters after the signature block is the encrypted message that has been signed by the sender. This encrypted message can only be decrypted by the recipient who has the matching private key to the sender's public key. The purpose of the PGP signature is to provide assurance to the recipient that the message has not been tampered with during transmission and that it has indeed come from the claimed sender. Overall, PGP is a very useful tool for secure communication and is widely used in many industries to protect sensitive information. By using PGP encryption, users can ensure that their messages are safe from prying eyes and that they can communicate freely without fear of interception or tampering.</p>
