    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made in November 2015 to gradually increase the maximum block size of Bitcoin. The proposal suggested increasing the block size to 2 MB at the next block subsidy halving, with subsequent increases at each halving until reaching a maximum block size of 32 MB. The proposal aimed to restore the default 32 MB block size originally implemented by Satoshi and provide a long-term solution without assuming future bandwidth and storage availability estimates. The maximum block size of 32 MB would allow for peak usage of approximately 100 transactions per second by 2031. The proposal also suggested exercising the network upgrade procedure during the subsidy reward halving to increase awareness among miners and node operators. The proposal included specifications for increasing the maximum block size at specific blocks and noted that older clients would not be compatible with the change, creating a network partition excluding not-upgraded nodes and miners.</p>
