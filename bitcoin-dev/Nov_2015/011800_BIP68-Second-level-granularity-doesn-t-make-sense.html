    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd proposed changes to BIP68, which defines the rules for locktime in transactions. The current specification creates an awkward situation where users of by-height locktimes have 14 bits unused in nSequence, but by-time locktimes only have 5 bits unused. Todd suggests making by-time locks use the same number of bits as by-height locks, and multiplying the by-time lock field by the block interval. Another participant in the discussion pointed out that this issue had already been addressed and resolved in a previous version of the specification. Todd was pleased to see that his conclusions matched those of previous discussions.</p>
