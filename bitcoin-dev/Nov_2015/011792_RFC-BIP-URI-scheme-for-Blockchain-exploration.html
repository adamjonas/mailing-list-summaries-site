    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a proposed new URI scheme for Blockchain exploration. The proposed scheme aims to enable users to handle all requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc., with their preferred tool, whether that be a web service or a local application. Currently, Bitcoin clients usually point to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction. The same happens with posts and messages that reference specific txs or blocks, if they provide links at all.The proposed URI scheme follows a simple form: blockchain: <blockchain explorer link>. The email thread includes examples of the proposed format. The proposal suggests keeping it simple, as blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. Using this scheme means that wallet developers (or other tools that need to show any kind of Blockchain references) can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one.Blockchain explorers, in turn, will offer to handle the blockchain: URI, the first time the user visits their website or launches/install the application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one. Users get the convenience of using their preferred explorer, which can be especially handy on mobile devices, where juggling with cut&paste is far from ideal. The email thread references Eternity Wall as an example of a service that provides a use case for the proposed new URI scheme.</p>
