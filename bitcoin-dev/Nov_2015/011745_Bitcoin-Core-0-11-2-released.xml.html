    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Scotese posted his attempt to certify Wladimir's PGP keys. He found that the old key signed a message containing the reference to the new key, but he was unable to verify it on Windows with Kleopatra. However, SHA256SUMS.asc file downloaded from the magnet link posted in the email verifies fine using the new key. Dave believes that something might be wrong with Kleopatra on Windows.Wladimir released Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2 which is available for download from bitcoin.org/bin/. This version brings several bug fixes, the BIP65 (CLTV) consensus change and relay policy preparation for BIP113. Users are recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible. The issue tracker at Github can be used to report bugs.The latest release of Bitcoin Core, version 0.11.2, includes a number of bug fixes and minor improvements including the long-awaited implementation of BIP113 (Median Time-Past as Endpoint for Lock-Time Calculations) which improves the accuracy of locktime handling and makes Bitcoin more secure overall. Miners are urged to update their software to avoid producing invalid blocks in the future and users are advised to subtract one hour from their locktimes to ensure their transactions are included in mempools at approximately the expected time. Notably, this release includes changes related to the BIP65 soft fork, which aims to redefine the OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV), enabling the creation of unspendable transaction outputs until a specified point in the future. For miners, bitcoin's block templates are now for version 4 blocks only, meaning that mining software must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either version 0.4.3 or any version from 0.5.2 onwards. Additionally, BIP113 mempool-only locktime enforcement using GetMedianTimePast() has been introduced, whereby transactions whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will no longer be accepted into the mempool.Another notable improvement concerns the UTXO database on Windows machines, which will no longer rely on memory-mapped files, thus reducing instances where reindexing was required after an unclean shutdown. A full list of changes can be found in the release notes. The update was made possible by contributions from over a dozen developers, including Alex Morcos and Gregory Maxwell.However, there are warnings for users looking to downgrade back to previous versions due to incompatibility issues caused by changes to block files and databases.</p>
