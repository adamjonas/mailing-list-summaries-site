    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Luke Dashjr and Jorge Timón revolves around the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 99 (BIP99), which recommends a 95% miner upgrade confirmation with version bits for uncontroversial hardforks, just like it does for softforks. However, Timón believes that miners should not be left out of decision-making since they are part of the bitcoin economy. Dashjr, on the other hand, argues that miners do not necessarily belong to the economic majority that decides hardforks. He notes that the more relevant factor in terms of economic involvement is acceptance of bitcoins as payment for real goods.Dashjr also points out that miners tend to upgrade at a different rate than the economy. Therefore, he suggests incorporating a miner-trigger, but only if the flag is enabled in nodes by an option disabled by default. The BIP must clearly specify that miners must not enable it until they perceive complete economic adoption of the change. Timón disagrees with this approach and believes that uniformity in trigger mechanisms is essential for each rule change; otherwise, consensus can fail. Moreover, he questions how miners are supposed to "perceive" adoption. According to Timón, the time threshold must be set enough in the future to give users time to upgrade. Nonetheless, both parties agree that schism hardforks are treated differently, and the miner upgrade confirmation becomes entirely irrelevant.</p>
