    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new mailing list called bitcoin-discuss has been created for more free-flowing topics related to Bitcoin governance, policy or other meta-issues. The bitcoin-dev moderation team requests that further discussion on these topics be taken to this forum instead of the current one. A member named Peter R suggests discussing how Bitcoin should be governed in the first place and whether it should evolve from the “bottom up” or from the “top down”. If one’s answer is from the “bottom up,” then the meta-level criteria is very easy: we do what the people want and allow them to weigh the tradeoffs. Regarding the block size limit debate, if one concedes that Bitcoin should be governed from the “bottom up,” then it is already possible to empower each node operator to express his free choice regarding the size of blocks he is willing to accept while simultaneously ensuring that his node tracks consensus.</p>
