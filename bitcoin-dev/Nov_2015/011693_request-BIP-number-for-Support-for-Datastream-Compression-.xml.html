    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Tschipper has opened a pull request (#6973) for Zlib Block Compression for block relay. At the request of @sipa, this should have a BIP associated with it. The idea is to compress the data stream before sending, initially for blocks only but it could theoretically be done for transactions as well. Initial results show an average of 20% block compression and taking 90 milliseconds for a full block (on a very slow laptop) to compress. The savings will be mostly in terms of less bandwidth used, but there might be a small performance gain during the transmission of the blocks particularly where network latency is higher. However, the trade-off decisions among bandwidth savings, CPU performance, and latency are local, and it shouldn't be assumed that any particular node will want to support it. Jonathan Corgan recommends that if P2P message compression is implemented, it should be negotiated via the services field at connection time.</p>
