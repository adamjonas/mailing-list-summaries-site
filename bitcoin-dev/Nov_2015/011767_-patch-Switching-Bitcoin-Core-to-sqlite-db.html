    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Peter R. and another individual discuss the difference between accepting a block of valid transactions and accepting a transaction that creates ten thousand bitcoins out of nothing. The former would be welcomed by the market while the latter would be rejected. The conversation then shifts to the political implications of the bitcoin system and the various rules that govern it. The individual argues that the one rule of the bitcoin system is not categorically distinct from other criteria such as confiscation of funds via external authority and economic controls to regulate the supply of money for the good of the economy. The conversation ends with the individual correcting Peter R.'s statement about consensus inconsistencies in implementations of the bitcoin system, stating that none have been discovered thus far and that the details of political inertia should not be debated on this technical mailing list.</p>
