    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The second Scaling Bitcoin Workshop will take place on December 6th-7th in Hong Kong. Technical proposals are being accepted until November 9th for improving Bitcoin performance, including designs, experimental results, and comparisons against other proposals. The workshop aims to present potential solutions to scalability challenges while identifying key areas for further research and providing a venue for communication between researchers, developers, and miners. Proposals may be submitted as a BIP or as a 1-2 page extended abstract describing ideas, designs, and expected experimental results. Accepted authors will have an opportunity to give a 20-30 minute presentation at the workshop, or run an hour-long interactive workshop. Topics of interest include improving Bitcoin throughput, layer 2 ideas, security and privacy, incentives and fee structures, testing, simulation, and modeling, network resilience, anti-spam measures, block size proposals, mining concerns, and community coordination. All talks will be livestreamed and published online, including slide decks. The last day for submissions has been extended by two days, with proposals due by November 11th at 23:59 UTC.</p>
