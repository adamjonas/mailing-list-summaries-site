        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On November 14, 2015, Peter Tschipper reached out to the bitcoin-dev community via a post on the platform. In the post, Tschipper requested permission to utilize service bit 28 for the purpose of testing the block compression prototype. The author seemed to be interested in determining whether anyone objected to this request or if the service bit was already being used by someone else. In response to Tschipper's inquiry, another user responded affirmatively, stating that there were no objections to the use of service bit 28. Additionally, this user mentioned that bit 26 was currently being utilized to indicate full-RBF (replace-by-fee) support in their replace-by-fee branch. Furthermore, the user suggested that the preferential peering code from their replace-by-fee branch might prove helpful for testing purposes.Overall, Tschipper's message appeared to be a polite inquiry, as evidenced by the author's expression of gratitude in advance.</p>
