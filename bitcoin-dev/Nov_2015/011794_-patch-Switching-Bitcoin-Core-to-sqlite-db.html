    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member named telemaco raised the question of whether an odbc jdbc jconnect or equivalent should be transparent for the consensus code. Another member responded that while it should be transparent in theory, they are currently only testing levelDB and cannot guarantee there won't be unintended consensus forks with other databases behind a db-agnostic interface. They believe that Bitcoin Core should officially support only one database at a time and if that were to change in the future, it should not be before a storage-agnostic libconsensus is encapsulated. There would still be risks and costs in supporting multiple databases simultaneously even after that point. The member also noted that such experiments are welcomed outside of bitcoin/master.</p>
