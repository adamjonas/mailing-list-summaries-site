    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a recent post on Bitcoin.org has expressed concern about the site's neutrality, claiming that it is important to maintain an unbiased platform for information on bitcoin, its applications, and exchanges. The author criticizes the recent merge of a pull request (PR) that would allow Google Analytics on the site, stating that this goes against the "who is in charge of bitcoin" rules and violates the bitcoin "philosophy." Additionally, another PR not yet merged would enable ads on the site, which the author argues would attack the neutrality model of Bitcoin.org. The author questions how changes on Bitcoin.org occur, asking whether they follow consensus-agreement among contributors or if a group of people decides what to merge and what not to merge. The author suggests that if site operators or contributors need to be paid for their work or pay for infrastructure, the root problem should be addressed, and funds should be raised for such purposes. The author offers help to speak to bitcoin businesses and individuals for fundraising.</p>
