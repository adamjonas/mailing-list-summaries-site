        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The post discusses the compression of transactions in Bitcoin, which was moved from main.cpp to streams.h (CDataStream) and added to transactions. A table is included with results showing the range of block size, average uncompressed and compressed transaction size, compression ratio, and number of datapoints taken. The post notes that transactions below 500 bytes do not compress well, but those beyond 1KB compress very well.Additionally, the post presents results comparing performance when network latency is added. Two nodes were run on Windows 7, and the first 200000 blocks were synced from one node to another using Netbalancer to induce 30ms and 60ms latencies. Results show that bandwidth savings are seen along with a small performance savings. Saving bandwidth appears to be the primary value of compressing blocks. There was no significant difference in performance when no latency was present.Finally, the post includes a table comparing the time it takes to sync the blockchain, compressed vs uncompressed, with varying latencies. The table shows the number of blocks synced, uncompressed and compressed times, and times with 30ms and 60ms latencies. Overall, the post provides valuable insights into the compression of transactions in Bitcoin and its potential benefits in terms of bandwidth savings.</p>
