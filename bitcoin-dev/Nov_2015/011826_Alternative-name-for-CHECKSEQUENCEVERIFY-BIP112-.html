    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach expressed his objection to the use of nSequence in Bitcoin's implementation. He suggested renaming it to nMaturity, a suggestion he had previously made before the implementation began. However, he acknowledged that it was now too late to make such changes without disrupting the implementation. Friedenbach likened this situation to that of refactors and major releases, where it is challenging to find the right time to make changes without risking disruptions or delays. The email thread also included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed.</p>
