    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BIP68 introduces relative lock-time semantics to part of the nSequence field, with the majority of bits left undefined for future applications. BIP112 introduces opcode CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (OP_CSV) that verifies transaction inputs according to BIP68's relative lock-time. However, the name OP_CSV is broader than that. As there will be completely different use cases that take advantage of unused nSequence bits, it is suggested that BIP112 should be renamed specifically for its use case of verifying the time/maturity of transaction inputs relative to their inclusion in a block. Suggestions for renaming include CHECKMATURITYVERIFY, RELATIVELOCKTIMEVERIFY, RCHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and RCLTV. It is noted that additional meaning could be softforked into OP_CSV for future sequence number use cases, but this would become obscure and confusing. Instead, giving BIP112 opcode a name that reflects its actual use case is recommended.</p>
