    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate over increasing the block size for Bitcoin has led to various proposals, but Emin GÃ¼n Sirer asks a more fundamental question: what are the grand goals that a truly perfect function would achieve? Rather than debating specific block size increase functions, Sirer asks how we can evaluate a good proposal. He proposes meta-goals, such as increasing the block size while ensuring that large miners never have an advantage over small miners that they did not have in the preceding 6 months, or increasing block size as much as possible subject to the constraint that 90% of the nodes on the network are no more than 1 minute behind one of the tails of the blockchain 99% of the time. Sirer suggests that some specific meta-level criteria would help more at this point than new proposals all exploring different variants of block size increase schedules.</p>
