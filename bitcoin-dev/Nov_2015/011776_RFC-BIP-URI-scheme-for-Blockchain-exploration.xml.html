    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a simple URI scheme for Blockchain exploration was made by Marco Pontello. This scheme would allow users to handle all requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred tool, whether that is a web service or a local application. Currently, Bitcoin clients typically point to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for transaction details, and sometimes resorting to cut-and-paste is necessary. The proposed URI follows a simple form: "blockchain:" followed by the block or transaction ID. The rationale behind this scheme is that it should be practical enough to use and that blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. Wallet developers and other tools that need to show any kind of Blockchain references could use this scheme as a blockchain link without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one. Blockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain: URI, the first time the user visits their website, or launch/install the application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one.</p>
