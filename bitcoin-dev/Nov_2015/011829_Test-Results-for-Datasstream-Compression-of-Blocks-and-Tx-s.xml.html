    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The reference implementation for compressing blocks and transactions, which also concatenates blocks and transactions when possible, has been tested with results comparing Zlib to the LZOx library. The tests show the time it takes to sync the first part of the blockchain, with latency on the network resulting in all compression libraries performing much better than without compression. Although Zlib is better for compressibility, LZOx is faster, most scalable, and provides decent compression that approaches Zlib. The compression ratio achieved for various sizes of data shows Zlib as the clear winner for compressibility, with LZOx-999 coming close but at a cost. LZO1x is the fastest, and as file sizes increase, LZO1x time hardly increases at all. However, as compression ratios increase, LZOx-999 performs much worse than Zlib. So, LZO is faster on the low end and slower on the high end.</p>
