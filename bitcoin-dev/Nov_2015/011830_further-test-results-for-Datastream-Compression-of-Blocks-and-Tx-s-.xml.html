    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The term "compression ratio" refers to the ratio of compressed to uncompressed data. For example, a 1 kB file compressed with a 10% compression ratio would be 0.1 kB. However, it seems that the term is being misused to refer to size reduction instead. In this case, a compressed file with a 10% reduction in size would actually be 0.9 kB.A message posted on November 28, 2015 by Peter Tschipper via bitcoin-dev presents data on the compression ratios achieved by various methods. The results show that Zlib is the most effective at compressing data, with LZOx-999 coming in close behind but at a cost. The data is presented in a table that breaks down the compression ratios achieved for different ranges of file sizes. The table shows that for files between 0-250b and 250-500b, Zlib-1 and Zlib-6 achieve the highest compression ratios, respectively. LZOx-1 and LZOx-999 achieve lower compression ratios than Zlib across all ranges of file sizes.</p>
