    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made for a simple URI scheme for blockchain exploration in Bitcoin. The motivation behind the proposal is to enable users to handle all requests for details about blocks, transactions, and addresses on a blockchain explorer with their preferred tool - whether that be a web service or local application. Currently, Bitcoin clients usually point to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when a user searches for transaction details. The same applies to posts and messages that reference particular transactions or blocks. The proposed URI follows a simple form: blockchain:<unique identifier>. Examples of this include blockchain:00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198 and blockchain:001949. Blockchain explorers can apply the same disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search box. Using this scheme means wallet developers (or other tools that need to show any kind of blockchain references) can simply make a blockchain link without having to worry about specific blockchain explorers or provide a means for the user to select one. Blockchain explorers in turn will offer to handle the blockchain: URI the first time the user visits their website, launch/install the application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one. Finally, users get the convenience of always using their preferred explorer, which can be particularly useful on mobile devices where cut-and-paste is less than ideal.</p>
