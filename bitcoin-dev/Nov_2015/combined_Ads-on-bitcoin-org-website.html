        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of a recent post on Bitcoin.org has expressed concerns about the site's neutrality, stating that it is essential to maintain an unbiased platform for information on bitcoin, its applications, and exchanges. The author criticizes the recent merge of a pull request (PR) that would allow Google Analytics on the site, claiming that this goes against the "who is in charge of bitcoin" rules and violates the bitcoin "philosophy." Furthermore, another PR not yet merged would enable ads on the site, which the author argues would attack the neutrality model of Bitcoin.org.The author questions how changes on Bitcoin.org occur, asking whether they follow consensus-agreement among contributors or if a group of people decides what to merge and what not to merge. Additionally, the author suggests that if site operators or contributors need to be paid for their work or pay for infrastructure, the root problem should be addressed, and funds should be raised for such purposes. The author offers help to speak to bitcoin businesses and individuals for fundraising.A concern was raised about the future of Bitcoin.org by Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev, as Bitcoin.org hosts the Bitcoin Core binaries referred to in release announcements. However, it was suggested that questions about how Bitcoin.org operates are best asked on bitcoin-discuss, and issues about advertising are best addressed in the PRs referenced. Dave, one of the Bitcoin.org maintainers, provided suggestions which included being on bitcoin-discuss to ask any questions, opening a GitHub issue to discuss advertising on Bitcoin.org, and discussing moving the Bitcoin Core binaries somewhere else if there is general dissatisfaction about advertisements being added to Bitcoin.org. Links to bitcoin-discuss and the GitHub issue were also provided.</p>
