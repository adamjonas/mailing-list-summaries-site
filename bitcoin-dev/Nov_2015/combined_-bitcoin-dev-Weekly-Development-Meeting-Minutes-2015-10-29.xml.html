        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On October 29, 2015, the #bitcoin-dev Weekly Development Meeting took place from 19:00-20:00 UTC. There were many attendees, including dstadulis, morcos, sipa, jgarzik, rusty, warren, jeremyrubin, evoskuil, Luke-Jr, dcousens, gmaxwell, jtimon, mcelrath, and btcdrak. The meeting covered various topics, such as the upcoming softfork, chain limits agreement status, backporting policy, leveldb replacement, clang format, BIP-68, and BIP-112.During the meeting, discussions about the upcoming softfork were held, including talks on solely CLTV with Morcos, Petertodd, and Dcousens, as well as coordination with other clients. The Chain Limits Agreement Status was also debated, and there were discussions on what should be sufficient consensus for merges. Backporting Policy was talked about during the meeting as well.Leveldb Replacement was discussed, and considerations were given to when code is abstracted and allows for testing. Alternative implementations exist, and testing was encouraged, although no future moves are planned at this time. Clang format history review was done during the meeting, and it was proposed a while ago to clang-format file set. It was recommended to maintain those files' formatting with automation (git hook checks or whatnot), as Clang format behavior changes "randomly" from version to version.The meeting also featured discussions on BIP-68 regarding “Mempool-only sequence number constraint verification” Implementation PR #6312, with concerns raised regarding skipping missing inputs. BIP-112: Mempool-only CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY PR #6564 was also discussed.At the end of the meeting, action items were assigned to responsible parties, such as Morcos reporting chain stats and sipa and Rusty reviewing BIP68 implementation #6312. IRC Chat Logs, Meetingbot Minutes in HTML and text format, and IRC Log are available for further reference.</p>
