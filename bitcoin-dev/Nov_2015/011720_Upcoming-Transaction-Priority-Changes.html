    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the mining policy and the ability of people to place priority-based transactions in a limited mempool world. The major issue with the mining policy is ensuring that the logic does not break in future changes, and there are many things that need to be updated in the right order when blocks are connected or disconnected. The ease of implementation of the mining code using starting priority is being discussed, with some suggesting it should be optional. However, it has been noted that maintaining the current priority algorithm is not expensive, so there is no point in using starting priority. Additionally, changing the default block priority size to 0 would not be helpful, as priority is the best metric for ensuring legitimate transactions get mined despite spam attacks. Overall, the discussion centers around finding the right balance between maintaining the mining policy while also preserving the ability of people to place priority-based transactions.</p>
