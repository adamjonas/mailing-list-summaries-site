    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Jorge Timón and Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev, Matt Corallo suggested that mining code should use starting priority for ease of implementation. However, Luke Dashjr argued that it should be optional, at least for 0.12. To this, Jorge Timón replied that maintaining the current priority algorithm is not even expensive. He believes that his goal in this matter will be to review #6357 in depth to be merged, and follow up with #6898 based on the current default policies. Regarding the default block priority size, Luke Dashjr objected to changing defaults, stating that it could influence miner policy. However, it was supposed to signal deprecation of the policy option. Luke further stated that priority is the best metric they have right now for ensuring legitimate transactions get mined despite spam attacks.</p>
