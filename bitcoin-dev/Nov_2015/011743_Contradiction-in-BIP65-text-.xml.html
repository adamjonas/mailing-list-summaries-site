    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeff Garzik responds to concerns about the language used in BIP65, which refers to the ability to "freeze" funds. He clarifies that users themselves can choose to freeze their own funds, rather than it being an act of force. The main point of confusion seems to be people's misunderstanding of how scriptpubkeys work. Some believe that wallets will display all available funds, but this is not the case - wallets will only display funds paid to scriptpubkeys they generated or would have generated. This ensures that no one can create a multisig and then claw back coins after they have been paid. Therefore, there is no risk of anyone sneaking in CLTV locked funds for you except through software bugs, which would likely cause other problems first.</p>
