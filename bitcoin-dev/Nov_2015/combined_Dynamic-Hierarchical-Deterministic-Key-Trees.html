        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In November 2015, Eric Lombrozo submitted a BIP proposal to address the issue of HD wallet structures in Bitcoin. The goal of the proposal was to simplify multidevice synchronization, key management, and account structures by generating signing key sequences from easily backupable and shareable seeds. This would allow for easier use of HD wallets while also maintaining privacy by making it difficult to associate transactions with an account without knowing the seed/chain code.During the discussion on the proposal, Tamas Blummer asked if it was possible to use a key both for signing and for deriving a deeper level of the hierarchy. However, Eric did not provide any arguments discouraging this use.In response to Tamas' question, Eric mentioned that he had submitted a BIP proposal that specifically addressed the issue of needing to predefine HD wallet structures and not being able to arbitrarily nest deeper levels. The proposal can be found on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/242)">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/242)</a>. Although Eric did not directly answer Tamas' question about discouraging the use of a key for both signing and deriving a deeper level of the hierarchy, his submission of the BIP proposal indicates that he is seeking solutions to expand the capabilities of HD wallets in Bitcoin.Eric, a developer, has invited public comments and feedback on the BIP proposal on GitHub. This open invitation allows for further development and refinement of the proposed solution to the limitations posed by the current structure of HD wallets in Bitcoin.</p>
