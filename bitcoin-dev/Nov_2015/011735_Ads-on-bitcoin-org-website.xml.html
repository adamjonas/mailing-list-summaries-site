    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A concern was raised about the future of Bitcoin.org by Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev. As Bitcoin.org hosts the Bitcoin Core binaries referred to in release announcements, this subject is conceivably on-topic for bitcoin-dev. However, it was suggested that questions about how Bitcoin.org operates are best asked on bitcoin-discuss and issues about advertising are best addressed in the PRs referenced. Dave, one of the Bitcoin.org maintainers, provided suggestions which included being on bitcoin-discuss to ask any questions, opening a GitHub issue to discuss advertising on Bitcoin.org, and discussing moving the Bitcoin Core binaries somewhere else if there is general dissatisfaction about advertisements being added to Bitcoin.org. Links to bitcoin-discuss and the GitHub issue were also provided.</p>
