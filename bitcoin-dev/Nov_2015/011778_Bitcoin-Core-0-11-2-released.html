    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the verification of gpg keys for Bitcoin Core binary release. The writer cautions against copy/pasting from web pages as it could lead to potential false negatives due to padding/character set conversion issues. To verify the mails, the original mail needs to be verified which archives don't make easy or even possible. Instead, the writer recommends verifying the binary release signing key which is signed by a normal key and both keys can be found on the bitcoin.org download page.The context also highlights the release of Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2 and provides information about its upgrade and downgrade. One significant change is the implementation of BIP113, which enforces the rule that blocks must not contain transactions with locktimes more than two hours in the future. This is intended to prevent miners from producing invalid blocks if/when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Another improvement in this release is the fix for the corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns in Windows. The new release also includes several other changes, including enabling CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as a standard script verify flag, adding BIP65 to getblockchaininfo softforks list, and making CScriptNum() take nMaxNumSize as an argument. The full list of changes can be found in the 0.11.2 Change log. The context also discusses Kleopatra's invalid signature issue and believes that something went wrong with the email system. The implication for users is that GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves forward. Users should subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from their locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at approximately the expected time.The new release of Bitcoin Core was made possible by contributions from a number of individuals, including Alex Morcos, à¸¿tcDrak, Chris Kleeschulte, Daniel Cousens, Diego Viola, Eric Lombrozo, Esteban Ordano, Gregory Maxwell, Luke Dashjr, Marco Falke, Mark Friedenbach, Matt Corallo, Micha, Mitchell Cash, Peter Todd, Pieter Wuille, Wladimir J. van der Laan, and Zak Wilcox. Additionally, there were many who contributed additional code review and/or security research, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.</p>
