    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was initiated on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the threshold of reasonableness for OP_CAT scripts, which require terabytes of RAM to validate. The concern was raised about whether there are any such scripts currently in the unspent transaction output (utxo) set, which is worth approximately $5 billion. It was argued that it is easier to justify the position of not changing the meaning of someone else's outputs rather than having a small group of people decide what's standard and nonstandard. The question was posed about how close Bitcoin developers want to sail towards being administrators of a virtual currency. The email also contained two non-text attachments: 0xEAD9E623.asc and signature.asc.</p>
