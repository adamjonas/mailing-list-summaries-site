    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Justus Ranvier raised the question of whether there are any OP_CAT scripts currently in the UTXO set. It was suggested that locked transactions could pay to an OP_CAT script with the private key being lost, and even if it is only in theory, it is still worth trying to prevent rule changes which permanently prevent outputs being spendable. However, it is easier to justify the position that nobody has the right to change the meaning of someone else's outputs than it is to justify a small group of people deciding what is standard and denying access to money for non-standard use. If at least one year's notice was given, then people wouldn't lose their money, since they have notice. Locked transactions could have a different expectation than non-locked ones. Finally, it was discussed how close to the shores of "administrators of a virtual currency" do Bitcoin developers want to sail, and it was pointed out that miners can collectively vote to disable specific UTXOs and change the acceptance rules.</p>
