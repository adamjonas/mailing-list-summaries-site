    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the text attempted to certify Wladimir's PGP keys, starting with the old one (2346C9A6) and then proceeding to the new one (36C2E964) since it was signed with the old one. However, when he visited the website where the new key was referenced in a message signed by the old one, he found that the signature was bad, although the SHA256SUMS.asc file obtained from the magnet link posted in the same email verified using the new key. The email contained information about Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2, which is now available for download from <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/">https://bitcoin.org/bin/</a>. The update brings bug fixes, the BIP65 (CLTV) consensus change, and relay policy preparation for BIP113. It is highly recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.The release includes several changes related to the BIP65 soft fork, which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a specified point in the future. A soft fork has also been specified that weakens the perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast() greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block. Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for immediate inclusion in a block to be accepted into the mempool. This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions, so transactions whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will no longer be accepted into the mempool. Finally, the release fixes a Windows bug for corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns.In the previous version, Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1, bug fixes and performance improvements were included along with the BIP65 softfork. Other changes included a fix for locking in GetTransaction, new rules for using GetMedianTimePast as the endpoint for lock-time calculations, and the ability to mine on top of old tip blocks for testnet. The release also featured contributions from individuals such as Alex Morcos, Gregory Maxwell, and Wladimir J. van der Laan.</p>
