    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Michael Gr√∏nager claims that he is able to get a full blockchain from scratch in 45 minutes on his laptop. However, Steve, who has been doing extensive testing in this area, finds it difficult to believe and asks for additional information to help him with testing. Steve mentions that he has an extensive setup of test machines, ranging from e4300 to phenom2x6 to i5's, but it still takes him about 12-24 hours to get the entire chain. As an example, he states that on an amd e-450 with 4GB RAM and approx 3gb/s internet connection, it took him 2 hours to sync the last 5 days. He expresses his curiosity and requests Michael to provide any additional information that can help him with his testing. The context ends with a PGP signature.</p>
