    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is part of a discussion about the "clients" page on bitcoin.org. Alan Reiner, an alt-client developer, agrees with Greg, who has suggested randomizing the order of clients on the page. However, Reiner thinks that alt clients should still be easily accessible and suggests keeping the page as it is, with Bitcoin-Qt listed first. He acknowledges that gaining consensus among developers on how to organize the page would be difficult, and suggests having a "czar" who can make responsible decisions. Thomas adds his agreement that the 'clients' page is useful in clarifying the difference between the Bitcoin client and the Bitcoin protocol/network/ecosystem and contributes to showing the health of Bitcoin.</p>
