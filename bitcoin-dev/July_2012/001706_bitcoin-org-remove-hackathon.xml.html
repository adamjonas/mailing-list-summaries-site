    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on July 17th, 2012, Amir Taaki expressed his reluctance to sell speaker slots but acknowledged that it may become necessary in order to pay bills. He also stated that if such a situation were to arise, it would be made clear through scheduling and disclaimers that sponsored speakers were indeed sponsors.Taaki's email was in response to a discussion about the potential inclusion of sponsored speakers at events. While Taaki personally did not mind sponsored speakers, he believed that they should have somewhat relevant topics in order to prevent the event from becoming a "circlejerk."As an example, Taaki expressed interest in hearing about payments innovation outside of bitcoin. It is unclear whether or not sponsored speakers were ultimately included in the event in question.</p>
