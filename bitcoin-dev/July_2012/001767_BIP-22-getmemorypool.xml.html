    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki, a British-Iranian programmer and Bitcoin developer, shared a link to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0022 on July 30, 2012. The BIP is a technical document that outlines a proposed change or improvement to the Bitcoin network. The specific BIP in question relates to the "getwork" protocol used by Bitcoin miners to request new blocks to solve.Taaki also noted in his message that the Pooled Mining sections of the original BIP have been moved to a new location on the Bitcoin wiki, which he links to. He suggests that this updated version of the BIP just needs a number assigned to it to complete the process. This move was likely made to streamline and organize the information on the wiki for easier accessibility and understanding by developers and users alike.Overall, Taaki's message serves as a simple announcement regarding a change in the location of information related to Bitcoin mining, and provides a helpful link to the relevant BIP on the Bitcoin wiki.</p>
