        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this context, it is explained that OP_RESERVED is a NOP (no operation) and does not have any function. However, there is some ambiguity in its functionality, as CScript::IsPushOnly(...) counts it as a push operation. Despite this ambiguity, it is generally considered harmless.It is important to note that the use of OP_RESERVED is rare and not recommended in most cases. This is due to its lack of clear functionality and potential confusion with push operations. It is also mentioned that changes to the Bitcoin script language have made OP_RESERVED even less useful than before.Overall, while OP_RESERVED may technically exist within the Bitcoin script language, its usage and functionality are not well-defined or widely accepted. As such, it is generally best to avoid using it in favor of more clearly defined operations.</p>
