    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin clients' webpage had a source of disputes over the order in which clients were shown, so Amir Taaki made a change to randomly order them. Gregory Maxwell would have recommended leaving the reference client first and using JS randomization instead of jekyll for more even coverage. The argument that the other clients were not up to scratch held maybe a few months ago, but not now. Amir Taaki suggested removing the clients page, but Gregory Maxwell disagreed and said that Amir's bias towards thinking there should be only one Bitcoin client that everyone uses was the reason behind it. The other clients are becoming stable and mature, leading to diversification in the ecosystem. Removing the clients page is not necessary.</p>
