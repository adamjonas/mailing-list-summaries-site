    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion was made to avoid confusing or annoying users and preserve the ordering as much as possible on the clients page. The ordering helps users remember where they found a client they liked. One person suggested that entries on the page should be randomly ordered when the page is generated, and then regenerated every two days. This will give fair exposure to all the clients listed. Additionally, there was information shared about an upcoming exclusive live event covering all the ways today's security and threat landscape has changed and how IT managers can respond. Discussions will include endpoint security, mobile security, and the latest in malware threats. Finally, there was a link provided to a Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
