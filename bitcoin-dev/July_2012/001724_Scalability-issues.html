    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation begins with a user suggesting that there is something wrong with the software stack of the other person's system. However, the person denies any issues and claims that it is all default install. They also mention that they have documented the platform for anyone who wants to confirm it. The discussion then moves on to the time taken for a full sync, with one person claiming that it takes an hour while the other stating that it takes only 5 seconds on their Cray system. The topic of using Tor is also brought up, with one person guessing that the blockchain download is being run through the tor-proxy. However, the other person claims that Tor is fast enough and can copy the entire 3GiB of the .bitcoin dir in 7 days off a slow hidden service and 0.5 days via exit. Encryption is also discussed, with one person claiming that encrypting the disk will not help much, while the other person argues that encryption is reasonable to expect users of bitcoin to be interested in doing. The discussion then moves on to the storage of a public blockchain and whether it is odd to encrypt it. It is argued that without detachdb, it is somehow tied to the wallet and that encrypting everything is perfectly reasonable. The use of ZFS/BTRFS is also mentioned as they verify the integrity of their data on disk. Finally, the conversation ends with one person claiming that they can get a full blockchain from scratch in 45 minutes on their laptop, but the other person argues that timings are useless without CPU/OS/disk specs.</p>
