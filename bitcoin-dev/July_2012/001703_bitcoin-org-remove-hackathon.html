    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on July 16, 2012, Jeff Garzik suggested that a hackathon might be appropriate for bitcoin.org as it is focused on dev-related activities. While he didn't object to the conference being included on the site, he believed that the site was more community-focused and wanted to know how often developers used it compared to GitHub. In response to someone else suggesting Bitcoin Magazine be included, Garzik proposed that for-profit organizations should be asked to pitch in some way or another, but wasn't sure who should organize it. He also suggested that if Amir Taaki's Bitcoin Consultancy was behind the conference, their development contributions should be sufficient. Finally, he concluded that this discussion would be better suited for a pull request than email.</p>
