    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The data shared on GitHub by Jeff Garzik, exMULTI, Inc., provides a count of how many times each opcode was used in the blockchain. The data is presented in an organized chart which lists all opcodes and their corresponding count numbers. Overall, there were 26 different opcodes used in the blockchain. The highest frequency of use was for OP_CHECKSIG with a count of 12,188,693, followed by OP_DUP with a count of 11,699,991. While some opcodes such as OP_4 and OP_NOP1 had minimal use, others like OP_PUSHDATA had a count of 32,350,369. In addition to the data, Jeff Garzik also mentions his association with exMULTI, Inc. and provides his email address for further communication.</p>
