    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jeff Garzik and Gregory Maxwell, they discuss the creation of a controversial page. Maxwell mentions that if the change had been proposed as a pull request, he would have recommended leaving it so that the reference client was always first and using JS randomization instead of jekyll to get more even coverage. They both agree that pull requests are necessary for non-trivial changes and that this controversial change should have been submitted as one. Furthermore, some people were concerned about the creation of this page, fearing it would lead to useless disputes. The cost of dealing with the page is starting to exceed the benefit it provides, and they suggest removing it.</p>
