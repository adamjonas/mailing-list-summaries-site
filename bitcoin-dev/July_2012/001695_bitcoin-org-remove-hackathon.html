    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The request is to remove the hackathon event from bitcoin.org and replace it with a conference. It is unclear what conference is being referred to. The website bitcoin.org serves as a source of information for users interested in Bitcoin and its related events. The hackathon event is typically an event where developers come together to work on projects related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The decision to remove the hackathon event and replace it with a conference would depend on the purpose and goals of the website. If the website is focused on providing information about Bitcoin development and innovation, then the hackathon event may be more appropriate. However, if the website is geared towards educating and informing users about the broader aspects of Bitcoin such as investment and adoption, then a conference may be more suitable.It is important to note that any changes made to the website should be done carefully and with consideration of the impact on the user experience. Additionally, it may be helpful to consult with other members of the Bitcoin community or experts in the field before making any significant changes to the website.</p>
