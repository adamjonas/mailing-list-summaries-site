        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows instant payments to anyone in the world. It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.To use Bitcoin, one must download a wallet program to their computer or mobile device. There are various wallet programs available with different features and security measures, such as Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and Armory. Bitcoins can be obtained through buying from an exchange, receiving them as payment for goods or services, or mining using computer processing power.Users can send and receive bitcoins to others around the world without intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Transactions are typically processed within minutes and are irreversible once confirmed by the network. Bitcoin offers a fast, secure, and decentralized way to transfer value globally, making it a popular choice for individuals seeking financial autonomy and privacy due to its open-source nature and lack of central authority.</p>
