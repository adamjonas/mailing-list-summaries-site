    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the context has encountered an issue where social networks do not parse QRcodes because they do not recognize URLs without "://" in them. The person responsible for fixing this, Ben, stopped responding to emails after the explanation. As a result, the author has added support for reading these types of URLs to bitcoinj for interoperability purposes. The author warns others who may want to do the same thing, as it goes against BIP compliance and is a temporary solution until Ben stops generating such QRcodes. However, the author expresses concern over the "accept everything even if broken" approach, as it creates a fragmented de-facto standard. While the author does not oppose accepting broken URLs, there should be a promise that they will be fixed at the source.</p>
