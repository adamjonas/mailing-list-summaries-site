    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the difficulty in choosing an XMPP client and how a wiki may be more useful than the current system. The current system, found on xmpp.org, is criticized for not attempting to list features or differentiating aspects of each client. Despite being more up-to-date and in touch with users, a wiki may not reflect the needs of average people. The inability to agree on columns is not why the current client page looks the way it does. A short piece of text is considered easier to communicate differences to people. Popular options such as BlockChain.info and MtGox are not mentioned at all. It is agreed that risk isn't purely about how something is implemented and that track record counts for a lot as well.</p>
