    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the conversation is about shopping and spending, even with an incomplete blockchain. The person questioned why there was a need to encrypt 2+ GB of public record. In response, the other person explained that they couldn't find an option to split the wallet, debug log, and other private information from the blockchain. Additionally, encrypting everything is considered standard practice. They also referenced Cardinal Richelieu's disputed quote on this matter.The conversation then shifted to the time spent attempting to crunch the most recent 3100 blocks before being overrun with new ones and retired. According to the logs for the box, at least 9 days were spent on this task, although there was no formal start timestamp available.</p>
