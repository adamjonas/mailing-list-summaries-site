    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community has been informed that blockchain.info, as well as its iPhone app, generate non-BIP-compliant URIs in its QR codes. The URIs are in the format of bitcoin://address rather than the compliant form of bitcoin:address. The issue was brought to Ben's attention, but it was not resolved. In order to ensure interoperability, support for reading these types of URLs were added to bitcoinj. The email is a heads up for anyone else who wants to do the same thing. However, it is hoped that blockchain.info will stop generating such QR codes and the hacks can be removed to get back to BIP compliance.</p>
