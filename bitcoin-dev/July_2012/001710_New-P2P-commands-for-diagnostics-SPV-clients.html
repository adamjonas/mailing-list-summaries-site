    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this piece suggests that filters could benefit from having exact matches in addition to Bloom filters. This would be particularly useful for systems interested in transactions relevant to specific markers or identifiers, such as a "BOND" 2DROP tag. The proposed algorithm involves checking the hash of a transaction, as well as each input and output against the filter to determine if there is a match. By adding the hash of a matching transaction to a parallel Bloom filter, any future transactions connected to it can also be easily identified. It should be noted that the current spec provided by Jeff does not specify how filters are matched against transactions.</p>
