    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2012, a discussion was held regarding a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) being split into three separate proposals. Amir Taaki received a request from Luke-jr to do so because other developers felt that the original proposal was too unfocused and covered too many topics. The discussion took place on a mailing list, not IRC, though it took some prompting on IRC to get Luke-jr to move in the direction of breaking up the proposal. Pieter had objected to certain optional parts of the spec, and breaking it up would allow those parts to be removed. It was suggested that further discussion could be held if anyone else had objections or missed the original discussion.</p>
