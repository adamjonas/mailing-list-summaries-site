    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-development mailing list had a discussion about broken URLs and the need for adherence to BIP compliance. Andreas Schildbach shared that he had asked Ben to fix the issue with generating QR codes without :// in them, but after Ben stopped responding, Schildbach went ahead and added support for reading these types of URLs to bitcoinj. Schildbach expressed concern that accepting broken URLs encourages people not to fix them, leading to a fragmented de facto standard. Gary Rowe suggested having more people email Ben to ask him politely to comply with BIP. Wladimir questioned whether Ben was the only one using broken URLs, as it seemed to be widespread already. The conversation emphasized the importance of maintaining BIP compliance and avoiding broken windows. The thread also included a link to an upcoming Live Security Virtual Conference discussing security and threat landscape changes and how IT managers can respond.</p>
