    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and an unknown individual on July 6, 2012, they discuss issues related to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 30. The individual suggests that the issues with duplication in BIP 30 could be solved through non-backwards incompatible means, such as mandating that a refers to the first unspent pair. This was essentially what BIP 30 did. However, it's important to note that BIP 30 doesn't prevent duplication, but only prevents the identified "really evil outcome" of duplication.There was also discussion about doing the height before the BIP 30 change, but the realization that rewrites were a vulnerability made it urgent to roll out the BIP 30 change more quickly. Rolling out the height would require more time.</p>
