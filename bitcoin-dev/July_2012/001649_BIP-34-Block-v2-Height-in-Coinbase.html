    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 6, 2012, a discussion took place between Jeff Garzik and Peter Vessenes about a proposal to add the block height to the coinbase of Bitcoin blocks. Vessenes questioned why this change was necessary and expressed concern about adding too many requirements to the coinbase. Garzik argued that without adding the block height to the coinbase, there could be issues with unique transactions. However, another participant in the discussion suggested that these issues could be solved through non-backwards incompatible means, such as mandating that a transaction refers to the first pair that is not already spent.</p>
