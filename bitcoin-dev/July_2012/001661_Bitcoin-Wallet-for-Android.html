    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated July 9, 2012, Gregory Maxwell expressed his concerns and actions regarding some additions made to a page. He removed the proprietary software section, a plug for blockchain.info webservices, and demoted the armory client. However, he left the android software because its source was available and had been reviewed. Maxwell also stated his criteria for listing software on the page. He believed that anything with a security model weaker than SPV should not be listed unless users could operate their own servers. Furthermore, only thin clients with a near SPV security model should be included in the list. If a server component is present in thin clients, it should be subjected to independent review. In the future, actual evidence of third-party review should exist for any software to be listed on the page.</p>
