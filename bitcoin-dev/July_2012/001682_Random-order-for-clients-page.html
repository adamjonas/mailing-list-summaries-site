    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this email suggests that moving the project to a wiki would be a better option as it allows anyone to update information and is more up-to-date. The editing discussions include users, making it more user-oriented. The author argues that wikis are recognizable as community-generated and fallible. In contrast, Github-based pages tend to be dominated by developers. The current client page is an example of how internal politics can create issues. The author believes that a UI or product created as a result of internal politics spells doom for any product. The author suggests that it makes sense for bitcoin.org to educate users about the system and all available options. They argue that random changes to the website should not be allowed and disputes should be resolved by a sole committer who has a focus on regular people and their needs.</p>
