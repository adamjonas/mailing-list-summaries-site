    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the format of the Bitcoin client page and the best way to display information about clients for new users. There was some debate about whether a feature matrix or prose would be better. A well-designed feature matrix can be user-friendly but may not be appropriate for the Bitcoin.org site. The XMPP website was cited as an example of a poorly designed listing, which only provided walls of text. It was suggested that a wiki might be a better option because it is more up-to-date and in touch with users. However, there was concern that a wiki would only attract geeks who understand wiki syntax and wouldn't reflect the needs of the average person. The current design of the Bitcoin client page was explained, which uses short pieces of text to communicate differences between clients rather than a feature matrix. The importance of track record for end users was also discussed.</p>
