        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2012, a discussion was held to split a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) into three separate proposals. Amir Taaki received a request from Luke-jr to do so because other developers felt that the original proposal was too unfocused and covered too many topics. The discussion took place on a mailing list, not IRC, though it took some prompting on IRC to get Luke-jr to move in the direction of breaking up the proposal. Pieter had objected to certain optional parts of the spec, and breaking it up would allow those parts to be removed. It was suggested that further discussion could be held if anyone else had objections or missed the original discussion.Amir Taaki, a British-Iranian programmer and Bitcoin developer, shared a link to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0022 on July 30, 2012. The BIP is a technical document that outlines a proposed change or improvement to the Bitcoin network. The specific BIP in question relates to the "getwork" protocol used by Bitcoin miners to request new blocks to solve. Taaki also noted in his message that the Pooled Mining sections of the original BIP have been moved to a new location on the Bitcoin wiki, which he links to. He suggests that this updated version of the BIP just needs a number assigned to it to complete the process. This move was likely made to streamline and organize the information on the wiki for easier accessibility and understanding by developers and users alike.The author of the message is seeking input from others regarding a proposal to split BIP 22 into three separate proposals, due to concerns about the original BIP being too unfocused and covering too many topics. The author acknowledges that this discussion took place on IRC rather than the mailing list as specified in BIP 1. The author is unsure if there was any discussion of BIP 22 on the mailing list, but seeks input before granting permission for the proposal to be pared down. The author admits to having limited knowledge of mining and invites others to share their thoughts on the proposed split. The link provided points to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 22 on the Bitcoin wiki.</p>
