    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki informed the Bitcoin community that the entries on the clients page were randomly ordered when the page was generated. He suggested regenerating the page every two days to provide fair exposure to all clients listed. However, if he had authored it as a pull request, leaving the reference client first would have been recommended. JS randomization could be used instead of Jekyll for more even coverage. There were concerns that the page would cause disputes. It appears that this has become the case and the cost of dealing with the page is starting to exceed its benefits. Therefore, it may be considered to remove it.</p>
