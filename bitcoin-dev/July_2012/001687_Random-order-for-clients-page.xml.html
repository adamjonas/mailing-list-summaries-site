    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Stefan Thomas discusses the effectiveness of feature matrices for new users when it comes to making a decision. He argues that these matrices can be unhelpful and confusing for those who are not developers or technologically inclined. However, he acknowledges that a well-designed feature matrix can be user-friendly and useful. He points to Apple's iPod comparison page as an example of a successful feature matrix. Thomas suggests that while prose is better for getting a sense of a client's philosophy, a feature matrix can quickly identify specific features or criteria without having to read through all the text. He proposes that a feature matrix could be a useful addition to the Bitcoin wiki page. In response, another individual suggests that the feature matrix should be linked from the clients page, but not included on the main page due to its potential confusion for new users. They propose adding a link with the text "Compare features of the various different clients here:" to allow interested users to easily access the matrix.</p>
