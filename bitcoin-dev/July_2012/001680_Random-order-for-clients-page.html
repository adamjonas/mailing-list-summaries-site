    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community discusses the idea of having a randomised client page on Bitcoin.org. Alan Reiner expresses his disagreement with the idea, stating that it is not fair for users to have an inconsistent page that sometimes recommends less-developed solutions. Instead, he suggests that a subjective list be created by someone trusted to understand what is good for users and who has familiarity with the programs. Gregory Maxwell reveals that the original layout was not accidental and Jim admits that he was secretly pleased with MultiBit's position on the page. It is suggested that directing people to other clients can improve the user experience as not everyone wants a 2.5Gb+ download before starting out on their Bitcoin adventure. The alternative clients are acknowledged and promoted in order to further the idea that Bitcoin is more than just the reference client.</p>
