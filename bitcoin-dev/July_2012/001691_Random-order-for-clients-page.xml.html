    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the best way to present a list of Bitcoin clients on bitcoin.org in a manner that would be most beneficial to users. The author suggests that a page listing major and vetted clients should be created rather than relegating it to a wiki page which may contain marginal or low-quality clients. The list of clients should be ordered based on “goodness” determined by whoever is put in charge of the page, with goodness being a weighted average of features, security, and goodness for the Bitcoin network. Randomized order is not recommended, but if chosen, it should be done client-side using JavaScript to avoid daily page reorganization. The author suggests combining prose descriptions and feature matrices to give users a better idea of each client's strengths and weaknesses. Prose descriptions should include negative points, while categories for the feature matrix should be carefully chosen and well-defined. If targeting users who "don't know what they're doing," a decision assistant setup could help by recommending clients based on user answers to several questions. The author concludes that resolving this issue should not require disproportionate developer resources and suggests leaving the page as is, adding negative points to prose, and linking to the wiki clients list, which could be completed in an hour. The author also provides references to research supporting their suggestions. Overall, the author recommends creating a page listing major and vetted Bitcoin clients, ordering them based on a weighted average of features, security, and goodness for the network, and including both prose descriptions and feature matrices with well-defined categories. A decision assistant setup could also be helpful for inexperienced users.</p>
