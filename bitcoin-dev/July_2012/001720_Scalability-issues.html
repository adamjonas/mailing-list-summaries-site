    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has expressed concerns over the scalability of Bitcoin, stating that by the end of the year it will completely overrun the capabilities of machines such as a Pentium 4 1.8GHz single core with 2GB RAM and FreeBSD 8. The machine is running Bitcoin 0.6.3, Tor proxy, and has workstation duties, yet even if those were removed it would still struggle by mid-2013. It currently takes a month to build a new blockchain, let alone keep up with incoming blocks. The user can expect scalability hurdles in the future, particularly if they want to independently build, manage, and trust their own blockchain. The post also includes an advertisement for a Live Security Virtual Conference covering IT security and malware threats.</p>
