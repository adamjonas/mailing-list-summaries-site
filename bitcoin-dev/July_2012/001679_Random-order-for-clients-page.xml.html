    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of randomization and fairness in deciding which Bitcoin client should be displayed first on the main page of Bitcoin.org. While randomization may seem fair, it does not necessarily represent what is best for the users in the community. The notion of having a page that is "fair for developers" is flawed as it could lead to the inclusion of new projects with substantial issues/bugs. It is suggested that someone who understands what is good for users and has familiarity with the programs should be the one to decide. This person can take input from others but ultimately make the decision based on their interpretation of what's best for Bitcoin.org users. In this way, important discussions can be saved for more pressing matters. The current ordering of clients on the main page was not accidental, as stated by Gregory Maxwell.</p>
