        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gavin Andresen initiated a discussion in 2012 regarding the porting of tests into data-driven format. He suggested porting P2SH, checksig, checkmultisig, block verification and DoS rules tests. Gavin was interested in helping with the process if pull requests were welcome. He also mentioned that more tests are always welcome. However, check*sig tests were tricky as they required referring to previous unspent transactions and private keys which implied testing against a particular block chain. Suggestions on a simple data-driven format were welcome.In response to Gavin's suggestion, Matt wrote a simple block chain tester capable of forking, checking invalid blocks, and sanity-testing reorgs. It was part of the bitcoinj test suite and targeted at testing bitcoinj directly. The bitcoinj test suite was lightweight, so some tweaks would be required for it to be more generic. The tester had only a few test cases yet but could be used for regression testing.Pieter responded to Gavin's query about check*sig tests by suggesting using a memory-backed coin set as state with the list of coins and blocks loaded from a file. He explained that Ultraprune changes the block validation mechanism to use only a set of coins and the latest block pointer as state, represented by an abstract class with several implementations.</p>
