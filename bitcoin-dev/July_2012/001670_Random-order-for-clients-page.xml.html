    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Amir Taaki and another individual, Amir expressed his belief that JS randomization is bad and that people shouldn't need JS to view a webpage. The other individual argued that JS randomization doesn't imply needing JS to view the page but rather needing it to see the page in a random order. They also suggested combining server-side randomization, though they didn't believe it was necessary.The conversation then turned to changes made on a Bitcoin clients webpage and whether or not they were fair and equal. Amir argued that he supported diversity in the Bitcoin network and had encouraged alternative client developers to become more complete software. However, he believed that until something changes, the reference client needs to be the option they lead with, as the network would be non-functional if it consisted entirely of alternative clients. Amir liked the idea of moving the information regarding clients to the Wiki, as there is less expectation for vetting on the Wiki, which already contains questionable and sometimes contradictory advice. Overall, the conversation touched on issues related to JS randomization, fairness and equality in Bitcoin clients, and the importance of diversity in the Bitcoin network.</p>
