    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The importance of the clients page is emphasised as it contributes significantly to Bitcoin's growth. The author argues that Bitcoin.org should remain a neutral resource for the community, and suggests that removing the page would go against this goal. They suggest instead that the page be kept with a neutral overview of the main clients. If the page is to be removed, the author proposes a vote involving several individuals. The author encourages trying out new clients such as Electrum, MultiBit, and Bitcoin Wallet for Android. They argue that these clients are well-written and more secure than Bitcoin-Qt. However, they also note that the Bitcoin network could still function with Electrum nodes and miners.Regarding the randomisation of entries on the clients page, the author claims that it now achieves its intended effect, as the page is regenerated daily. They suggest that there is no need for argument as long as the page remains neutral and covers negative aspects of each client.Finally, the author clarifies that their intention is not to remove alternative clients, as they strongly support diversity in the Bitcoin network. They propose moving the clients page to the Wiki, where there is less expectation that placement implies any vetting. However, the author believes that until something changes, the reference client needs to be the option leading the way.</p>
