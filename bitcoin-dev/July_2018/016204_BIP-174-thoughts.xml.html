    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion surrounding the Bitcoin wallet standard, Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT), contributors debated whether or not to allow combiners to choose any value in cases of conflicts within the transaction. Concerns were raised that conflicts in certain fields could be at best a recoverable error and at worst malicious activity, making it generally safer to default to rejecting conflicts, and explicitly allowing the Combiner to process them intelligently if it understands the relevant fields. There was also discussion around signing records with unknown keys, with some suggesting that a flag bit indicating "Don't sign if you don't understand this" could be added as a future extension. However, others argued that it would be safer to consider this flag be on by default and leave it for a future extension to allow non-mandatory fields.</p>
