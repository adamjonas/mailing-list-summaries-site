    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In Haskell libraries, it is a common practice to use the prefix "unsafe" for functions that may have side effects. This serves as a warning for programmers to be cautious while using these functions. However, there is a suggestion to use a different approach by adding a "_VULNERABLE" or "_UNSAFE" postfix to signal the potential danger of these functions.This alternative approach would provide a more clear and standardized way of indicating the possibility of side effects in a function. It would also make it easier for developers to identify and avoid using such functions if possible.It is important to note that the use of unsafe functions should be minimized as much as possible in order to reduce the risk of bugs and other issues. Programmers should always prioritize safety and reliability when writing code, especially in situations where the consequences of failure could be significant.Overall, the proposed use of a "_VULNERABLE" or "_UNSAFE" postfix represents a potentially useful convention that could help improve code quality and prevent unintended consequences. By adhering to this standard, developers can ensure that their code is both safe and effective, without sacrificing functionality or performance.</p>
