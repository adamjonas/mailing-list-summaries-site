    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new project has been launched that allows users to run their own Electrum server with minimal hardware resources, enabling them to keep track of their balances and transaction history in real-time. The server indexes the entire Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for fast queries for any given user wallet. By running on the user's machine, there is no need for the wallet to communicate with external Electrum servers, which helps preserve the privacy of the user's addresses and balances.The project supports the latest Electrum protocol and maintains an index of transaction inputs and outputs, allowing for fast balance queries. It also boasts a fast synchronization of the Bitcoin blockchain on modest hardware, low CPU and memory usage, efficient mempool tracker, and low index storage overhead. Additionally, it does not require `-txindex` for the Bitcoin node and uses a single RocksDB database for better consistency and crash recovery.The code and usage instructions can be found on GitHub, along with links to similar projects such as ElectrumX, Electrum Personal Server, and bitcoincore-indexd. Pull requests, suggestions, and questions are welcome. Overall, this project is expected to be useful for those looking to maintain their privacy while monitoring their Bitcoin transactions.</p>
