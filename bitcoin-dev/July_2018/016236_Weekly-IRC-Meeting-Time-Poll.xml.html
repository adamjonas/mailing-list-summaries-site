    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent email from Cory Fields to the bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2018 discussed a quick poll he put together to determine when developers are generally available for online meetings. He noted that this was off-topic for the bitcoin-dev mailing list, but many core developers were subscribed. The poll was designed to gather data on what times would work best for weekly IRC meetings in an effort to exclude fewer people. The polling began with an initial list of voters based on previous meeting participation and was set to conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19. Anyone who regularly attends the weekly meetings or could attend at a different time but did not receive a link to vote was requested to reply to the email or ping Cory on IRC so they could be added to the list.</p>
