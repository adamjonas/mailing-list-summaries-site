    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A bitcoin wallet is being developed that can handle "free pressure" properly, including CPFP awareness, transaction merging, automated progressive fee bumping, and more. However, there is no fee market on testnet, which is hindering progress. To address this issue, the suggestion was made to reduce the size of tesnet blocks so they don't mine the entire mempool each block. This change could be implemented by adjusting the default mining maxBlockWeight to 50% of the current mempool weight. While some miners may not use the new default, it would still be beneficial for testing and aiding wallet developers with fixing issues such as stuck transactions.</p>
