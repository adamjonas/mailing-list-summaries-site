    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.16.2 has been released with various bugfixes and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub. The new version is available for download from bitcoincore.org or through bittorrent. Upgrading to the new version is recommended, and instructions on how to upgrade are given in the release notes. The release notes also include a warning that wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16, and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this. Compatibility information is also included, stating that Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported, however, it should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.The change log for version 0.16.2 is detailed, including fixes for wallet issues, RPC and other APIs, GUI, build system, and tests and QA. Credits are given to everyone who directly contributed to this release, as well as those who reported security issues and helped with translations. A PGP signature is also provided for download.</p>
