    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A team of researchers have proposed a new Bitcoin transaction protocol called Dandelion, which they claim is a practical and lightweight privacy solution that provides users with formal anonymity guarantees. The protocol sends transactions over a randomly selected path before diffusion, preventing deanonymisation attacks by limiting the capability of adversaries to deanonymise the entire network. The team has completed additional theoretical analysis and simulations, built a working prototype and developed detailed documentation for the implementation. They have also addressed issues around routing during the stem phase, which is crucial to avoiding fingerprint attacks that could compromise anonymity. The team have released an updated BIP document with further details on motivation, specification, compatibility and implementation. However, they note that while Dandelion provides near-optimal anonymity guarantees among schemes that do not introduce additional encryption mechanisms, the probabilistic nature of the guarantees means that they are not absolute. As such, individuals who are worried about targeted deanonymisation should still use Tor. They also caution that any solution based only on routing cannot be absolute due to fundamental lower bounds on precision and recall.One commentator on the proposal asked for more information on the reasoning behind choosing the periodic route shuffling interval to be around 10 minutes, as there is a tradeoff between making intersection attacks possible by choosing too small an interval and making graph-learning attacks possible by choosing too large an interval. Another issue raised was whether adversaries could send a large number of transactions to selected peers in order to launch fingerprinting attacks on the selected peer by comparing the observed propagation of the transactions relayed through the peer to other transactions observed. Finally, there was some discussion around the difficulty of inferring Bitcoin's network topology, and the sensitivity of the adversary's precision and recall regarding imperfect topology knowledge.</p>
