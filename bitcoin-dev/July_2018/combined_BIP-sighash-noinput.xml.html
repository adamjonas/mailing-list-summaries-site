        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the implementation of NOINPUT and its potential impact on eltoo update scripts. One proposed modification to NOINPUT's implementation would allow for unilateral closes to be taprootifiable, but there are concerns regarding the potential risk involved in the use of NOINPUT. If the same key is used for multiple inputs and one of them is signed with NOINPUT, it could lead to a loss of all coins. There have been suggestions to drop support for SIGHASH_NONE or limit its usage similar to SIGHASH_NOINPUT. A new segwit version has also been proposed to include an opcode for NOINPUT or taproot, which allows distinguishing between addresses that use NOINPUT and those that don't. The discussion highlights the tradeoffs and risks involved in implementing NOINPUT and its impact on the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.The proposal of SIGHASH_NOINPUT for lightning v2 has raised concerns over the potential risks of cross-contaminating keys into the lightning subsystem. It was suggested that _NOINPUT be a flag to a signature for a hypothetical "OP_CHECK_SIG_FOR_SINGLE_USE_KEY" opcode instead, ensuring that a _NOINPUT signature is only valid for keys intended to be single use. An alternative approach is to encode normal signatures and _NOINPUT signatures in different addresses using a new opcode for _NOINPUT, as they are different intentions. However, implementing a new opcode would increase complexity in the code.Christian Decker proposed a new sighash flag, `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, that removes the commitment to the previous output. This approach is even more flexible as the script attached to the output being spent can change, without rendering the spending transaction invalid as long as the witness still ratifies a branch in the output's predicate. Peter Todd suggested that the formal name of this flag should be something like "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE" or "SIGHASH_WEAK_REPLAYABLE" because noinput is materially insecure for traditional applications where a third party might pay to an address a second time, and should only be used in special protocols which make that kind of mistake unlikely. He also expressed concern that wallets might start using this sighash without realizing the potential risks involved.</p>
