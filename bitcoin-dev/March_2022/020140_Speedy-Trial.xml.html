    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation began with @Aj suggesting steps to resolve a conflict, starting with talking to each other. Step 2 involved a futures market, which some individuals believed had selection bias, as it relied on the opinions/predictions of a small group of people willing to bet money. @jeremy suggested using a mechanism of soft-forking against activation. However, this was met with disagreement, and @jeremy went on to create a fork in 40 lines of python code. The email ended with a request for Jorge to vet the code carefully before running it.</p>
