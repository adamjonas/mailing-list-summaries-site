        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>BIP47, a protocol that can help improve privacy in Bitcoin transactions, has been discussed recently on Twitter. Prayank suggests using a newer version (v3 and v4) of BIP47 proposed on GitHub which eliminates the toxic change issue. Prayank explains how using an xpub does not provide anonymity as oneâ€™s payments can be identified if the xpub is shared with anyone, but using a payment code enables public association without revealing the payment identifier in the blockchain. Moreover, the author of an article proposes using TXT records and domains to address concerns about privacy and security. They suggest using GNS (GNU Name Service) to create a payment code for Alice, add it as a TXT record with an expiry date, and check it. They also recommend using `gnunet-publish` to replace notification transactions so users can receive donations without posting their bitcoin addresses on social media. The OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject has proposed a newer version of BIP47, v3 and v4 that addresses some issues from the previous version. The new version eliminates the toxic change issue by having the notification from Alice to Bob as a transaction from Alice to Alice as a bare 1 of 3 multisig, with the other two pubkeys representing Alice's payment code and Bob's payment identifier. This comes with a one-time overhead of 64 bytes for the two pubkeys, which would be amortized over the lifetime of the Alice/Bob relationship. Payment codes are recoverable from the bip32 seed without requiring extra backups. This new version is already in production with Samourai wallet. BIP47 v3 allows Alice to receive Bob's address without exposing her IP/identity to Charlie, who can watch Alice receive the payment code material from Bob without knowing if Alice acted by sending a payment to Bob. Using a payment code helps associate oneself publicly without revealing the payment code, which makes it difficult for anyone other than the sender to know if funds have been received.</p>
