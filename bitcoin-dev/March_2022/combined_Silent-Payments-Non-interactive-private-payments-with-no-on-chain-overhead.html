        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ruben Somsen proposed a new scheme called Silent Payments that allows recipients to generate a static address for private payments from anyone without requiring interaction or on-chain overhead. The recipient publishes their silent payment address, and the sender uses one of their chosen inputs to derive a shared secret, which is then used to tweak the silent payment address. The recipient detects the payment by scanning every transaction in the blockchain.Compared to previous schemes, Silent Payments avoids using the Bitcoin blockchain as a messaging layer and requires no interaction between sender and recipient. However, the main downsides are the scanning requirement, the lack of light client support, and the need to control your input(s). Several improvements have been made to the basic scheme, including UTXO set scanning, which limits the protocol to only scanning transactions that are part of the UTXO set when restoring from backup, making it faster. Another variant involves tweaking the silent payment address with the combination of all input keys of a transaction, which reduces the scanning cost but requires the cooperation of other participants if you want to combine your inputs with those of others.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has discussed the implementation of silent payments, which allows for private transactions without requiring a scanning process. One potential issue is input linkage, where coins from multiple inputs can be traced back to the sender. However, a blinding protocol exists that hides the silent payment address from other participants. Other protocols with similar functionality include Payment code sharing (BIP47), Xpub sharing, and Regular address sharing. Each has its tradeoffs, such as inefficiency and privacy leaks.Silent Payments offer better privacy but come with added complexity. A blinding protocol exists that hides the silent payment address from other participants, but the sender must control one of the inputs to be fully private. The article provides references to related articles and schemes and acknowledges the help of others in the development of these protocols. A tutorial for making silent payments on Signet has been created by woltx, which involves generating an address, publishing it, receiving and spending coins, and not showing transactions in a blockchain explorer. A user has thanked woltx for implementing silent payments in Bitcoin Core and confirmed that the steps provided in the tutorial work as expected. The user updated the silent payment address for their domain alice.silentbitco.in using a TXT record. They also added basic information about the silent payments proposal, implementation, and tutorial on their website silentbitco.in. The user did not face any issues with the performance of the UTXO Set and block scan but suggests that a new address/descriptor format would be a better approach instead of using flags.Ruben Somsen’s proposal provides fresh address generation and compatibility with one-time seed backups, offering a unique benefit of every address being automatically unique, eliminating the need for BIP32 HD keys and dealing with gap limits. However, the protocol requires scanning the entire Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, making it difficult to support light clients. The article compares Silent Payments with other protocols such as Payment Code Sharing, Xpub Sharing, and Regular Address Sharing, concluding that Silent Payments offer better privacy but come with added complexity.</p>
