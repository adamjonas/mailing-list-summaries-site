    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is centered around cross-input signature aggregation and its usefulness in Bitcoin. The writer notes that cross-input signature aggregation can be achieved with BLS signatures, but bundling both lisp and BLS support into one big glop may not be practical. The writer also provides an example of how multiple HTLCs could be claimed in a single transaction with common code for implementing HTLC across multiple protocols. However, this does not apply to current Bitcoin since they no longer accept a SCRIPT from the spender, but have a witness stack instead. The resistance to covenants and capabilities in the past has largely been around what would happen if you had opt-out covenants which acted as riders and could monkey around in later spends which were none of their business.</p>
