    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the issue of miner signaling being confused with voting in Bitcoin upgrades. While some believe that a better activation method, such as BIP 8/LOT=TRUE, could solve the problem, others argue that the narrative surrounding speedy trial needs to be explained more clearly to avoid confusion. One mining pool is cited as an example of those who still think miner signaling is voting. The idea of changing how Bitcoin is engineered for the sake of optics is opposed, and it is suggested that listing the advantages of a better activation method could help everyone understand the process better. The conversation continues with pushd discussing flaws in proposals making it through activation and the hashpower percentage being decided by Bitcoin core developers. The email concludes with pushd reiterating the need for better activation methods for future soft forks.</p>
