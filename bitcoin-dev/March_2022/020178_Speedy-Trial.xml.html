    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, a good idea has been proposed in the Bitcoin community which most of the community is enthusiastically supporting. However, there is an enemy of Bitcoin who is essentially alone in trying to stop it. Despite their incoherent raving, almost everyone remains enthusiastic about the idea. Nevertheless, the enemies of Bitcoin should have the power to stop this good idea.During the Taproot activation parameters meeting on February 16, 2021, participants expressed their preferences with regards to BIP 8's lockinontimeout (LOT) parameter. The reason for choosing BIP 8 is that it gives more power to users, and miners signaling is not considered voting, resulting in less politics and controversies. It is unclear how to determine whether someone is an enemy or not in step 2 and step 4. Additionally, there is a question about parallel lines meeting at infinity.</p>
