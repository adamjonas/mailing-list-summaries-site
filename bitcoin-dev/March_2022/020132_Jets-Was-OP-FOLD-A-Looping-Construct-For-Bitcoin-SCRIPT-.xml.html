    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the discussion between Billy and ZmnSCPxj, it was suggested that a cleanstack rule should be implemented, preventing scripts from validating if more than just a 'true' is left on the stack. Additionally, an even stronger cleanstack rule was mentioned where the stack and alt stack are completely empty. The critical mass needed for implementing new jets was also discussed, with the absolute minimum being two nodes supporting the jet for any benefit to occur. For example, a 22 byte script would break even when 10% of the network supports it, while a 102 byte script would break even when 2% of the network supports it. Finally, when discussing the implementation of a constants table, it was suggested that the table would be part of the SCRIPT puzzle and not in the witness solution.</p>
