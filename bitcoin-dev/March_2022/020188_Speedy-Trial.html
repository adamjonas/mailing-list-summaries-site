    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has been centered around the flaws in the speedy trial narrative. The claim that speedy trial can mislead users into thinking that miner signaling is how Bitcoin upgrades are voted in is considered the worst narrative. However, it is argued that the solution is not to change the engineering of soft forks but to provide better explanations of speedy trial to prevent misunderstandings.It is also noted that flawed proposals making it through activation is a failure of the review process. Although supermajority hash power percentage is decided by bitcoin core developers, they can choose not to follow old or new consensus rules at any point. Speedy trial is criticized for misleading many bitcoin users, including miners, into considering signaling as voting, which can lead to majority votes deciding if a soft fork gets activated.On the other hand, BIP 8/LOT=TRUE is seen as a simpler alternative. Miners need to follow consensus rules as they do right now if they wish to mine blocks for subsidy and fees. It is emphasized that mining pools or individual miners can participate in soft fork discussions regardless of activation method and share their concerns, which can be evaluated based on technical merits.</p>
