    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Anthony Towns and Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev revolves around a hypothetical scenario concerning the activation of forks in Bitcoin. Timón argues that if there were an evil fork, good people would oppose it, but Towns disagrees, saying that some people can make mistakes and be fooled. He also warns that any solution must deal with all hypothetical scenarios, not just the ones Timón wants to discuss. In particular, Towns is concerned about solutions that allow for blocking an evil fork, as they could also be used to block a good fork. The two disagree on whether the hypothetical case that Timón proposes is plausible or not. Additionally, Timón accuses Towns of not understanding the premise of his example, while Towns accuses Timón of arguing a hypothetical he does not want to consider. Ultimately, the conversation ends without resolution.</p>
