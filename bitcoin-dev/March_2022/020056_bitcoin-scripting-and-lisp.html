    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin expressed interest in exploring the concept of using Chia Lisp for Lightning Network. He asked AJ about his experience with Chia Lisp and what he has built with it. In response to this, AJ shared that he had experimented with compiling Simplicity to Boolean circuits and found that the result was within an order of magnitude of the hand-made SHA256 circuit for bulletproofs. However, a question was raised about whether both simplicity and Chia Lisp would be suitable for a ZK prover.</p>
