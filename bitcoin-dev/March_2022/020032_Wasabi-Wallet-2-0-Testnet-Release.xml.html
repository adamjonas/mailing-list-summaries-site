    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Wasabi Wallet has released its 2.0 version for review and feedback. The wallet provides effortless privacy to users through deep Tor integration on the network layer and BIP158 block filters or the Bitcoin full node on the synchronization layer. The blockchain layer has been upgraded with a new Wabisabi coinjoin implementation, which is a drop-in replacement for the ZeroLink coinjoin coordination protocol.Wabisabi uses keyed verified anonymous credentials and Pedersen commitments instead of Chaumian blind signatures, allowing for anonymous DoS protection without relying on equal amount outputs. This enables a more sophisticated amount decomposition using standard denominations of low Hamming weight, resulting in "changeless" coinjoins for transactions with more than 50 inputs. The minimum amount for participation is now 5000 sats, saving block space and reducing mining fees.The UX has also been improved, making coinjoin transactions the default as soon as bitcoin is received in the wallet. Within a few hours, the user will have numerous utxos that can be spent privately without revealing their pre-mix transaction history. The wallet automatically selects private coins with sufficient sats when spending to an address. If the private balance is insufficient, the user can adjust the coin selection with the help of contact labels. Wasabi suggests adjusting the payment amount to avoid creating a change utxo, decreasing fees and improving future privacy.The release is currently available for testing on testnet, and users are encouraged to review the cryptography and coordination protocol and analyze the resulting transaction graph in the wild. Download the testnet release from Github and visit the Wasabi Wallet website or Onion link for more information.</p>
