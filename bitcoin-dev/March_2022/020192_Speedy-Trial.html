    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context is about the misunderstanding of Bitcoin soft fork activation mechanism among some users, miners, and exchanges who consider signaling as voting. The sender of the email believes that this problem exists and needs to be addressed by improving the activation method with BIP 8/LOT=TRUE, which has advantages over speedy trial. However, the recipient argues that changing how Bitcoin is engineered is not a solution, and persistent explaining should be used instead. The sender provides examples of mining pools, users, and exchanges to support their point, but the recipient questions the significance of these examples. The downsides of the current activation method are also discussed, including the waste of time during the signaling period, the perception of voting, and the advantage given to miners over economic nodes. The sender acknowledges that they are not trying to convince the recipient, and both parties can have different opinions. Finally, the sender expresses their intention to continue discussing this problem and its solutions for future soft forks.</p>
