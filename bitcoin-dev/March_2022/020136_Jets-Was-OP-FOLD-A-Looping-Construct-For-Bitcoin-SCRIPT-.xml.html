    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Billy and ZmnSCPxj discuss the implementation of a cleanstack rule and the necessary critical mass for the network to benefit from a proposed jet feature. The cleanstack rule would prevent a script from validating if more than just a true value is left on the stack, and there was also an even stronger cleanstack rule where the stack and alt stack are totally empty. To implement a new jet, there would need to be a soft fork to make known jet scripts lighter weight than their non-jet counterparts. The minimum critical mass needed for a jet to break even would be when two nodes that support it are connected, and this depends on the size of the script. The constants table for a jet would be part of the SCRIPT puzzle and not in the witness solution, with the SCRIPT divided into two parts: a table of constants and the actual opcodes to execute.</p>
