    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Peter and Prayank about BIP47, Prayank shares a link to a newer version (v3 and v4) of it proposed on GitHub. This version eliminates the toxic change issue, which sounds like an improvement. Prayank explains how using an xpub does not provide anonymity as oneâ€™s payments can be identified if the xpub is shared with anyone, including the platform or anyone who hacks it. However, using a payment code enables public association without revealing the payment identifier in the blockchain, which makes it difficult for anyone other than the sender to know if funds have been received. Prayank also suggests a rust library to use BIP47, which can be helpful for application developers to implement it in different bitcoin projects.</p>
