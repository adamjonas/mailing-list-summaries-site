    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev discussion centered around various topics related to improving the efficiency of Bitcoin transactions. A suggestion was made by ZmnSCPxj to discuss cross-input compression of puzzles/solutions, which could save bytes and require less heavy crypto math. This would be similar to the Chia network, which allows any coin spend to reference any output created in the same block, aggregating all signatures in a block. However, implementing this in Bitcoin may not be feasible.The conversation then moved towards the block packing problem, where miners could fit more transactions in their block using a block template optimizer. However, it makes the problem harder since the transaction's cost is cheaper if it is similar to other transactions in the block. This discussion explored different cost options for different types of transactions in Chia.The discussion also touched on BLS signatures and PTLC signatures. BLS signatures are cryptographic signatures that provide efficient verification and aggregation, while PTLC (Pay to contract) signatures are used to enable payments between parties through smart contracts. The conversation explored the potential benefits and drawbacks of these signature types.Finally, the conversation briefly mentioned Domain-specific languages (DSLs), suggesting that lisp/opcode language is the DSL. The group discussed whether including code comments in the blockchain is desirable, with some expressing concerns about the potential impact on the blockchain's size.</p>
