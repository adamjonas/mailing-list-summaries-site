    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor challenged Luke Dashjr's claims that BIP8 had broad consensus. Luke responded that it did have broad consensus before some developers decided to ignore the community and do their own thing. The discussion also touched on the "no-miner-veto" concerns with the Speedy Trial proposal, which Luke argued was still a miner veto and required a full deployment with UASF fallback to work. Russell suggested designing a new deployment mechanism that addressed the concerns of different factions. There was also mention of a previous proposal for eventual forced signalling, championed by Luke, which did not get broad consensus due to concerns about potentially knocking a significant fraction of mining power offline.</p>
