        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mercury Statechain wallet/service is considering two new features and seeking feedback. The first feature involves charging fees up-front via a Lightning Network (LN) invoice before generating a shared key deposit address, instead of collecting the fee in the withdrawal transaction as a UTXO paid to a fixed bitcoin address. This would address issues related to small withdrawal transaction fee outputs and privacy concerns over labeling all withdrawn coins as mercury statechain withdrawals. Users would copy the LN invoice into a third party LN wallet and pay the fee, which would be verified by an LN node running on the mercury server back end.The second feature involves enabling withdrawal directly into an LN channel, including creating and co-signing partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) with the mercury server. This eliminates the need for an on-chain transaction, which could be valuable in a high-fee environment. However, there are currently no LN wallets that support this type of direct payment to a dual funded channel opening transaction from a third party wallet. PSBTs can be sent to the channel counterparty out of band or via a third party LN wallet/node. They can be imported, signed, and exported and/or broadcasted fully signed PSBTs. Overall, both features have potential benefits such as mitigating issues related to small withdrawal transaction fee outputs and eliminating the need for on-chain transactions. However, the second feature requires support from LN wallets and nodes, which may limit its immediate implementation. Mercury Statechain is seeking feedback on these features to improve their services.</p>
