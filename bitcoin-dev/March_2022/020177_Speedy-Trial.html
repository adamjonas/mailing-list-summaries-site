    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Jorge Timón and AJ Towns debated the hypothetical scenario of an "evil fork" in Bitcoin. Timón argued that even if a fork is evil, it may not be recognized as such by everyone, and therefore, there should be a mechanism to block it. However, Towns countered that any solution that allows blocking an evil fork, even when others don't agree that it's evil, would also allow an enemy of Bitcoin to block a good fork. He suggested that the best approach would be to create a new coin with a better system, as Satoshi did, and let everyone else join in as problems with the old one become unavoidably obvious. Towns also pointed out that rejecting bad premises is more important than arguing hypotheticals with no relationship to reality.</p>
