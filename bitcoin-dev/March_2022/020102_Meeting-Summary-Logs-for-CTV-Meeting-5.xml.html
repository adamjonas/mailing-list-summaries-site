    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the communication thread, a discussion around Speedy Trial (ST) took place and it was explained as a short softfork attempt with `lockinontimeout=false` being done first, followed by offering a UASF `lockinontimeout=true` version if the former fails. The conversation also touched on the criticism of ST and its impact on miners and users who decide the rules, giving users less opportunities to react and oppose a malevolent change in case miners impose such a change on them. The conversation then shifted towards the trust factor of developers, with one participant expressing their distrust towards Jeremy Rubin, but acknowledging that this is subjective and off-topic. The conversation concluded by explaining how users can resist activation mechanisms like ST through hashpower and UASFs, ensuring they have a say in the upgrades made.</p>
