    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the concept of 'jets' and their implementation in Bitcoin. A jet is a script that enables the compression of various operations into one opcode to reduce transaction fees. The conversation delves into how jets can be introduced into the network without a soft fork and whether it's worth implementing them as they may disincentivize users. They also discuss how new jets can be added to the network and what critical mass would be required for their efficient use. There is talk about introducing higher-order functions ability to jets through OP_LOOP and its possibilities. Finally, there is a suggestion to redesign the language so that `OP_PUSH` is not in the opcode stream, but instead, we have a separate table of constants that is attached / concatenated to the actual SCRIPT to make jets more useful.</p>
