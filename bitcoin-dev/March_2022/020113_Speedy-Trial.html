    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion, developers discussed the issue of activation and the potential for users to oppose proposals as a mechanism for avoiding activation. The discussion also touched on quantum computing concerns and the security of taproot addresses. One proposed solution was to allow users to actively oppose a proposal by invalidating the block that produces activation. However, this would require coordination among users and could lead to a fork. Alternatively, users can choose not to use taproot, not enforce it, or run an older version of Bitcoin Core. Quantum concerns were discussed, with arguments made for not using taproot addresses if worried about their security and the possibility of recovery even if taproot were suddenly banned. The discussion also touched on a previous proposal to mandate eventual forced signaling, which did not get broad consensus due to concerns over knocking mining power offline.</p>
