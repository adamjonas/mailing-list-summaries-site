        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The recently released Wasabi Wallet 2.0 offers enhanced privacy features for users. While the wallet does not have coin control, it utilizes coinjoined coins that are indistinguishable to ensure transaction privacy. In cases where coinjoined coins cannot be used, the wallet employs an improved version of coin control that selects clusters of coins assumed to belong to the same wallet. The owner has control over who can see the ownership of equalized coinjoin UTXOs.The wallet operates based on the user's assumption of its threat model and does not mislead the user. However, using a change address in transactions can impact privacy. To make it difficult to analyze possible recipients, the wallet suggests using a change address that is the same as other outputs. It should be noted that Wasabi Wallet does not offer different types of addresses specifically for change. Nonetheless, recent improvements made by Bitcoin Core may enhance privacy in this regard.Some issues related to privacy, security, and other aspects remain unresolved and are discussed on GitHub or in various discussions. While the bitcoin-dev mailing list may not be the primary platform for target users of Wasabi 2.0, developers could benefit from being aware of its innovations.The new version of Wasabi Wallet introduces deep Tor integration and BIP158 block filters or the packaged Bitcoin full node to provide effortless privacy. The blockchain layer incorporates the Wabisabi coinjoin implementation, which replaces the ZeroLink coinjoin coordination protocol. This implementation enables anonymous DoS protection for centrally coordinated coinjoins without relying on equal amount outputs.The coordination allows for a more sophisticated amount decomposition, resulting in "changeless" coinjoins that reduce mining fees and the time until the user's utxo set is private. The user experience is designed to be simple: receive, wait, spend privately. When spending Bitcoin to an address, the wallet automatically selects private coins with sufficient sats and displays coin control to the user. Adjusting the payment amount slightly is recommended to avoid creating a change utxo, thereby decreasing fees and enhancing future privacy.In Wasabi Wallet, labeling is mandatory, abstracting away the concept of utxos and displaying only contact labels for users to choose from. The 2.0 version can be downloaded from GitHub, and users are encouraged to test the new UI/UX, review the cryptography and coordination protocol, and analyze resulting transaction graphs in the wild. A testnet coordinator is provided with the release.Overall, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 aims to provide users with improved privacy features through its integration of Tor, implementation of the Wabisabi coinjoin protocol, and simplified user experience. Users are invited to test and provide feedback on the new version to further enhance its functionality.</p>
