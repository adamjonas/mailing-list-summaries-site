    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Jeremy has suggested removing the dust limit from Bitcoin, citing five reasons. He believes that it is not necessary for developers to dictate what outputs people create and that dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart contracts. Additionally, he notes that dust-sized HTLCs in Lightning force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode, which has implications for regulatory classification of channels in various jurisdictions. He argues that treating fund transfers agnostically would simplify this process. Furthermore, thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as value markers for transactions. Finally, Jeremy suggests that if confidential transactions are ever implemented, preventing dust creation without compromising privacy/allowed transfers would be difficult. Jeremy acknowledges that there are concerns about dust being spam and dust fingerprinting attacks. However, he believes that both issues are preventable. For example, well-behaved wallets could avoid redeeming outputs that cost more in fees than they are worth. Instead of changing the source code, node operators can adjust their settings to allow free transactions, including dust transactions, if there is enough room for them. Therefore, all that is needed is to convince nodes to change their settings.</p>
