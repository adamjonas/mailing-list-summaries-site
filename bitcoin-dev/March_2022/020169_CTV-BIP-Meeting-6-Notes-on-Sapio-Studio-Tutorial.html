    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The 6th CTV meeting was focused on a tutorial for Sapio Studio, a Bitcoin wallet/IDE that allows users to play with Bitcoin Smart Contracts. The software is still in its alpha stage, but it has been improving over time. The tutorial covered the process of setting up Sapio Studio and creating a Bitcoin Vault instance similar to one recently shared by James O'Beirne. However, there were some issues faced by participants, including build system problems, valid argument passing, minrelay fees, and minor GUI bugs. Despite these challenges, the software was successfully used, as demonstrated in the tutorial's screenshots. It was capable of restarting and resuming sessions, recompiling with effect updates, and enforcing recursive covenants that can be made compatible with any covenant upgrades. The participants identified areas of improvement needed to make the GUI more intuitive, which will be incorporated in the coming weeks.</p>
