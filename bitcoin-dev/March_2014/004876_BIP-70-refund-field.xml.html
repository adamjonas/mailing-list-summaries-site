    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn discussed the idea of using tags in a contact list to represent different payment types and suggested that the address could be used as the tag for payments delivered by the blockchain. He proposed the creation of a channel that would allow both parties to exchange master keys and create valid addresses for each other, with the initial handshake agreeing on tags of individual address indexes if used. Payments could go back and forth, with either party able to delete the channel information and stop observing keys as soon as they no longer expect a payment from the other. In response to a question about VAT, Hearn clarified that it was just an example label and had no weight in his prior arguments.</p>
