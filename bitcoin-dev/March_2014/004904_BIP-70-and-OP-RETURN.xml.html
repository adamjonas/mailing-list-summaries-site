    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>From the given context, it appears that the process of encoding the OP_RETURN script into an Output structure is being discussed. However, there seems to be confusion regarding the question being asked as the answer is already provided in the first paragraph. It is not clear what the question is exactly. The use of technical terms like OP_RETURN and Output structure suggests that the discussion may be related to blockchain technology or cryptocurrency.It is important to note that OP_RETURN is a specific type of transaction output used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its main purpose is to embed arbitrary data into the blockchain without causing any change in the ownership or transfer of coins. This allows for various applications such as storing metadata or proof of existence. On the other hand, an Output structure refers to the part of a transaction that specifies where the coins are being sent and how much is being sent. It contains the recipient's address and the amount of cryptocurrency being transferred. Overall, it can be inferred that the discussion revolves around the technical aspects of cryptocurrency transactions and the use of OP_RETURN script in encoding data onto the blockchain.</p>
