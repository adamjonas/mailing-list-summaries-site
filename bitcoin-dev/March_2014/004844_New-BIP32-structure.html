    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about bandwidth and server performance, Mike Hearn expresses concerns that Electrum and Mycelium cannot watch as many addresses as they want due to the traffic it will create on servers. While he acknowledges the constraint is not so important for bloom-filter clients, he suggests increasing the number of unused receiving addresses watched by Electrum clients from the default five to twenty. Hearn notes that when Electrum runs on an Android device with a 3G connection, it sometimes takes up to one minute to synchronize with a wallet that has hundreds of addresses, but he has yet to confirm if this is caused by addresses or block headers. Hearn also suggests that merchant accounts should behave differently from regular user accounts since merchants need to generate an unlimited number of receiving addresses. However, some are skeptical of distinguishing between users and merchants, arguing that it is unsafe to assume merchants are more sophisticated than end-users. In terms of synchronization, Hearn hopes for fully automated synchronization between different instances of a wallet using only no other source of information than the blockchain. He clarifies that he was not referring to label sync, which is an Electrum plugin that relies on a centralized server, but only to the synchronization of the list of addresses in the wallet.</p>
