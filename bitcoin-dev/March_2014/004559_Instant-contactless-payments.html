    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated 03/06/2014, Alex Kotenko discussed the optional nature of supporting Bluetooth in wallets. He stated that if a wallet does not support Bluetooth, transactions can still be received via the P2P network. However, he recommended going for Bluetooth as it is part of the plan. Kotenko also expressed the need to ensure that all major wallets are supported while deciding and implementing a solution for Bluetooth on both wallet and POS sides. Kotenko mentioned that no other wallets support NFC by now, let alone Bluetooth. He suggested waiting for other main wallets to accept innovations before completely switching to Bluetooth. URI method and QR codes will still be kept for backwards compatibility. He emphasized that bluetooth support for his POS is not a problem, and it can be easily plugged in and made to work. However, the support among all hardware/software and polished user experience are the main things to focus on. Finally, in response to Kotenko's email, the recipient assured him to take all the time needed and pointed out that Bitcoin URI compatibility does not need to be broken in order to support direct payments via Bluetooth. It is simply an add-on in both BIP21 and BIP70 cases.</p>
