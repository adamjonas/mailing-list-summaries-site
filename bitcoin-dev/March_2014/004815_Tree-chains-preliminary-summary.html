    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from March 2014, Mark Friedenbach discussed the possibility of a scheme leading to inflation. He stated that there was no way this could happen as the worst case scenario would only be the theft of coins willingly put into the pegging pool. In response, the other party argued that it wouldn't be entirely unfair to describe an unbacked secondary coin as inflation and cited altcoins as an example. However, they agreed to look more closely at Friedenbach's proposal. The conversation also touched on the idea of two-way pegging and private accounting servers potentially eliminating the need for it. They concluded that improving scale and decentralization were both important goals and complementary to each other.</p>
