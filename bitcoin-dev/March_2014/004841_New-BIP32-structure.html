    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Mike Hearn has noticed that greenaddress.it is creating seeds with 24 words instead of the usual 12. He wants to know whether bitcoinj is compatible with it before switching to the one discussed on a forum. To this, they replied on Reddit that they use 256-bit BIP39 seeds for their 512-bit extended HD wallet key pairs as advised by BIP32. They want to follow the BIP32 specification because they are working with hardware wallets that have been designed with BIP32 in mind and wanted to avoid any incompatibility issues.The Bitcore team member expressed interest in the schema originally proposed by Mike, which seems flexible enough for their needs. They wonder if there can be an agreement on a format to exchange the tips of each branch on the tree when the user exports or backs up the wallet. Andreas Schildbach emphasizes that either they should be 100% interoperable or 0%. There should not be anything in between as users will delete seeds without knowing there is still money in them on another implementation. Matias Alejo Garcia suggests adding a /(hash of the wallet name)/ on the BIP32 path to avoid confusion.</p>
