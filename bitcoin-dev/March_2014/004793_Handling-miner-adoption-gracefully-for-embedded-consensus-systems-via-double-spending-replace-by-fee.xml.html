    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context revolves around a discussion on Bitcoin and its development. The person who initiated the conversation wants to limit the Bitcoin-development discussion to issues that are relevant to the owners of the hashrate and companies that pay developer salaries. Moreover, the person wants others to be honest about Bitcoin being a centralized system and wants people to stop arguing technical points on the altar of distributed/decentralized systems. They believe that if someone wants decentralization, they should go with altchains. The discussion also involves selling corn for bitcoin, and the person believes it will be more profitable to do so through a bitcoin-blockchain-based system in which they have the capability to audit the code that executes the trade. However, Mark Friedenbach argues that this isn't distributed-systems-development but Bitcoin-development. According to him, discussion over chain parameters is fine among those interested in such topics, but not here. On the other hand, Troy Benjegerdes finds it irresponsible for Bitcoiners to extol the virtues of distributed systems and then claim any discussion about alternate chains as 'off-topic'. He argues that if Bitcoin-core is for distributed systems, then all the different altcoins with different hash algorithms should be viable topics for discussion.</p>
