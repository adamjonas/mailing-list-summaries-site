    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Adam Back proposed the term "fraud proof" for a SPV proof with a longer chain, but Jorge Tim贸n suggested that "reorg proof" would be more appropriate since reorganizations can happen without any fraud. Tim贸n also proposed the possibility of pegging a side-chain to a private chain, which could allow for higher scaling while retaining bitcoin security properties. However, he noted that requiring a side chain proof of burn to move back to the side chain could lock funds by the dishonest private chain operator, and instead suggested allowing unilateral withdrawals to impose on the private chain the task of observing the side chain looking for double-spends. Tim贸n referred to freimarkets terminology in his discussion.</p>
