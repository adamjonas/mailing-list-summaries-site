    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In March 2014, users were requesting the use of mBTC instead of ÂµBTC as a standard. Some wallets, such as MultiBit HD, offered customizable options for icons and symbols to accommodate various preferences. The NIST guidelines for representation of SI unit symbols were applied, with no conversion to native language and no RTL giving an icon+m. A Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, Jeff Garzik, suggested moving straight to uBTC, but the consensus was to use mBTC. Some were concerned that moving to uBTC later may result in additional user confusion due to another decimal place transition. Nonetheless, the adoption of mBTC was already decided, and it was too late to sway this on a mailing list thread.</p>
