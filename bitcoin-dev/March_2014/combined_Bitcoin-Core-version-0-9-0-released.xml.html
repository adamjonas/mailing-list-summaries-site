        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 has been released as a major update that brings new features and bug fixes. The release includes frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems during the initial sync, so the new version includes Windows 64-bit installer. The minimum requirements for this release have been updated and now require a 64-bit-capable CPU and Mac OS 10.6 or later. This release contains several fixes for transaction ID (TXID) malleability issues. Additionally, it drops the default fee required to relay transactions across the network and for miners to consider the transaction in their blocks to 0.01mBTC per kilobyte. The latest release of the Bitcoin client includes several improvements and features like an open URI dialog, coin control features, and an improved receive coins workflow are among the updates. The 'Receive' tab has been turned into a form for requesting payments, while historical address list functionality has been moved to the File menu. The client has also been rebranded as 'Bitcoin Core'. To reduce confusion between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software, the reference client has been renamed to Bitcoin Core. A separate bitcoin-cli client has been added as well. Initialization and shutdown have been moved to a thread, eliminating "Not responding" messages during startup. Other changes in the 0.9 release include moving away from the bitcoind executable functioning both as a server and as a RPC client, with the RPC client functionality being split into a separate executable, 'bitcoin-cli'. The behavior of the `walletpassphrase` RPC when the wallet is already unlocked has also changed between 0.8 and 0.9. This release also contains new notion of 'conflicted' transactions, reported as confirmations: -1, updated help and tests for 'getreceivedby(account|address)', and adding new 'addrlocal' field to 'getpeerinfo' output. The update also includes several miscellaneous additions, including a Linux script to limit outgoing bandwidth and a '-regtest' mode which is similar to testnet but private. The credits for this release include contributions from numerous individuals, including Gavin Andresen, Peter Todd, Jeff Garzik, and many others.</p>
