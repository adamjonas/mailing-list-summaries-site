    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion here is about multisignature creation and management. The author is using <a href="https://coinb.in/multisig/">https://coinb.in/multisig/</a> for this purpose, despite some initial issues that were resolved later. The thread started with a comment by Drak who liked the idea of assuming each party uses HD wallets to simplify things. However, Jeff Garzik pointed out that this assumes a different reality from our current one. Gavin Andrese concluded that multisig wallets are a different reality from our current one and should be done correctly from the beginning. The question of which wallets support multisig/P2SH at this point was also raised but remained unanswered.</p>
