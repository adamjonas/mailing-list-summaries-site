    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Roy Badami, the topic of base58-encoded private keys was discussed. Badami suggested that people were currently using ssss-split to take these keys and reassemble them on any Linux machine without special software. He also mentioned that B Poettering's Linux command line SSSS implementation seemed to be included in most Linux distributions. In response, Whitlock respectfully pointed out that it was also possible to take a base58-encoded private key and run it through GPG, which is included in most Linux distros. However, he noted that although there are benefits to standardizing this process, not many wallets can import BIP38 keys. He expressed uncertainty about what software could understand such keys or how to generate one. Overall, Whitlock's comment was simply an observation and did not intend to argue against standardizing these processes.</p>
