    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alex Kotenko expressed his intention to implement BIP70 as soon as possible. He cited lack of support among wallets as the biggest obstacle, with only Andreas' Wallet currently supporting it. However, Andreas Schildbach clarified that Bitcoin Wallet has supported the customer side of the protocol since 2011 and has an install base of half a million devices. The merchant side used to have the Labs enabling but this has been removed in recent weeks. The discussion also included a link to a free O'Reilly book on Graph Databases.</p>
