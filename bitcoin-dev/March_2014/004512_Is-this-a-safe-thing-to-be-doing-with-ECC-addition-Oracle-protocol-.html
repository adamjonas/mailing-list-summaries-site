    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The founder of Social Minds, Edmund Edgar has introduced a new m-of-n contract implementation. This is based on the Reality Keys service, which acts as an External State Oracle, and allows registration of possible outcomes with public keys for "yes" and "no". The winner gets their private key from Reality Keys to release the funds. Peter Todd suggested an effective way to use these keys for m-of-n contracts without non-standard transactions or refund transactions. Edmund Edgar combined the public key of each party with the public key of the outcome they're representing into one address spendable by either Alice or Bob after the outcome occurs. However, he is concerned that Bob could intentionally weaken the resulting public key before producing it so that he could sign a transaction with it without needing to know the private key. The example script is available on GitHub and people can comment on whether it's a safe thing to do.</p>
