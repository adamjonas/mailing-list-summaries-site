    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A request was made on 03/21/2014 at 10:11 AM by Chris D'Costa to be granted access to post to the dev list. The purpose of the request was related to the Meek hardware wallet project, which is working on a solution to avoid MITM attacks when communicating pay-to information over a non-secure transport mechanism.In addition to this request, a link to download a free O'Reilly book called "Graph Databases" was provided in the email signature. The book serves as a guide to graph databases and their applications, and was written by three acclaimed leaders in the field.</p>
