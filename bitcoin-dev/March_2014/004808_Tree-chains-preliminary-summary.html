    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread dated March 25, 2014, is a discussion among Bitcoin developers and community members about the need for a friendly and professional environment on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Alan Reiner initiates the conversation by expressing his concern over Peter Todd's corrosive communication style, which breeds hostility and makes it a scary place to discuss things. Jeff Garzik agrees with Alan and suggests introducing an openly stated moderation policy to prevent potential contributors from being turned away by abrasive or hostile attitudes towards others. Mike Hearn shares his anecdote of hostility and notes that some developers are turned off by Peter Todd's apocalyptic vision and negative view on bitcoin. However, he also notes that people can simultaneously make useful contributions and turn potential contributors away in open source projects. Slush adds that some people were making fun of Peter's reactions on bitcoin-dev. He fully agrees that the mailing list should maintain a friendly environment. The discussion ends with a link to a free O'Reilly book called "Graph Databases," which is the definitive new guide to graph databases and their applications. The email thread is signed with PGP signatures from various individuals who participated in the discussion.</p>
