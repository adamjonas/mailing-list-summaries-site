    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated March 11, 2014, Gavin Andresen suggested that if a remote party is involved in a multisig and speaks the "let's set up a multisig wallet together / let's spend from a multisig" protocols, then it should be reasonable to assume they are HD-capable. However, Jeff Garzik disagreed, stating that this was an unnecessary restriction and that people were already writing and deploying multisig wallets that didn't match this assumption. He added that although HD is cool, there is still a lack of infrastructure, with popular libraries and the reference client lacking support. Building a protocol that assumes HD is optimistic at this stage. Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and Open Source Evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</p>
