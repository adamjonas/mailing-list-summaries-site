    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The FLUSH+RELOAD paper mentions virtualization and claims that the clflush instruction works not only towards processes on the same OS but also against processes in a separate guest OS if executed on the host OS. Both the authors and Vulnerability Note VU#976534 claim disabling hypervisor memory page de-duplication prevents the attack. TRESOR is only applicable if running in a non-virtualized OS, and it only implements AES. However, it seems it could work for ECDSA as well, as they use the four x86 debug registers to fit a 256 bit privkey for the entire machine uptime. They actually do what Mike Hearn mentioned and disable preemption in Linux to ensure atomicity. One could imagine different levels of TRESOR-like ECDSA with different tradeoffs of complexity vs security. To handle multiple keys and get full TRESOR benefits, one could perhaps store a BIP 0032 starting string / seed + counter in the debug registers and have the atomic kernel code generate new keys and do the signing.</p>
