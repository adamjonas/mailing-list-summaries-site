    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation with Mike Hearn, an individual was asked to provide an elevator pitch of their device. They responded by highlighting the unique features of their device such as its ability to survive intense use and drops on the floor, being cheaper than a regular phone/tablet, having simpler operation and being safer due to the inability to install random apps and its lack of temptation for theft. The individual emphasized that even cheap cashier employees hired by small corner shops would be able to operate the device easily.</p>
