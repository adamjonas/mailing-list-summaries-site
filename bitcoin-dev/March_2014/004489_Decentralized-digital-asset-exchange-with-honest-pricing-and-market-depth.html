    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is asking for help developing the code to trade between two block chains so they can trade "cats and dogs and bits." They express frustration that the conversation has turned to existential concerns about globally knowable and accurate price history, insisting that it doesn't matter. The author argues that they just need a clear design document to trade between two chains and they will write the code. On the mailing list, Jeff Garzik responds that this is not a philosophical issue but rather a development one. Mark Friedenbach chimes in with an argument that the seller does care about accurate historic market data. Troy Benjegerdes agrees with Garzik's point of view and tells everyone to stop worrying about the historic data problem and just get him working code for cross-chain trades.</p>
