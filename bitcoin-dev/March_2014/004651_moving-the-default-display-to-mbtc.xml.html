    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from March 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed disappointment that the Bitcoin Wallet had moved to mBTC instead of uBTC. He believed that the consensus was for uBTC and that moving to it later would cause confusion with yet another decimal place transition. However, Wladimir responded saying that he had given up on trying to get a consensus about this topic. Although everyone agreed that a decimal shift would be good, the discussion always ended in nothing happening. Wladimir couldn't blame Andreas for making the change to mBTC since people in the community were already familiar with it. Additionally, mBTC seemed to be catching on on Reddit and some exchanges and price sites used it when Bitcoin was over $1000. Moving to muBTC would require more coordinated education effort, but it would be better because it is the final unit change ever needed without a hard fork.</p>
