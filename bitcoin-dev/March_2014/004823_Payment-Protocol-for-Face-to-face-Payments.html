    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation suggests that the current solution is not suitable for certain cases, which would require creating a new infrastructure. The speaker acknowledges that this would be a significant undertaking and would involve developing their own infrastructure. No further information is provided about what this infrastructure might entail or what specific cases are being referred to.It is worth noting that the context is limited to just a few sentences of dialogue, so it is difficult to draw any conclusions beyond what is explicitly stated. Additionally, there is an HTML attachment mentioned in the text, but no information is given about what it contains or how it relates to the conversation.</p>
