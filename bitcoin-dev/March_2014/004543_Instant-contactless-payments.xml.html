    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author shares a video demonstrating NFC technology with XBTerminal. The current implementation uses an NDEF URI message with Bitcoin URI inside, and transactions are propagated to the network by the phone using its own Internet connection, but this is not ideal as it's only supported by Andreas' Wallet. Supporting Bluetooth is optional but recommended. The transaction takes just a few seconds, most of which is manual payment confirmation. The author wonders about the receipt step, suggesting that generating a PDF on the device and sending it via NFC could be supported by the BIP70 payment protocol to avoid the second tap. The author also mentions that Oyster readers in London now accept contactless cards directly along with Oyster cards themselves, leading to the thought that Bitcoin support could eventually be added to the system without hardware replacements.</p>
