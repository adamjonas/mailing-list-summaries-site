    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Andreas Schildbach and Jeff Garzik on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2014, they discussed the issue of relying on mobile connectivity for making payments. They both agreed that it was not a reliable method as internet connectivity can be problematic in certain situations such as overcrowded areas with overloaded radio environments or old buildings with thick walls. Even in the middle of London, cellphone network connectivity can be an issue. However, Jeff Garzik suggested that near-field web servers could work fine for BIP73, but Andreas pointed out that this was not a feasible solution in Germany. The conversation ended with a link to a free O'Reilly book on graph databases.</p>
