    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated March 29, 2014, Gregory Maxwell discussed the potential use of secret sharing in constructing threshold signatures. He suggested that it should be carefully constructed so that the same polynomials and interpolation code can be used for both secret sharing and threshold signatures. In response to this suggestion, a paper by Steven Goldfeder, Joseph Bonneau, Rosario Gennaro, and Arvind Narayanan was referenced. The paper did not mention anything special about the polynomial to use other than using a "random polynomial f of degree t - 1 such that d = f(0)." It was questioned whether there was more to this, but it was ultimately deemed compatible with Matt's proposal.</p>
