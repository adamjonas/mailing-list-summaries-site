    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 28, 2014, Mike Hearn sent an email stating that he did not see a reason to be enthusiastic about BitPay or BopShop supporting BIP70 because it does not do more than what they were already doing. However, he did say that he would support it once the spec goes further than what was previously possible. In response to a question about whether he would support Trezor using BIP70 to present signed payment identities on the screen with a firmware update, he said that it would be neat and he would not want to spoil the show. He did express a wish that established identity could be reused to send and receive funds.</p>
