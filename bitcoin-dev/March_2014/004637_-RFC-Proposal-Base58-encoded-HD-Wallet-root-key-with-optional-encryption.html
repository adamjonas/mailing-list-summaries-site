    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Pavol Rusnak and Jean-Paul Kogelman, the topic of a proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) was discussed. Kogelman expressed concern that in the proposed BIP, if a user enters a password with a typo, they will not be notified of the error but instead presented with a wallet balance of 0 after the blockchain has been scanned. Rusnak explained that the proposed BIP uses a bloom filter, which optimizes for two elements and catches 99.9975% of typos while still providing plausible deniability. The conversation then shifted to the issue of compatibility and whether optional outsourcing of the KDF (key derivation function) would break it. Rusnak argued that this would lead to code generated in one client being unusable in another client, violating the spec. The analogy was made that replacing SHA256 with SHA3 in a Bitcoin client implementation would also cause issues.</p>
