    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A non-developer writer has expressed interest in contributing to the Bitcoin community with writing, editing, and marketing skills. They have asked for information on the procedure to do so and if there is someone in charge of that area. The writer has given two examples of unclear areas within the community. One example was when Gavin asked for proofreading of 0.9.0rc2; it was unclear how to send the changes. The second example was about the page at <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitcoinPayment,">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitcoinPayment,</a> which stated that "the wiki receiving wallet (for the wiki itself) is also MtGox," but this is likely outdated information. The writer provides their contact information and welcomes off-list replies. Meanwhile, the email was sent via the Bitcoin-development mailing list, which can be joined through a subscription link provided in the email. Additionally, a link to a Reddit post about developers, core developers, and contributors was included in the email for readers to check out. Lastly, a promotional message for NetFlow Analyzer software was added at the end of the email.</p>
