    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris D'Costa proposed a decentralized ledger of "device keys" to establish secure communications and verify signatures without the need for a third-party CA or prior dialogue. These keys are separate from Bitcoin keys and are not related to any human identity. The device keys are not meant to be a permanent identity or store encrypted data. A new owner would need to establish a new device key, which is more specific to the project. Chris also believed that proof of work is detrimental to security, and he has used time in reverse sense - advanced knowledge of all pubkeys. He referred to the "distributed ledger of device keys" as the "Web-of-trust re-imagined." However, he hesitated to discuss it further due to its connection with Bitcoin keys. Some users on bitcointalk suggested having their vanity addresses available for others to find and verify ownership, but centralized storage in forums is not secure. They signed their own addresses and quoted them in the forums. Chris suggested establishing a shadow P2P network instead of linking device keys to a person's identity or Bitcoin identity.</p>
