    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Brent Shambaugh, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has been working on some use cases for the W3C payments workshop and wants to include Bitcoin. He has provided a link to an editable page with key use cases for Web Payments Mobile Use Cases, which are open to members of the webpayments community group. Brent is also attempting to apply a template that includes key use cases, regions, and currencies for the solution. The considerations for use cases include adding real money to the service, buying physical goods in the real world, paying for physical services, converting virtual money back into paper money, transferring money from one person to another, buying products online, resolving disputes, viewing transactions, and securing the wallet. Brent encourages others to contribute to the project and thanks them for their time.</p>
