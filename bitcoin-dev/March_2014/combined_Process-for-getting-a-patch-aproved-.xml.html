        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this conversation, Kevin sought guidance on submitting a patch. Wladimir recommended using GitHub instead of sending patches through the mailing list, as reviewing can take some time and patches sent to mailing lists may get lost. The GitHub model is better as an issue appears until it is either merged or closed, ensuring it doesn't get overlooked. However, if the proposed change concerns a protocol change, it is advisable to discuss it on the mailing list as people building other implementations read there and not on GitHub.There are a few options available for submitting a patch. Firstly, one could send it through the list as an attachment. However, this may not always be the most efficient method. Another option is to use a version control system such as Git or SVN to create and submit your patch. These systems allow for more collaborative development and easier tracking of changes. Additionally, many open-source projects prefer patches submitted this way.It is essential to ensure that your patch adheres to any coding standards or guidelines set forth by the project. This will increase the likelihood of it being accepted and merged into the codebase. It is also crucial to test your patch thoroughly before submitting it. Overall, multiple ways exist to submit a patch, and it is essential to follow the appropriate procedures and guidelines set forth by the project.</p>
