        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Tom Geller, a writer and presenter from Oberlin, Ohio, has expressed his gratitude to all who assisted him in getting involved in the Bitcoin community. He was contacted by Mike Hearn with the idea of creating a "Bitcoin Developer Network" subsection on bitcoin.org to provide professionally curated web content for developers. Currently, the website is consumer-focused and the wiki section is facing technical difficulties. To address this gap, Tom proposes finding people to produce content while a web developer named Saivann assists with visual design.In an email exchange, Tom discusses the need for professional web content for developers interested in working with Bitcoin. The current bitcoin.org website is targeted towards consumers and the wiki section is not ideal for professional documentation. He suggests creating a "Bitcoin Developer Network" subsection on the website to provide curated content for developers. The hope is to find individuals willing to produce content and have Saivann, a web developer sponsored by the Foundation, assist with visual design. Tom also mentions his edits to the release notes for 0.9.0rc2 software and requests assistance if needed. However, his edits failed testing, and he hopes others will reach out to help resolve any issues. Additionally, Tom includes an advertisement for Perforce, a version control system, promoting its benefits over Subversion.Tom Geller, a writer and presenter from Oberlin, Ohio, has made his first contribution to the release notes of 0.9.0rc2 for the Bitcoin project. He posted a pull request on GitHub and welcomed any corrections that may be needed. However, his edits failed testing. Tom mentions that he assumes he'll receive emails as others add comments and requests anyone willing to help him privately contact him. Apart from his work with the Bitcoin project, Tom has experience in writing articles, marketing materials, creating videos, user guides, and books.The context includes discussions about the control of the Mt. Gox wiki and text editing on Github. Fixes for the Mt. Gox wiki are underway, but no specifics are given. Regarding text editing on Github, Wladimir provides a simple solution involving going to the release-notes page, clicking "edit", making desired changes, and adding a commit message. Tom expresses his thanks to those who provided advice and mentions that he will go over the 0.9.0rc2 text soon. The email concludes with contact information for Tom Geller, a writer/presenter specializing in articles, marketing, videos, user guides, and books.A non-developer writer expresses interest in contributing to the Bitcoin community with writing, editing, and marketing skills. They ask for information on how to do so and if there is someone in charge of that area. The writer provides two examples of unclear areas within the community, including difficulties in sending changes for proofreading and outdated information on a Bitcoin wiki page. They share their contact information and welcome off-list replies. The email also includes a subscription link to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list and a Reddit post about developers, core developers, and contributors. Additionally, a promotional message for NetFlow Analyzer software is included.In an email dated March 3, 2014, Tom Geller asks for suggestions on adding a file to a particular solution. Wladimir responds with a possible solution involving editing the file in the 0.9 branch on Github. The process includes going to the release notes page, clicking "edit", making changes, and adding a commit message.Tom Geller expresses concerns about sending payments to a wallet held by MtGox for editing the Bitcoin wiki. He believes it may prevent new contributors from joining and mentions not receiving a confirmation email after registering. However, the priority for moving the wiki to new hosting is low for MtGox. It is suggested to contact SomeoneWeird on IRC for manual approvals of new editing accounts.Peter Todd proofreads rc1 and submits his changes via pull-req on the Github repository. Drak suggests using Github's direct file editing feature, but it is not possible in this case as the file is not available at the repository. Peter raises concerns about sending payments to a Mt. Gox-held wallet for editing the Bitcoin wiki, which he believes is a hard blocker for new contributors. He mentions not receiving the confirmation email after registering for the wiki, suggesting that the process may be broken.On March 2, 2014, Peter Todd suggests using the pull request method to encourage proofreading with corrections applied. He submits his changes via pull-req on Github and mentions that no fancy software is required for diffing changes. However, Drak points out that editing files directly on the site is possible on Github, making contributing easy even for non-techy people.In an email thread, Tom Geller, a non-developer writer, expresses interest in contributing to the Bitcoin project through writing, editing, and marketing. He asks about the procedure for doing so and if there is someone in charge of that area.</p>
