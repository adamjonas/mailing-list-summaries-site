    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate on the standard for Bitcoin units was a hot topic in 2014. Andreas Schildbach shared his experience that Bitcoin Wallet's users did not complain about the mBTC switch and no one seemed to look at the Bitcoin price; instead, it was the amount in local currency that mattered to users. Meanwhile, Tamas Blummer lobbied for Bitcoin to have prices and fractions like currencies. He argued that numbers with more than two decimals were not perceived as prices but rather as geeky something that should be converted to local currency. He suggested that 3558 bits would be more accepted than 3.558 mBTC or 0.003578 BTC. Mike Hearn argued that the standard had become mBTC, which was already adopted. Jeff Garzik resurrected the conversation, expressing disappointment over Bitcoin Wallet's move to mBTC, and suggesting that consensus was uBTC. MultiBit HD developers offered a simple configuration panel that gave every possible combination, including icon, m+icon, μ+icon, BTC, mBTC, μBTC, XBT, mXBT, μXBT, sat, along with settings for leading/trailing symbol, commas, spaces, and points, which could be customized to meet specific needs beyond the offered default.</p>
