    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Jean-Paul Kogelman compared his proposal to BIP 39. He highlighted that there are some differences between the two proposals. Firstly, BIP 39 offers a list of words, instead of using a long string of case-sensitive letters and numbers. Secondly, he said that BIP 39 only offers one fixed length of entropy, always 12 words, with no option to increase or decrease the length. However, it was pointed out that BIP 39 actually supports 12/18/24 words which equates to 128/192/256 bits of entropy. Thirdly, Kogelman noted that BIP 39 doesn't have a genesis date field, unlike his proposal, so there would be no optimization during blockchain rescan. Fourthly, he mentioned that BIP 39 does not have password typo detection, although it has a detection feature. Fifthly, he stated that BIP 39 does not have a user-selectable KDF, only 2048 round PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. Finally, he noted that BIP 39 wallet implementers can use their own word lists, breaking cross-wallet compatibility, but they are encouraged to use the list provided.</p>
