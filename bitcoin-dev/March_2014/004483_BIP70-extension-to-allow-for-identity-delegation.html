    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It seems that the current user interface (UI) may not be expressive enough to alert users to potential issues with payment processing. This is due to a lack of authenticated fields beyond the memo field available to payment processors. However, for now, including the merchant name in the memo field and ensuring that hardware devices or second factor wallets display the memo should suffice. One proposed solution was to include a certificate viewer in the UI to allow advanced users to inspect the certificate and potentially find additional fields. However, this solution may only benefit advanced users and may not be feasible due to PKI CA's reluctance to sign certificates with arbitrary data. Ultimately, it is not desirable for users to have to go back to their CA with special requests.</p>
