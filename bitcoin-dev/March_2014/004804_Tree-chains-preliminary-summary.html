    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation seems to be discussing the concept of tree chains, which is designed to be a soft-fork upgrade to Bitcoin. The upgrade involves defining bitcoin as the top level chain and carrying transaction outputs from block to block to create outputs when funds are redeemed in the top block chain from children lower in the tree. This concept is similar to the chain-to-chain stuff via SPV proofs that Mark and Adam were talking about earlier. The order and reorganization guarantees have been identified as a significant advantage over their unsynched chain model. In the email, Mike Hearn expresses his concern about Peter Todd's behavior on the development list and how it puts people off from contributing. Hearn suggests that Todd's immediate knee-jerk reaction to anyone who disagrees with him is making the forum aggressive and ugly. Todd's insights, which are often deeply suspect, are more appropriate for bitcointalk, according to Hearn. Hearn also mentions that some developers refuse to post on the development list because they see how Peter Todd shoots people down in flames. Todd has been named explicitly as the source of the problem, and if Hearn were the moderator of this list, he would have banned Todd a long time ago because he values a friendly atmosphere more than Toddâ€™s insights. The email concludes with a request for Todd to take ground up redesigns of Bitcoin like what he proposes to bitcointalk.</p>
