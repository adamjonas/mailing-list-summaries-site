    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd in 2014, they discussed the vulnerability of Bitcoin addresses. While Todd suggested that following good practices and not reusing addresses could prevent this vulnerability, Maxwell believed that not everyone follows these practices and suggested using side-channel resistant signing as well. He mentioned Oleganza's recent blind signature scheme for ECDSA as a potential solution to this issue. Todd emphasized that even those without extensive cryptographic knowledge can take steps to defend themselves against attacks and create secure systems. However, he also criticized amateur efforts like Coinbase and EasyWallet who may not take these precautions.</p>
