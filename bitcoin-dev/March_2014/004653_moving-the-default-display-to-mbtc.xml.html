    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In March of 2014, there was discussion within the Bitcoin community about changing the unit denomination for Bitcoin. The consensus appeared to be moving towards using micro-Bitcoin (uBTC), with BitPay coordinating messaging and rollout efforts. However, Bitcoin Wallet had already moved to milli-Bitcoin (mBTC) weeks prior. This caused concern about user confusion with yet another decimal place transition in the future. There was a lack of consensus on how many decimal places should be used, with some suggesting uBTC and others advocating for mBTC. Some exchanges and price sites had already been using mBTC, which made it more familiar to users. Moving to uBTC would require a coordinated education effort. Despite the discussion, Wladimir noted that getting people to care was difficult. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, was involved in this discussion.</p>
