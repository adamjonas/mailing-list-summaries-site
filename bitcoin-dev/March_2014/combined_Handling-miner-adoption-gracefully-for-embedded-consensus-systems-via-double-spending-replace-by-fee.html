        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In March 2014, the bitcoin-dev mailing list had discussions on various topics related to Bitcoin development. One of the significant discussions was on proof-of-publication and the OP_RETURN length being reduced to 40 bytes before the 0.9 release. Peter Todd highlighted a security flaw in that OP_CHECKMULTISIG sigops weren't taken into account, potentially leading to unminable transactions and bloated mempools. He suggested ditching bare OP_CHECKMULTISIG outputs, which would require changes affecting Counterparty, the only entity currently using them.Troy Benjegerdes proposed adding an explicit 'data' field of about 169 bytes to each transaction, providing a small but usable data field for proof of publication. Peter Todd disclosed that he was working on tree chains, improving blockchains' scalability directly. Discussions were held on how to motivate people who own the hashrate and bulk of the coins to pay developers, and it was suggested that good marketing by Bitcoin developers could remind the people who profit from their efforts to make it profitable for developers to work on Bitcoin.The discussion also involved selling corn for Bitcoin through a blockchain-based system that allows auditing the code that executes the trade. Mark Friedenbach shared his proposals for such systems within the Bitcoin ecosystem, and Troy argued that decentralized altchains may be a better option. However, Mark disagreed, stating that Bitcoin is not centralized, and the discussion should stay focused on Bitcoin development without bringing up altchains.Furthermore, Todd suggested forking the Bitcoin Core software as a way to encourage miners to support it. He believed that miners who continued to run vanilla Bitcoin Core were neglecting their duty to the community. The discussion also touched upon UTXO commitments, additional non-validated data in the main chain vs merged mined chains, and the economics of attacking merge-mined chains. Todd advised Mastercoin, Counterparty, Colored Coins, etc., to design their systems keeping in mind the robustness of security offered by proof-of-publication on the Bitcoin blockchain. In conclusion, the email thread discussed several essential topics related to Bitcoin development, including proof-of-publication, OP_RETURN length, UTXO commitments, and the economics of attacking merge-mined chains. Peter Todd suggested ditching bare OP_CHECKMULTISIG outputs, proposed tree chains, and advised various applications to design their systems keeping in mind the robustness of security offered by proof-of-publication on the Bitcoin blockchain. The discussion also touched upon selling corn for Bitcoin through a blockchain-based system that allows auditing the code that executes the trade, forking the Bitcoin Core software, and motivating people who own the hashrate and bulk of the coins to pay developers.Meanwhile, in another conversation, Peter Todd expressed concern about miners accepting transactions with longer data than what is specified as standard by the reference implementation. He argued that non-validated proof of publication would be very expensive in the long run since they will have to compete with transactions that actually use the utxo, a feature that is a more valuable feature. However, he opposed any limitation on OP_RETURN at the protocol level other than the block size limit itself and wouldn't mind if they're removed from isStandard. Todd suggested different and configurable mining policies should be implemented to keep improving modularity. He believed that proof-of-publication is essential and miners would be smart to support it as it is more secure to be embedded within Bitcoin than alongside it. Additionally, Troy Benjegerdes proposed adding anti-DoS measures and preferential peering for nodes with a broader idea of what is an "allowed" transaction.Lastly, in an email conversation, Troy Benjegerdes expressed interest in selling corn for Bitcoin through a blockchain-based system that allows him to audit the code executing the trade. He shared his previous proposals for such a system within the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, he also stated that Bitcoin is a centralized system and suggested that those who want decentralization should go with altchains. In response, another person argued that Bitcoin is not a centralized system and bringing up altchains was a red herring. The conversation ended with a plea to keep the discussion on-topic to avoid becoming a moderated mailing list.</p>
