    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>If you are looking to submit a patch, there are a few options available. Firstly, you could send it through the list as an attachment, according to Kevin's query. However, this may not always be the most efficient method. Another option is to use a version control system, such as Git or SVN, to create and submit your patch. These systems allow for more collaborative development and easier tracking of changes. Additionally, many open source projects prefer patches submitted this way.It is important to ensure that your patch adheres to any coding standards or guidelines set forth by the project. This will increase the likelihood of it being accepted and merged into the codebase. Be sure to also test your patch thoroughly before submitting it.Overall, there are multiple ways to submit a patch and it is important to follow the appropriate procedures and guidelines set forth by the project.</p>
