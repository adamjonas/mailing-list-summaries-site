    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development list veered off-topic when Troy Benjegerdes questioned whether a Bitmessage-like network would be subject to front-running via a sybil attack. Jeff Garzik suggested that this was not the appropriate forum for such discussions, and Mark Friedenbach pointed out that the argument against Bitmessage applies equally well to Bitcoin transactions themselves. The conversation then moved on to the importance of accurate historic market data, with some arguing that buyers and sellers care most about it while others claimed not to give a "shit" about it as long as they get a good enough price. Overall, the focus was on the development of Bitcoin rather than its philosophy, with Jeff Garzik reminding everyone that he is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, working for BitPay, Inc.</p>
