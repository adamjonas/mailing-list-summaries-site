    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Troy Benjegerdes expresses his interest in selling corn for Bitcoin through a blockchain-based system, which would allow him to audit the code that executes the trade. Mark Friedenbach responds by sharing his proposals for such systems within the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, Troy argues that Bitcoin is still centralized due to the mining cartels that control most of the hashrate and suggests that decentralized altchains may be a better option. Mark rebuts this claim, stating that Bitcoin is not centralized and that the discussion should stay focused on Bitcoin development without bringing up altchains. They both agree that the mailing list should not become moderated. Finally, Troy mentions that there are interesting alt-hash-chains available with mass-produced hardware in high volume production.</p>
