    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The argument between using mBTC (millibitcoin) or uBTC (microbitcoin) is not only subjective, but also has practical implications. While some people may prefer the simplicity of dealing with whole numbers in mBTC, others like the idea of having more units with uBTC. However, when it comes to presenting prices, the use of decimals can cause confusion and errors. For example, reading 3.12345 mBTC versus 3123.45 uBTC can lead to more mistakes with the former. While some argue for keeping things consistent with what is already done, the switch to millis from bitcoins, the same argument does not apply to micros. The subjective nature of this debate makes it difficult to come to a universal agreement, but merchants have the option of rounding prices before presenting them to customers. Some wallets also have features that make digits beyond two decimal places smaller for precision while still maintaining a similar appearance to what users expect. Ultimately, the main argument for using mBTC seems to be the fact that some people are already accustomed to it.</p>
