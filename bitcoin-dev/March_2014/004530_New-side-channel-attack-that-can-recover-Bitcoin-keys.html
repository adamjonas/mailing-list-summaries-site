    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eric Lombrozo agrees that the FLUSH+RELOAD attack is not the weakest link in security for Bitcoin, as there are easier targets that can be exploited. However, he notes that this particular thread is discussing this specific attack vector and that his suggestion is relevant to this thread. Meanwhile, James Hartig argues that using n-of-m multisig instead of single factor Bitcoin addresses adds only a minor amount of security, since if someone manages to hack into a "hot wallet" server, they can still steal all the bitcoins in that wallet by initiating a non-multisig transaction. He suggests that there is no sufficient way to prevent someone from stealing all the money once they have access to the server.</p>
