    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer suggests that changing to mBTC due to the state currency's price for Bitcoin is a valid option, but it may not be favored by users who do not like changes. To maintain a good standard, the author proposes building it on standards such as SI and backed by best practices. The user should never be forced to take an option they cannot change, and changes should not be made without their permission. Furthermore, the system should take care of users who make mistakes when entering values. Currently, a good standard is having Bitcoin as BTC with eight decimal places or using uBTC with XBT as a symbol for compatibility with other software. In regions where decimal places in prices are uncommon, satoshis can be used with SI prefixes if numbers are too big. The writer prefers making the choice transparent to users and setting a standard where the user can use all available decimal places. Additionally, there should be a set of official test cases for wallet software to ensure desired behavior.</p>
