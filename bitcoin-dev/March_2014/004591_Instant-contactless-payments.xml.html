    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on 03/10/2014, Alex Kotenko expressed the need to switch to BIP70 as soon as possible. The main hurdle towards achieving this is the lack of support for the protocol among wallets. Currently, only Andreas' Wallet supports it, but even within that wallet, it is only available as a "LABS feature" that will be turned off for most users. However, there is a small clarification to be made here. Bitcoin Wallet has been supporting the customer side of the protocol since 2011 without any "Labs enabling". This means they have an install base of half a million devices that can interoperate with BIP70. While a lot of users may have Bluetooth switched off, the UI flow to enable it while paying is quite smooth. The merchant side of the protocol used to require Labs enabling, but this has been done away with in recent weeks.</p>
