    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation from March 2nd, 2014, Troy Benjegerdes requested a clear design document to trade between two chains so he could develop the code to start trading cats and dogs and bits. The discussion then moves on to the importance of accurate historic market data and whether it's necessary for buying and selling commodities such as corn, fertilizer, and electricity. While some argue that the primary goal of markets is trade itself rather than price discovery, others point out that people who take money from buyers and sellers care most about accurate historic market data. Despite these debates, Benjegerdes reiterates his request for working code for cross-chain trades and suggests focusing on the accurate historic data problem later. The discussion ultimately ends with links to Jorge Timón's website.</p>
