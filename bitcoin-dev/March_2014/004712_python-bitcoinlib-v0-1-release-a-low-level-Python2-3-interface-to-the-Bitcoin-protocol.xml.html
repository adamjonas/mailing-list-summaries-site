    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread started with Drak asking Jeff Garzik if it made sense to pull in some stuff and add Peter with commit access since his repo was at the top of the fork tree. Jeff replied that he is happy to do whatever makes the new maintainer and users most happy, including giving the new maintainer commit privs in his repo. Peter Todd then released v0.1 of python-bitcoinlib, which provides an easy interface to the bitcoin data structures and protocol. The library has support for data-structures related to transactions, scripting, addresses, and keys and includes Bitcoin Core RPC support. However, p2p network related code is not in a good state as it lacks unittests. The release and others in the future are signed by Peter's PGP key, as well as every publicly pushed commit.Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist who works at BitPay. He said that he is glad to see this with a more active maintainer and that maintaining three client libs was a bit much for him. Finally, the email included a call to action from O'Reilly Books to download their free book on Graph Databases.</p>
