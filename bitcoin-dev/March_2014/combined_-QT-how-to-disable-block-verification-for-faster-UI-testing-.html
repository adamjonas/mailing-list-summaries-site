        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Angel Leon and Wladimir, the issue of database corruption while developing the UI for Bitcoin-Qt was discussed. Angel mentioned that when he opens the official binary, there is a database corruption problem which leads to the need for reindexing blocks on disk, a process that can take up to a day. Wladimir suggested a solution by using separate Bitcoin data directories and making copies before performing risky actions. He also recommended using the -regtest option to quickly set up test scenarios. He cautioned against switching between 0.8.x and 0.9.x versions with the same directory as it may cause database problems. To support his point, Wladimir provided a link to the downgrading warning in the README.txt file located at <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt.Angel">https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt.Angel</a> clarified that he was not testing anything specific, but rather coding, building, and launching repeatedly. He expressed a desire to make the startup of the Qt client faster. Angel's Twitter handle, @gubatron, was mentioned at the end of the conversation.In summary, the conversation revolved around the issue of database corruption while developing the UI for Bitcoin-Qt. Wladimir suggested using separate Bitcoin data directories, making copies, and using the -regtest option for testing scenarios. He also warned against switching between different versions with the same directory. Angel, who was not testing anything specific, wanted to improve the startup speed of the Qt client. The context was posted by Angel on Twitter at @gubatron.</p>
