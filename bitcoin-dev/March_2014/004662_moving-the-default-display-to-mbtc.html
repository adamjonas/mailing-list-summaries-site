    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the Bitcoin community, there has been a discussion on whether to use uBTC or mBTC as the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin. Some members of the community agree that a decimal shift would be beneficial, but there has been no consensus on how many decimals to use. Bitcoin Wallet had moved to mBTC, which was disappointing to some members who believed uBTC was the consensus. Moving to muBTC would require a more coordinated educational effort. BitPay was planning to coordinate messaging and rollout with others in the community for uBTC internally, but it seems they will proceed with mBTC. Multiple unit changes negatively impact users, so it is best to settle on one unit of measurement. The expectation is that uBTC will be planned for after the next price spike to $10KUSD or whatever, and then plan on rolling back to mBTC when the price crashes from altcoin money supply inflation competition.</p>
