        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On March 13, 2014, Jack Scott proposed a method to generate a Bitcoin private key using a physical key in conjunction with image recognition software and a PIN. The idea is to use edge detection software applied to incoming video feed to convert the shape of a physical key into an equation that describes the key. The hash of the key's equation plus a user-generated five-digit pin can then be used to create a Bitcoin private key. However, Wladimir pointed out some practical issues with the proposal. Physical keys are vulnerable to photography-based reproduction attacks, and computer vision algorithms' output is notoriously noisy, making it difficult to reproduce if used as input for hashing a private key. Additionally, physical objects may deform over time.The proposal received interest from Brooks, who suggested that a real-world "key" would be less secure than a Bitcoin/PGP "key". However, he acknowledged that a physical/visual "key" could be any complex, high-contrast image, like a motion tracking target. He recommended that the standard should enforce some minimum level of complexity to prevent simple and easy-to-reproduce/steal keys. Additionally, he suggested that if the level of complexity required was high, it would be better to have a QR code of the private key instead.Overall, the proposed method for generating a Bitcoin private key involves using a physical key, edge detection software, and a PIN. While the idea was submitted as part of the standard track for BIP XX by Jack Scott on March 13, 2014, it remains an idea and has not been implemented yet.</p>
