    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, an individual known for his deep understanding of Bitcoin concepts and positive technical insight is being criticized for his communication style on the Bitcoin community list. Though he offers a lot to the community, his corrosive language and frequent ridicule of posts make it a hostile environment to discuss things. Jeff Garzik, another member of the community has also commented on Peter's negative attitude towards Bitcoin and how it has turned off other developers from participating interactively. This isn't a new problem for open-source projects as they have struggled with contributors who simultaneously make useful contributions and turn others away with their abrasive or hostile attitudes. To tackle this problem, Mike suggested introducing an openly stated moderation policy on the community list. Alan agrees with the need for some kind of moderation and is in favor of a friendly environment for technical discussions, even if it means losing additional technical insight from individuals like Peter Todd. He believes that people who explicitly insult other contributors' intelligence and character on a public list should be subject to some kind of negative reinforcement, but there may be solutions other than outright banning.</p>
