    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the topic of changing the unit of measurement for Bitcoin. It is mentioned that a change would only be necessary in case of a sub-satoshi hardfork, which is not expected to happen anytime soon. The decision should not be based on assumptions about the future price of Bitcoin. The conversation then turns towards the use of different currencies and how they make up the bulk of the Bitcoin user base. The popularity of mBTC is questioned as an ad populum fallacy, but it is argued that saying it's already popular and would take work to change is not a fallacy. The conversation ends with a suggestion to visit various services and convince them to switch to a new unit of measurement.</p>
