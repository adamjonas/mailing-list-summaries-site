    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a communication from 2014, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn discussed the use of milli- and micro- notation for currency units. He noted that it was not well supported and suggested the use of 1 XBT == 1 uBTC instead. However, he also pointed out that some people had already started using XBT to mean the same as BTC, which could lead to confusion and mistakes if software started to redefine it. Hearn argued that using uBTC would be beneficial because it would make it easier to catch errors in transactions and avoid sending too much or too little money by mistake. Ultimately, the consensus was to implement the change, and Hearn planned to ensure that uBTC was included in the next Armory release.</p>
