    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from March 29th, 2014, Brian C. Goss, a physician and BitCoin enthusiast, asked if it was possible to collect dust into a transaction with no outputs or put it in an anyone can spend transaction. He noted that the large number of signatures for large n would make the transaction size large, but if enough dust were present, it might be worth propagating to a pool's hash power. Another individual responded, suggesting that a standard output type for sending the entire transaction to miner fees would make even large transactions propagate that would normally be dropped by fee/kB rules. The email thread contained attachments for an encrypted key and signature.</p>
