    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation from March 1, 2014, is off-topic for the mailing list, but it discusses issues such as the importance of accurate historic market data, Bitcoin's payment network, and the potential for market manipulation. The discussion centers around whether or not a Bitmessage-like network would be vulnerable to a Sybil attack, which is the fundamental problem with marketplaces. One participant argues that markets are primarily about trade rather than price discovery, while another asserts that people who take money from buyers and sellers care most about accurate historic market data. Ultimately, the participants agree that cross-chain trades are necessary, and that the accurate historic data problem can be addressed later.</p>
