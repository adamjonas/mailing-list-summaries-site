    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange from 2014, members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discuss the issue of refunds in relation to BIP70. The PaymentRequest does not specify whether refunds are possible, meaning wallets have to either never submit refund data or always submit it even if it makes no sense. Additionally, the EU Distance Selling Directive only specifies a minimum of seven days for returns, with some countries allowing more. Roy Badami suggests that the latest possible deadline for returning goods for a refund could be up to 30 days to execute the order plus "at least 7 days", with some countries allowing more. Mike Hearn proposes a fixed expiry time of 2.5 years (30 months) to comply with the EU DSD and allow for some time to ship the product back and forth. However, they also consider the potential impact on RAM usage. Ultimately, they agree on a couple of months as a reasonable timeframe for merchants to comply with the EU DSD while keeping RAM usage in check until a more sophisticated refund scheme can be developed.</p>
