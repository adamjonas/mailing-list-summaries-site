    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author states that the general approach to interaction design in Bitcoin assumes minimal to no difference between payer and payee, which they generally agree with. However, for the author's PoS development, this assumption is wrong by default, as PoS is a specialized hardware and those who buy and install it are likely not in the same situation as those who didn't care to invest in anything dedicated. From the PoS point of view, there is a customer and a merchant, and the author's goal is to make things work assuming a fast and reliable connection on the merchant side and no connection requirement at all from the customer side. The author cites examples of places where cellphone connection isn't good enough for reliable Bitcoin operation, but if we're talking about merchant establishments, private local WiFi or wired connections can be used. Therefore, the author is designing their use case around this scenario and Bluetooth-based BIP70 implementation is important. Finally, the author partly agrees with Mike on user interface and IOU idea, but currently has no intention to implement anything like that.</p>
