    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on March 29, 2014, Matt Whitlock expressed interest in working on a BIP for Threshold ECDSA, but cited limited understanding of the concept and lack of public information as barriers. He instead proposed Shamir Secret Sharing BIP as an easily implemented alternative that could be used immediately with no changes to existing Bitcoin software. Devrandom acknowledged the merits of this idea, but noted that multisig was already gaining popularity in the ecosystem. However, Blockchain.info wallets were still unable to send to P2SH addresses at that time, which hindered progress on a Bitcoin project that devrandom had been working on for several months. This issue inspired him to create the Shamir Secret Sharing implementation.</p>
