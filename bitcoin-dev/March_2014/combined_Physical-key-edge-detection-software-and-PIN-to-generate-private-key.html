        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jack Scott proposed a method to generate a Bitcoin private key using a physical key, image recognition software, and a PIN. This proposal was submitted under BIP XX titled "Physical key / edge detection software and PIN to generate a Bitcoin private key" on March 13, 2014. The idea is to convert the shape of a physical key into an equation that describes the key by utilizing edge detection software applied to an incoming video feed. The resulting equation, along with a user-generated five-digit PIN, can be hashed to create a Bitcoin private key.Brooks showed interest in the proposal but raised concerns about the security of a real-world "key" compared to a Bitcoin/PGP "key". He acknowledged that a physical/visual "key" could be any complex, high-contrast image, such as a motion tracking target. He suggested that the standard should enforce a minimum level of complexity to prevent the use of simple and easily reproducible/stealable keys. Additionally, he recommended using a QR code instead if a high level of complexity was required.In an email exchange, Wladimir pointed out practical issues with the proposed method. He noted that physical keys are vulnerable to reproduction attacks based on photography and that computer vision algorithms often produce noisy output. Using a physical key as input for hashing a private key may make it difficult or even impossible to reproduce. Furthermore, physical objects like keys may deform over time, adding another challenge to this method.In conclusion, the proposed method for generating a Bitcoin private key involves utilizing a physical key, edge detection software, and a PIN. The shape of the physical key is converted into an equation using image recognition software that applies edge detection to an incoming video feed. The resulting equation, combined with a user-generated five-digit PIN, can be hashed to create a Bitcoin private key. However, practical considerations such as security vulnerabilities and potential deformations of physical objects need to be addressed before implementing this method.</p>
