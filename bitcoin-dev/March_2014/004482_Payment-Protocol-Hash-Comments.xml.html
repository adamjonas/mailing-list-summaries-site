    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread begins with a discussion on adding support for SHA-2 algorithm in PHP. Drak mentions that PHP does support SHA-2, contradicting Mike Hearn's previous statement that PHP can't do SHA-2. Jeremy Spilman then provides some comments on the Payment message hashing process mentioned in BIP70. He suggests making the field to be hashed clear and explicit, as well as retiring SHA1 since it is being phased out. In addition, he asks if there should be a way for end-users to view details such as the pki_type and certificate chain. The discussion ends with a note from Mike regarding the need for a living version of the payment protocol document, as reverse engineering the current spec by manually reading all the BIPs and layering them in one's head is not feasible.</p>
