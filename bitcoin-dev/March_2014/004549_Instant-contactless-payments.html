    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the implementation of Bluetooth and NFC technology in wallets and point-of-sale (POS) systems. Andreas Schildbach confirms that supporting Bluetooth is optional, but it's better to go for it. However, he emphasizes the need to support all major wallets and mentions that no other wallets support NFC or Bluetooth. While Bluetooth support for POS is not an issue, getting support among hardware and software with a polished user experience is essential. Regarding receipts, Schildbach clarifies that he generates PDF on the server and sends only the URL via NFC, which is likely to change before the launch of the product. The ideal scenario would be for the device to be entirely autonomous, controlled by the merchant using an app on their phone. Currently, there's a backend server that provides merchants with dashboard access to device configuration control, transaction history, daily reconciliation data, and copies of receipts. Although they should avoid the second tap, the payment proofs and receipts should be understandable and usable by both payers and payees. Implementing proof of payment based on BIP70 payment request+transaction in the blockchain+memo would require significant changes in the merchant's view and additional software. In practice, implementing a PDF-based paperless process would be more viable initially.</p>
