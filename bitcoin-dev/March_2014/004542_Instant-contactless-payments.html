    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Mike Hearn discusses the use of iso-dep for a payment system via cell phone. However, he is unsure if it is a good option because the connection breaks as soon as the phone is picked up. He suggests that if the phone cannot immediately authorize, then HTTPS or Bluetooth could be used instead. The memo field in the payment system needs to be verified since it is part of the contract. Mike thinks only the amount and destination are relevant for risk analysis. The Android Beam protocol is bypassed by IsoDep based protocols. Mike claims that everything except Beam bypasses Beam. Finally, Mike talks about his negative experience with the Oyster payment system in London, which he describes as a complete disaster due to its long wait times and excessive tracking.</p>
