    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jan Vornberger and Alex Kotenko discuss the use of NFC (Near Field Communication) for Bitcoin transactions. Kotenko shares a video demonstrating how NFC is currently used with XBTerminal, which Vornberger finds interesting but questions the transaction speeds. Vornberger believes that sending transactions solely over the Bitcoin network should be a last resort due to its longer transaction times. He suggests switching to BIP70 as soon as possible, but acknowledges the lack of wallet support as an obstacle. Vornberger also shares a video of a prototype system that uses NFC to pick up payment details and Bluetooth to transmit the transaction back. He notes that while NFC works well for getting payment details, he is skeptical about using it for the back-channel. Additionally, Vornberger sees Bluetooth as a potential issue for usability due to users turning it off and perceiving it as insecure. He suggests the ability to control Bluetooth state automatically from within the wallet app with user permission as a solution, but is unsure if it's possible on Android.</p>
