        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers have discovered that secure two-way pegging between side chains is possible with some changes to bitcoin. This allows interoperability, as users can move bitcoin into and out of a side chain. The side chain may have different parameters or experimental features subject to a minimum compatibility level that enables the production of an SPV proof of a given form. Greg Maxwell proposed a compact way to do two-way pegging using SPV proofs last year, which also provides a security firewall.In an email dated March 16, 2014, Adam Back discussed the process of moving coins to a side-chain by spending them on a script that suspends them and allows them to be reanimated by producing an SPV proof of burn on the side-chain. However, this process can be cumbersome due to security requirements, resulting in large and slow transactions. Atomic cross-chain transactions can be used instead of direct movement across chains. The use of cross chain swapping requires an untrusted counterparty on the other chain, while two-way peg migrations can be performed alone for providing liquidity and balancing demand. Adam Back proposed the term "fraud proof" for a SPV proof with a longer chain, but Jorge Timón suggested that "reorg proof" would be more appropriate since reorganizations can happen without any fraud. Timón also proposed the possibility of pegging a side-chain to a private chain, which could allow for higher scaling while retaining bitcoin security properties. However, he noted that requiring a side chain proof of burn to move back to the side chain could lock funds by the dishonest private chain operator, and instead suggested allowing unilateral withdrawals to impose on the private chain the task of observing the side chain looking for double-spends. Timón referred to freimarkets terminology in his discussion.It's worth noting that the provided links include information on fast atomic cross-chain transactions and CoinSwap as a trustless trading option. Bitcoin has no mining reward on the beta chain network but allows users to mint coins at no mining cost by providing an SPV proof that the coin has been suspended in bitcoin. The use of two-way pegging and other related techniques can help with scalability and interoperability between different chains, improving the overall functionality of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
