    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Bitcoin core developers Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik on March 12, 2014, concerns were raised about partially signed and multisig transactions within bitcoind. Specifically, Garzik noted that such transactions would go through the raw transaction API, which would not adjust fees if the signature pushes the transaction to a higher fee level. This could lead to issues for developers writing apps that rely on this functionality. In response, Hearn suggested that the need for implementing the fee loop in one's own app highlights the importance of carefully documenting this aspect of the raw transaction API on the website for Bitcoin developers. Additionally, Garzik pointed out that developer sipa had proposed a more useful raw transaction API call that would calculate fees and other details automatically. The link to this proposal is provided along with Garzik's title as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</p>
