    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 8, 2014, Alan Reiner wrote an email discussing creating a new key pair and not sharing it with others. He stated that he could create any arbitrary key pair, but only share the minus version, as he had seen this done before. He then explained that even though someone may not know his private key, it would not matter because he could still abuse it. In response to this, Edmund Edgar suggested that parties must exchange their public keys before combining them to avoid this type of situation from occurring. Edmund Edgar is the founder of Social Minds Inc and is associated with Reality Keys.</p>
