    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In March 2014, a user named vv01f posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list asking about a solution for users who want to have their vanity addresses easily found and verified. The current method involves signing their own addresses and quoting them in forums, but this centralized storage is not secure and signed messages could be swapped easily with the next forum hack. The user suggested using PGP keyservers, but that would only work for single vanity addresses. They also proposed webfinger as part of a solution where servers of a business can tell and prove if a specific address is owned by them. Links to Bitcointalk forum discussions are provided as reference for the issue at hand. The question posed is whether this use case is already taken care of in any plans. The mention of BIP70 covering this via Certificate Authorities is made, but it is unclear if this solves the problem entirely.</p>
