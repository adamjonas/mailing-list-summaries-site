    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>MultiBit plans to put all future protocol development, except for critical security and network compatibility fixes, into a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet. The company aims to retire MultiBit Classic eventually and ensure that HD is fully superseded. Although HD is not yet available, there are ongoing efforts among wallet developers to harmonize on its implementation through BIP32/39. As a result, the presence of HD is likely to rise quickly or possibly become dominant by the time this protocol sees widespread use. MultiBit expects to release HD code within two months, with private beta occurring within weeks. Trezor and Electrum may release it earlier than MultiBit. Hive and Haskoin are also committed to HD. Meanwhile, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik believes that it's premature to build anything on top of HD until major user wallets and bitcoind have basic HD support, given the difficulty in rolling out HD.</p>
