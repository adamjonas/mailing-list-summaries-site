    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the compatibility of 2-way peg and merged mining. The writer argues that merged mining is not necessary for implementing a tree-chain system and can lead to security issues. They also suggest that instead of calling it inflation, demurrage should be used in the case of pegged coins. The writer further explains the potential risks involved in merged mining, such as draining the pegging pool, but suggests quieting periods and provides an example of how merged mining can help solve scalability problems indirectly. The discussion also delves into the possibility of reducing dependence on miner validation through ZK-SNARKS. Overall, the conversation highlights various perspectives on the topic and weighs the pros and cons of different approaches.</p>
