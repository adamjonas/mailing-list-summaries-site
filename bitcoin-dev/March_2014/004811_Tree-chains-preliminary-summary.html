    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread revolves around the need for moderation on the bitcoin-development mailing list. Some members, including Alan Reiner and Jeff Garzik, suggest that Peter Todd's communication style is hostile and corrosive, making it a scary place to discuss technicals. They propose a solution of some sort of negative reinforcement, like introducing an openly stated moderation policy. Meanwhile, Troy Benjegerdes criticizes companies that exploit naive end-users and highlights the importance of vocal points on the mailing list. He suggests that sleazy people take advantage of nice people and that moderators should consider pointing out obvious flaws rather than ignoring them. The conversation also includes a signed message from Peter Todd, which offers to pay respect in exchange for not being accused of having ulterior motives.</p>
