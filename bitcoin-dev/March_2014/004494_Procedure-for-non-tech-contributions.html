    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Tom Geller stated that he is a non-developer writer with experience in open-source communities and would like to contribute to the Bitcoin project through writing, editing, and marketing. He asked about the procedure for doing so and if there is someone in charge of that area. In response, another member suggested submitting changes via pull-req on GitHub or sending a text-file with corrections applied for proofreading even if someone doesn't know how to use git. Tom also raised a concern regarding the information on the Bitcoin Payment page on the Bitcoin wiki, which states that "the wiki receiving wallet (for the wiki itself) is also MtGox." Another member replied that MtGox does host the Bitcoin wiki, so the funds probably do go to a wallet held by MtGox in some fashion.</p>
