        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of this context has written a whitepaper that proposes a method for securing hardware wallets from compromise using a "Warden" computer. Hardware wallets are a tempting target for attackers due to their wide adoption, and the potential for malware to be inserted into the hardware or software, or for the random seed to be generated in a predictable way. The proposed solution involves using a separate computer to manage the wallet and protect private keys from compromise. The author is requesting feedback on the whitepaper and believes that it has the potential to be turned into a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The whitepaper can be found in full on GitHub. It discusses how a Warden computer can be used to keep the private keys secure and how this system could be implemented by users of hardware wallets. Overall, the whitepaper aims to address the security concerns surrounding hardware wallets, which have become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of storing cryptocurrency. By proposing a new method for securing these wallets, the author hopes to provide a valuable contribution to the Bitcoin community and improve the overall security of the network.</p>
