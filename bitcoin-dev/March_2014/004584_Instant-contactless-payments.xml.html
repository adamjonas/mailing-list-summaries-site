    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the experience of using contactless NFC payments in Canada and Switzerland. In Canada, the maximum limit for transactions using NFC payments is $50 and can be used for paying smaller amounts as well. The user has been using it every day to pay for breakfast, and it works smoothly through their wallet even with multiple NFC enabled cards in it. However, in Switzerland, the experience isn't quite good due to its failure rate of 75%, which is based on the use of the author. The biggest issue is that merchants often require a minimum payment size before accepting credit cards, which is usually high. Thus, there is an incredibly thin price range in which the simple touch-to-pay system actually works. Most of the time, either they reject cards entirely because the payment is too small or require a PIN because the payment is too large. The author believes that Bitcoin can do better than this.</p>
