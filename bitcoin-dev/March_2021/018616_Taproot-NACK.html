    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Taproot continues, with a response from Keagan arguing that there is no value in specifying other possible conditions that could have moved the coins when spending a P2SH output. LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH responds to this, stating that the ability to scrutinize the public ledger is not the same as hiding information. He likens it to showing your palm while pointing at the back of your hand. He also notes that P2SH is scrutable once the UTXO is spent and creating new addresses does not obfuscate the public ledger, but may reduce transaction linkage. The original email thread was started by Ryan Grant, who pointed out that the obfuscation achieved by generating a new address for payment is no different from options available in P2SH.</p>
