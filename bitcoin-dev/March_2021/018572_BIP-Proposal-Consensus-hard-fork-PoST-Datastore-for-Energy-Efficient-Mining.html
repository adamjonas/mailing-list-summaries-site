    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member of the Lonero Foundation proposed a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to address energy efficiency issues in Bitcoin mining. However, another member discouraged this proposal, citing prior discussions in the community that have rejected similar proposals. They provided links to BIP 2 which outlines the BIP process and a blog post arguing for the value of Proof of Work. The discussion then shifted to whether or not technically well-constructed proposals that are guaranteed to be rejected should be allowed in the BIP repository. It was suggested that the BIP Editor should unilaterally reject such proposals as spam without comment but maintain a moderation log to ensure transparency and prevent censorship. The bitcoin-dev moderation log is already public and available for anyone to subscribe to.</p>
