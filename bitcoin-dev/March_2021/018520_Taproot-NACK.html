    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH has expressed concerns about Taproot, a proposed protocol change for Bitcoin that could increase privacy on the chain. However, he believes that maintaining transparency and consensus values on the blockchain is more important than increased privacy. He also argues that the use of Bitcoin mixers can provide standard equivalent privacy for honest individuals who are not trying to hide their financial affairs from government audits. In response to his concerns, Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces questions the authenticity of his claims, as LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH promotes a Bitcoin mixer in his signature without proper disclosure of his affiliation. Jeremy Rubin, however, assures him that Taproot does not enable Monero-like privacy features, and existing techniques such as coinjoin and lightning already allow for transaction graph obfuscation. Despite this, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH maintains his stance and offers a full NACK if Taproot enables transactions to be obfuscated from scrutiny. He asserts that the honesty and transparency of Bitcoin's core functionality must remain unaltered to prevent governments from banning it.</p>
