        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list brought up the issue of potential risks of quantum computing on Bitcoin and its impact on Taproot. Luke Dashjr raised concerns about Taproot losing an important safety protection against quantum, which could become an unrecoverable situation if QC goes online before a full quantum-safe solution is in place. Matt Corallo pointed out that any "pause" to solve the issue would not work due to address reuse. The storage space required for Taproot transactions is reduced by avoiding the hash indirection. However, Jeremy clarified that there is no storage benefit with Signature and Message, and there may be additional costs associated with revealing P.Despite all this, Matt Corallo does not intend any of this as a NACK of Taproot and believes that any QC issues in Bitcoin need to be solved in another way. Karl-Johan Alm also discussed the possibility of breaking ECC key using quantum techniques, but it falls apart once it is noted that any QC-wielding attacker could steal Bitcoin due to address reuse.Luke Dashjr believes that adding a hash on top in an additional soft fork should be straightforward and it's not a reason to NACK Taproot. Meanwhile, having multiple quantum computers makes it easier to make attempts more frequently. However, a "slow" attack does not seem likely as it would take longer to maintain the quantum state. But, if an attacker could work quickly but unreliably, they could maintain the quantum state for a minute per attempt with only a 0.0016% chance of success.</p>
