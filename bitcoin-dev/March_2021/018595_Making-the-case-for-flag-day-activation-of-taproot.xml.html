    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation discusses the best approach for activating the Taproot upgrade on Bitcoin's network. The proposal is to proceed with a flag day activation, which would release a code to activate Taproot and take the pressure off further BIP8 LOT=false work. While technically idempotent, this approach adds complexity and risks normalizing consensus rule diversity on the network. There is concern about users pushing for UASF-style forced-signaling faster-activation, leading to divergent consensus rules on the network. However, it is acknowledged that anyone can join and run whatever consensus rules they want on an open network. The responsibility falls on the community to ensure that ill-informed transactors running such software are not screwed out of their Bitcoin. The most conservative action is not to activate Taproot at all, but it is unlikely to solve the issue. Several plausible paths towards activation are still open, and forthcoming PRs will be looked at with optimism.</p>
