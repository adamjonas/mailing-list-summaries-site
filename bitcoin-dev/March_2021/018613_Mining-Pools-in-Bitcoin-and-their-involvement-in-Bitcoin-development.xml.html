    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email provides facts about mining pool distribution in the last 24 hours with Binance, F2Pool, and Huobi being the top three. Most pools have been reusing addresses for coinbase transaction and sharing names in coinbase text. The author refrains from commenting on the origin of these mining pools or history but mentions that few countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Pakistan have recently increased their involvement in Bitcoin mining along with China, US and some others who were already involved. The email highlights the rewards and risks associated with Bitcoin mining and discusses the opportunities provided when mining pools agree/disagree on some soft fork. The author also mentions possible issues related to mining pools that need to be planned accordingly. The email ends on a positive note by discussing Satoshi's lesson that one does not need to be the next Einstein or have much money or influence with the world's "movers & shakers" to change the world; they just need to put in the effort.</p>
