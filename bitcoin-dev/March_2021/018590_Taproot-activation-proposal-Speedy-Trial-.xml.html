    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, David Harding proposed an activation timeline for Taproot. According to the proposal, the release of one or more full nodes with activation code will occur at T+0, signal tracking begins at T+14, earliest possible lock-in happens at T+28, and by T+104, lock-in must have occurred. If not, then a different activation process needs to be tried. Activation will take place on T+194 if lock-in occurs. The proposed idea can be implemented using either Bitcoin Core's BIP9 code or its proposed BIP8 patchset. Harding also shared a pull request that updates BIP9 to support an extra parameter to delay the transition from LOCKED_IN to ACTIVE until a particular timestamp is reached and reduce the activation threshold to 90%. Based on this PR, he suggested April 14, 2021, as the start time, July 14, 2021, as the timeout, and October 1, 2021, as the activation time for Taproot. Signalling for Taproot will begin with the first retarget period whose parent's median time is at least April 14th and conclude with the last retarget period whose final block's median time is prior to July 14th. Activation will be delayed until the first retarget period where the final block of the previous retarget period has a timestamp of at least October 1st.It's important to note that the timeout mentioned above is prior to the expected timestamp of the startheight block specified in the proposal for bip8 parameters and earliest activation is after the expected release of 22.0 and hence the maintenance end of 0.20. Furthermore, the PR specifies the delay as a deadline, not a delta between lock-in and activation, so earlier lock-in does not produce an earlier activation with the code referenced above.</p>
