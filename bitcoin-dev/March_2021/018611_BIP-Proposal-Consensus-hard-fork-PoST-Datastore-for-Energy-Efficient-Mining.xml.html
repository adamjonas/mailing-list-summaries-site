    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andrew has provided a link to his BIP proposal on his GitHub repository and is asking if he can submit a pull request for it on the BIPs repository. There is some discussion about the proposal, including its potential benefits, such as improving efficiency and tackling issues of NP-Completeness or Halting that could make the BTC network vulnerable in the future. Some concerns are also raised about proposing a hard fork in the hashing algorithm, which could invalidate the enormous amount of capital expenditure by mining entities and disincentivize future capital expenditure into mining hardware. There is also discussion about the negative externalities of energy expenditure in mining and the move towards renewables. The best way to handle the proposal is suggested to be submitting a pull request on GitHub using BIP #2's draft format, which can be discussed and answered in the request's comments without having to send emails to everyone. The final decision is to post the link for discussion before doing a pull request on the BIPs repo as the best way to handle it.</p>
