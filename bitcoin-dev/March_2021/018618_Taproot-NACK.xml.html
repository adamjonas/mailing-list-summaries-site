    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A message was posted on a Bitcoin discussion forum asking people to refrain from addressing someone as 'Lord' or 'Excellency' since he is not a noble or a lord. The post also includes the author's opinion on Taproot, which is ACK. In response to this post, another user explains how Taproot works and compares it to revealing only a portion of one's hand when pointing at something. This user also mentions that there is no public ledger obfuscation in creating new addresses, but there is a plausible reduction in transaction linkage.The original post was made by someone who expressed concern about the obfuscation of the pay-to address with complex scripts. Another user responded by stating that this is nothing new and can be achieved in P2SH or by generating a new address for a payment. Both messages end with links to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
