    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 2nd, a UASF (LOT=true) kick off meeting was held on the ##uasf IRC channel. The conversation log for this meeting can be found at <a href="http://gnusha.org/uasf/2021-03-02.log">http://gnusha.org/uasf/2021-03-02.log</a>. The meeting was announced on short notice at <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018515.html.It">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018515.html.It</a> is evident that frustration is building around the issue of Taproot activation and it has been discussed extensively in high-level activation discussions. There are concerns that the current environment is not conducive to development and review. It seems likely that Core will only ship BIP 8 (1 year, LOT=false) as there is no alternative available which could lead to Core shipping nothing at all.The greatest risk to Taproot dying a slow death is a small group of developers who are hindering progress by talking conservatively about endless philosophy. This is causing delays in upgrading and preparing for manageable risks later in the year. There is a trillion dollar industry waiting on this upgrade, but they are wasting time monitoring arguments instead of preparing for the upgrade.We need to give miners and users the ability to activate Taproot this year (2021). If we fail to do so through any means (Core, UASF release), it is assumed that Taproot will never activate. A UASF (LOT=true) project needs to be ready to assemble, just like it was in 2017, to ensure that a small group of individuals don't block progress. However, Core needs to be given the opportunity to ship a BIP 8 (1 year, LOT=false) activation that is well-reviewed and tested like any other Core consensus code change.Once the situation has calmed down, progress made should be revisited, and decisions taken from there.
