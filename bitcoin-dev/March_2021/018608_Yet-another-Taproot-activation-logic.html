    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Carlo Spiller, a Bitcoin user since 2014, proposed an activation proposal for Taproot on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. His proposal involves deploying with LOT=false and an activation threshold of 95% miner signaling. If after six months Taproot is not activated by MASF but at least 80% of hash power signaled for the upgrade, LOT gets a lock-in date another six months later and the threshold for MASF is lowered to 90%. If 80% is not reached, the proposal expires. The Simple Majority Activation proposal (SMA) has a final activation threshold set to 51%, which removes the incentive to do a user-activated soft fork (UASF). Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces replied to Carlo's proposal, stating that SMA is similar to Carlo's proposal, except it has the final activation threshold set to 51%. Lorenzo-Luaces also highlighted the problem with Carlo's proposal, which is that users don't know what to do if signaling is between 51% to 79%. A UASF can scare everyone else because they may be at risk of big reorgs to gain traction and followers. With the same proposal but the final threshold set to 51% instead of 80%, there can't be risk of a UASF because if 51% is not reached, they know they don't have enough miner support to keep the chain together.</p>
