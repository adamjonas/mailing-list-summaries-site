    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, the sender apologizes for using incorrect terminology when discussing asymmetric cryptography and cryptographic key validation. They plan to make clarifications and edits to avoid confusion in the future. The recipient of the email had previously expressed skepticism about the proposal, which involves expanding proof-of-work as a solution to security and sustainability issues. The recipient also made a joking reference to the possibility of artificial intelligence generating a Bitcoin improvement proposal and becoming a centralized overlord. The sender emphasized that their proposal is not intended to create a Bitcoin hardfork or replace it with an alternative, but rather to make improvements to the existing system. They are willing to provide preprints explaining the technological implementation of their proposed changes once it reaches draft status. The sender requests constructive feedback rather than insults or ridicule.</p>
