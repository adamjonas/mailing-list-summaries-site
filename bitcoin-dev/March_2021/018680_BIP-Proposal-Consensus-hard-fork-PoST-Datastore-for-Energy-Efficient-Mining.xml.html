    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the advantages of general purpose hardware over ASICS, ZmnSCPxj suggests that BOINC implements a decent distributed computing protocol which is cheaper than the competition and has decent levels of fault tolerance. He also adds that an algorithmic implementation would make HDDs and CPUs more adaptable, and while specialized hardware may be inevitable, access to other forms of computation along with ASICs should be provided. The advantage of this approach is that it spreads the optimization of SHA256d-specific hardware widely, thereby making it difficult for anyone with 2 BTC liquidity in one location to have an advantage over anyone with 2 BTC liquidity in another location. ZmnSCPxj believes that changing the underlying algorithm is an attempt to reverse history and suggests that instead of going back, we should push through and optimize SHA256d-specific hardware, as there will be fewer patentable surprises remaining with SHA256d than any newer, much more complicated construction.</p>
