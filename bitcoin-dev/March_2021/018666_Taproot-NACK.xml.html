    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread includes a discussion about the security of Conjoin or Wasabi Wallet when relying on third-parties. The sender of the email argues that no one has yet demonstrated that either is secure in such instances. However, an individual named ZmnSCPxj responds with an explanation of how CoinJoin transactions work and why they are secure against third-party manipulation. He states that CoinJoin transactions involve multiple inputs and outputs, and every input must be signed. To prevent fraud, it is necessary for each entity putting in funds to get them out as an output. Each entity verifies its address exists in some output before signing out its input, which means it is not possible to take a "partial" signature and redirect outputs elsewhere. In response to the sender's claim that transparency is crucial in preventing fraud, ZmnSCPxj argues that transparency does not mean revealing the actual values involved in cleartext. Various cryptographic techniques allow the verifiable addition of encrypted values, enabling users to voluntarily reveal information while maintaining privacy. Finally, the email includes various contact details for Willtech and other projects.</p>
