    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris Belcher, a Bitcoin developer, proposed flag day activation for Taproot, which would make it easier to activate upgrades on the Bitcoin network without being held back by miner signaling and social media drama. However, Yanmaani at cock.li raised concerns that this approach could lead to Core developers making bad changes that go against the community's wishes without giving them an option to resist without forking away. In response, Chris argued that social media drama often promotes brinkmanship and that people should represent themselves in Bitcoin by telling their software what rules they want enforced. Additionally, he gave examples of easily-resisted changes like censorship or a flag-day UASF where transactions are only confirmed if they pay a minimum of 1000 sat/vbyte in miner fees. While Yanmaani recommended using RPC command or command-line flags as alternatives to hard-coding controversial settings, Chris argued that miners won't save users from bad changes and that the ability to do a counter-UASF is the best protection. He suggested that Core should provide users with tools to express their views and exercise their economic power, while still giving them default values according to what they think is best. However, he believes that forcing people to use a forked client if they want to disobey them would be an abuse of power. Ultimately, both parties agreed that some compromise could be reached, such as requiring >95% miner support before flag day or >33% on flag day.</p>
