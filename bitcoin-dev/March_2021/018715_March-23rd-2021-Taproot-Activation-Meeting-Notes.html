    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a productive meeting, several topics were discussed. The first topic was the use of a speedy trial variant, which had no new objections. However, there was a desire to know if Rusty retracts or reaffirms his NACK in light of the responses. Additionally, there was an open question of whether Rusty's NACK remains if it is sufficiently addressed, but there is no desire to wait for his response if he does not respond.The second topic was selecting between heights and MTP, where there was no robust consensus on either. There were two NACKs, one against MTP and one against height. No one had an issue with the technical safety of MTP/heights on their own. However, there was an open question about the additional review required to ensure height-based activation is safe.In terms of parameter selection, there was broad agreement to target a May 1st release, with one week from rc1 start time/startheight, three months + delta stoptime/stopheight (6 retargetting periods), and an activation time of around Nov 15th. If heights are selected, the first signalling period would be 683424, and the stop height would be 695520. If times are selected, a mid-period MTP would be targeted, with a 1300 UTC May 7th start time and stop time of 1300 UTC August 13th. The activation height should be 707616 (about Nov 15th) for either proposal.Regarding parameter flexibility, adjustments may be necessary, but it was agreed that November 15th should remain steady as slipping past Thanksgiving turns to Christmas turns to New Years turns to Chinese New Year. There was limited belief that the release could be stretched into June if needed, but it was believed that a release with ST Taproot on the timeline suggested by topic 3 could be achieved.Lastly, simultaneous UASF was discussed, with luke-jr believing that a UASF client must be able to release before the ST client releases in order for people to use it. However, no one else shared this sentiment, and it was agreed that a UASF can proceed independently of ST. Additionally, luke-jr NACKed ST MTP, stating that ST with MTP means that UASF must release after ST releases, which limits UASF adoption. Conversely, Jeremy Rubin NACKed ST Height, stating that if using height means that we'd see a marketed push to launch a UASF client before ST is given a chance, ST fails its goal for avoiding contentious forks.</p>
