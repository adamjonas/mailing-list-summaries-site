    <p>The email discusses the importance of compliance with consensus when spending Bitcoin, stating that if details are obscured it is not possible to accept them. The writer emphasizes the need for public scrutiny and scrutability to prevent fraud and ensure fungibility. The email also includes contact information and links to various projects and profiles belonging to Damian A. James Williamson of Willtech. The email concludes with a disclaimer stating that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered. In response to the email, ZmnSCPxj asks about the specific property that needs to be proven, to which the email writer responds that the only necessary property is that the UTXO does not create more coins than what was designed.</p>
