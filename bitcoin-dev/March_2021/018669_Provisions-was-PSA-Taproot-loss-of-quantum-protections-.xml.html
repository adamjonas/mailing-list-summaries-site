    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Andrea asked for references to ring signatures over/for/via taproot and what "Provisions" means. Andrew Poelstra replied, saying that Provisions is a scheme for providing proof of ownership of funds by collecting all the Bitcoin outputs which have exposed or known public keys and associating them with a Pedersen commitment which commits to the output amounts in a homomorphic way. This essentially provides a zero-knowledge proof of owning some amount of BTC without revealing the specific UTXOs involved. However, only a small anonymity set can currently use Provisions as most unspent Bitcoin outputs do not have known public keys. Taproot outputs will be an exception because they have exposed public keys, which allows people to do Provisions proofs where their anonymity set consists of a large proportion of active coins. Andrew also shared a link to simpler things that can be done with Taproot keys along these lines.</p>
