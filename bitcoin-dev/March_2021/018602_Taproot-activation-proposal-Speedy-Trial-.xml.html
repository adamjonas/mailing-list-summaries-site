    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Michael Folkson and Matt Corallo on March 6th, they discussed the possibility of a UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) during the "Speedy Trial" deployment for Taproot activation. While Folkson couldn't control anyone other than himself, he expressed that he wouldn't support a UASF until the Speedy Trial had been completed and failed. He encouraged others to engage in discussions around the parameters for Speedy Trial being discussed on IRC. Corallo expressed concerns about the three-month time window for activation, stating that it was long enough for divergent consensus rules to be split with a significant delay prior to activation if there was a failure. He also mentioned that Bitcoin's consensus has never been decided through a single live conversation or under a few days latency. Folkson reiterated that soft forks would always contain some limited chain split risk, regardless of the activation mechanism used. He recommended that parameters should not be chosen assuming there will be a UASF during the deployment. Luke, another participant in the discussion, agreed with Folkson's stance on the matter.</p>
