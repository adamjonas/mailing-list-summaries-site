        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing activation configurations for soft forks as developers seek ways to improve the mechanisms. Four activation configurations have been discussed, and their rationales include MASF=true + LOT=false, MASF=true + LOT=true, MASF=false + LOT=informational, and MASF=true + LOT=informational. The first proposed approach involves a safe conservative method, while the second one is an inverse of the first. The third approach uses the non-standardness part of Schnorr to activate at a flag height without normative signaling in version bits but creates needless delays. The fourth approach combines MASF=true (same mechanism as 1 or 2) with LOT=informational (mechanism from 3). The Bitcoin community is considering starting with a safe conservative approach to avoid misinterpretation about developer control and being incremental in their improvements. However, there are concerns about perpetuating a normative mechanism as a political veto, which could be overridden by the market but increases drama and risk. There were also concerns about offending miners, but pools indicated ~90% support and are less detail-oriented. Against the realism of developer control, if there were a market need to reject a soft-fork, that can also be done with a UASF.Disagreement and potential for partly incompatible clients with different activation configuration change the risk calculation for LOT=false. Therefore, LOT=false may not be safer in practice, and it does not wash reference client developers' hands of contributing to the combined risk. If LOT=true is a hidden flag in bitcoin reference code or released by another project, then misinterpretation of developer control is avoided. Subsequent posts on the thread with the third proposal discuss that informational signaling be substituted so that users and the market can benefit from the information about miner intent. In some way, it could be more reliable in signaling a willing readiness rather than a UASF under duress mandatory signal.The community is discussing different combinations of MASF and LOT, considering reliability and informing the ecosystem about a hashrate verified opt-in assertion of readiness from pools. In the event that activation were unreasonably delayed, forced miner signaling could be argued to be less reliable as the mechanism for signaling on pools has no automated link to fullnode software version. Users and services would be well advised to ensure they are running schnorr validating full-nodes, and for SPV users to verify their wallet relies on schnorr upgraded full-nodes. The delay itself may motivate users to switch to clients with MASF+UASF (LOT=true) in protest.</p>
