    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A troll named James has been causing quite a stir on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. James, who claims to hold noble titles in both Scotland and England, as well as having records in Australia, introduced himself with a lengthy email explaining his titles and insisting that he has never been a prince. Some members of the list suspect that his behavior is merely subtle mockery. Others have pointed out that his titles are not recognized by any official organizations, and that he shouldn't be given any more attention than an average person would receive. Meanwhile, Aymeric Vitte, a software developer based in Sophia-Antipolis, France, has shared some tools and projects related to Bitcoin transactions and wallets on the mailing list.</p>
