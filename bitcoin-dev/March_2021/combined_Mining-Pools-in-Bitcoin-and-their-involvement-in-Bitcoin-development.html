        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email provides information regarding the distribution of mining pools in the last 24 hours, with Binance, F2Pool, and Huobi being the top three. The majority of pools have been reusing addresses for coinbase transactions and sharing names in coinbase text. The author refrains from commenting on the origin or history of these mining pools but mentions that countries such as Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Pakistan have recently increased their involvement in Bitcoin mining, along with China, the US, and others who were already involved.The email discusses the rewards and risks associated with Bitcoin mining and highlights the opportunities provided when mining pools agree/disagree on some soft fork. The author also mentions possible issues related to mining pools that need to be planned accordingly.The email ends on a positive note by discussing Satoshi's lesson that one does not need to be the next Einstein or have much money or influence with the world's "movers & shakers" to change the world; they just need to put in the effort.</p>
