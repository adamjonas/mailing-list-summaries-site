    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent discussion on a bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around coordinating activation and the potential for miner veto. One member claimed that miners could not successfully veto a BIP 9 activation in 2017, but another member argued that this was not a valid argument. The conversation also touched on soft-forks, with one member explaining that old node software continues to work regardless of activation signaling. Additionally, the discussion covered the potential for chain splits with different levels of enforcement (LOT). While one member argued that LOT=True is the safest option, another member pointed out that LOT=False is the default behavior of every single piece of node software and therefore already universal. Overall, the discussion highlighted key considerations for activating changes in the Bitcoin network and the potential risks involved.</p>
