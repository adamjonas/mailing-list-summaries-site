    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new proposal has been put forward in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list by Carlo Spiller, which proposes a change to the activation threshold for Taproot. The proposal suggests an initial deployment with LOT=false and an activation threshold of 95% of miner signaling. If after six months Taproot is not activated by MASF, but at least 80% of hashpower signaled for the upgrade, LOT gets a lock-in date another six months later, and the threshold for MASF is lowered to 90%. However, if after the initial six months of signaling with LOT=false, 80% is not reached, the proposal expires. The problem with the proposal is that users cannot activate Taproot if signaling is between 51% to 79%. The users that want to promote a UASF know that their miner majority can activate Taproot and activate without the 21% to 49% of miners needing to signal. A UASF movement needs to hard fork anyway to change the PoW (for protection) and change addresses to prevent double spends if support is less than 50%. A UASF with a miner majority can scare everyone else about them being at risk of big reorgs to gain traction and followers. Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces suggests that SMA proposal with 51% removes the incentive to do a UASF.</p>
