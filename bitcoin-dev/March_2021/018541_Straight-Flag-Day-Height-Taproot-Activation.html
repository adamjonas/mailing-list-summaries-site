    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns, a Bitcoin Core developer, suggests updating getblocktemplate so that miners can signal uptake for a few retarget periods before activation without any consensus-level effect. This will allow miners and businesses to adjust their expectations for how much hashpower might not be enforcing taproot rules when generating blocks, potentially allowing miners to switch pools to one running an up-to-date node, reduce the amount of time spent mining on top of unvalidated headers, increase confirmation requirements, or prepare for the possibility of an increase in invalid-block entries in their logs. Another developer agrees that this is a worthwhile change, but also notes that it may require pool updates to ensure that the pool server software does not assume the 32-byte-0-nonce currently in wide use. This change would avoid the need to change pool software for future forks that place commitments in the nonce.There is discussion about the critical goal of high node-level adoption in a BIP 8 approach, which is currently in jeopardy. Some developers disagree on the implementation of lot=false, which could cause drama and lead to a minority group threatening to fork off onto a lot=true chain. There is uncertainty about whether the minority group is large enough to consider, but there is still a risk involved.</p>
