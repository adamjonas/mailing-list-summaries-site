    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user asked whether a proposed HD wallet scheme is safe to implement. The proposed scheme involves using an offset to derive child keys from a master private key, rather than simply incrementing the key as in some existing schemes. One respondent agreed that the intuition behind the proposal was sound, but raised concerns about the predictability of the offset and the possibility of deriving a parent private key from a child private key. They suggested that BIP 32, which addresses these concerns, would be a more practical solution. Another respondent noted that the security goals of the proposed scheme had not been specified, and cautioned against assuming safety based on a brief description.</p>
