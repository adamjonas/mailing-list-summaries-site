    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, clarified that his recent comments were not meant to be a negative response to Taproot. Matt Corallo, another developer, expressed concern over the security of hash-based addresses in light of quantum computing. However, he acknowledged that discouraging address use is still possible as a social effort. He also noted that progress has been made in the past nine years, but not enough to have an impact on the overall system's QC security. In response to the idea that QC owners could steal coins, there is debate about how quickly this would happen. Regardless, it does not equate to mining and would not be seen as acceptable since many old outputs still have owners with the keys.</p>
