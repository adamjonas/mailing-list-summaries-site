        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers have proposed a new activation method called Speedy Trial to determine whether Taproot, a protocol upgrade aimed at improving the network's privacy and scalability, can be activated without compromising safety. The proposal was initially discussed over 200 days ago, and Taproot's underlying code was merged into Bitcoin Core over 140 days ago. The proposal involves counting blocks towards a 90% threshold required to lock in taproot shortly after the release of software containing this proposed activation logic. If the lock-in threshold is not reached within approximately three months, the activation attempt fails. However, if the lock-in threshold is reached, taproot is guaranteed to eventually activate, but not until approximately six months after signal tracking started. Speedy Trial uses BIP9 or its proposed BIP8 patchset, with BIP9 being preferred as it is already part of Bitcoin Core. False signaling is possible with any other proposal and the same problems can occur if miners fail to upgrade for any mandatory activation. However, unlike other proposals, false signaling may be encouraged due to the short timeline.The proposal aims to generate fast progress and end the debate surrounding Taproot activation schemes, while also giving actual data upon which to base future proposals. If successful, Speedy Trial would give up to six months advanced notice of Taproot activation, allowing users, developers, and organizations to prepare software, announcements, and celebrations for that event. However, there are concerns about the risk of chain splits and false signaling, which could result in significant financial losses for unprepared miners and users. Russell O'Connor has offered to work on a patch against BIP8 implementing it if it appears Speedy Trial may have traction. Matt Corallo expressed doubts about the proposed activation mechanism and suggested reducing signaling windows involved and starting them slightly later to ensure success remains likely.Bitcoin Core users are encouraged to participate in the ongoing discussion and provide input towards the implementation of this proposal. Initial discussion about implementation may be found in the ##taproot-activation log.</p>
