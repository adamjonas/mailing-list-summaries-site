    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate over LOT=true continues in the bitcoin-dev community, with some members opposing the idea of forced signaling while others support it as a means of ensuring activation. The crux of the issue lies in balancing two important principles: allowing miners to operate on their agreed contract versus protecting against protocol sclerosis for the project as a whole. The question also raises the issue of whether miners have a higher obligation to evaluate upgrades than economic nodes implementing cold storage and infrequent spends. While this obligation has been implicit thus far, LOT=true would make it explicit. Ultimately, this debate highlights the challenges inherent in navigating Bitcoin's complex and ever-evolving future.</p>
