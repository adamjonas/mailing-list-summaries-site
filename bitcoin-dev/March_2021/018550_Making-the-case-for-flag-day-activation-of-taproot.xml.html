    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Russell O'Connor expressed his support for almost any proposed taproot activation method, including a flag day activation. However, he believes that it is too early to dismiss BIP8 as an option. He thinks that starting with BIP8 LOT=false is generally considered a reasonably safe activation method and will be viewed as "not wholly unacceptable" by the majority of the community.O'Connor acknowledges the concern about divergent consensus rules on the network and suggests that after a normal and successful Core update with LOT=false, there will be more data showing broad community support for the taproot upgrade. However, he also thinks that a flag day activation could be the faster option if there is enough support.Regarding the timeline, O'Connor proposes that in the next release, Core could confidently deploy a BIP8 LOT=true client, which would help mitigate some of the concerns with LOT=false but still provide time for the community to take objective actions in support of taproot. He suggests that they can start the process of deploying LOT=false without agreeing on a second deployment of LOT=true after six months. The later deployment will most likely be moot, and they will have six months to spend debating the LOT=true deployment versus doing a flag day activation or something else.In summary, O'Connor supports almost any proposed taproot activation method, including a flag day activation, but argues that it is premature to dismiss BIP8 as an option. He suggests a timeline where Core deploys a BIP8 LOT=true client in the next release, while also starting the process of deploying LOT=false.</p>
