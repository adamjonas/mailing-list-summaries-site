        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The activation mechanism for Taproot (BIP 8) has achieved overwhelming consensus, except for one parameter - lockinontimeout (LOT). Some are advocating for a community release implementing LOT=true in a similar spirit to the 2017 UASF effort, as approximately 90% of mining pools have declared support. However, others argue that a social movement would require tremendous work to convince users, miners, and service providers to run a UASF client. The choice has always been about the order, with some thinking LOT=true should be attempted first and others thinking LOT=false should be attempted first.In a Bitcoin-dev conversation between Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces and Luke Dashjr, the former suggested that LOT=false activation method is better than LOT=true. Dashjr corrected him by saying that miners enforcing rules without social support is not a soft fork but a 51% attack. Ariel responded by stating that he never said LOT=true does it; rather, it must achieve 51% miner support to pose reorg risks to force apathetic users into paying attention. Dashjr further explained that LOT=True doesn't cause such disruption unless miners choose to create an invalid chain, which they could do at any time with or without a softfork involved.The author urges people to try LOT=false first, as it can be achieved without the need for a social movement, only requiring the convincing of 95% of miners. Apathetic users will not notice any service disruption regardless of the success or failure of the activation. However, it is unclear whether Bitcoin Core will be able to release any activation code due to disagreement logjams. Social movements are hard to create, especially when the people you're trying to convince don't feel threatened.A user-activated soft fork (UASF) release may be required to implement LOT=true, as there is no Core release with activation code. Approximately 90% of mining pools have declared support, and a kick-off meeting for the UASF effort is scheduled. The future of Bitcoin's scalability and privacy depends on the users, and they are encouraged to attend and support the effort to activate Taproot.The term "51% attack" is commonly used to refer to a majority censor, but some argue that it should be reserved for stealing from someone using hash power. Referring to miners enforcing rules without social support as a 51% attack confuses the actual behavior.</p>
