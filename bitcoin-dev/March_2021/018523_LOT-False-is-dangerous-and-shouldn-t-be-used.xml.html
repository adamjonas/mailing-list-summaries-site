    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the activation of Taproot continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal for LOT (LockinOnTimeout) has been suggested as a means to activate Taproot with reduced risk. With LOT=false, Taproot will be activated if at least 95% of miners vote yes, and with LOT=true, Taproot will be activated if at least 0% of miners vote yes. The idea of a middle-of-the-road solution with LOT=maybe has also been proposed. However, concerns have been raised about LOT=false resulting in a chain split and unreliable network for users who do not enforce Taproot rules. It has been argued that this assumption is absurd and that avoiding a reorg is trivially achieved through various means. The overall risk is claimed to be maximally reduced by LOT=true being the only deployed parameter, but LOT=false is already the default behavior of existing node software.</p>
