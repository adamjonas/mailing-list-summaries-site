        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange between Wladimir and Alan, the concept of transaction meta-data fields is discussed. Alan proposes adding separate strings for labeling addresses and transactions in the client. He believes that having different strings for owner information and purchase information would be ideal and would align with the availability of "label=" and "message=" fields in BIP 21. However, Alan acknowledges that this approach may not be feasible if Bitcoin-Qt cannot support it. For now, he suggests that users rely on the /label/ field for important information, as anything in the /message/ field might not be saved. Although Alan expects message data to be displayed after clicking the URI, it may not be saved. In the future, users may populate both the /message/ and /label/ fields with extensive data using newlines. The first line would serve as a summary and be displayed in the address book and ledger, while additional lines would be visible when the user opens a details window. This functionality would be automatically generated by the merchant, providing purchasers with detailed documentation effortlessly.Alan Reiner raises questions about the implementation of "label" and "message" fields in Bitcoin Wallet for Android. The response indicates that the current version ignores both fields, but displaying the transaction message is part of the developer's short-term plan. No distinction between the two fields is mentioned.During another email exchange, Alan inquires about the status and plans for supporting "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client. It is mentioned that the feature is already implemented for Linux (Gnome) and Windows but temporarily disabled on Windows due to a startup crash issue with boost::ipc. Alan also seeks clarification on the intentions behind the "label=" and "message=" fields. The label is intended for the destination address, while the message is meant for a freeform description of the transaction. Currently, the message is not stored in the Satoshi client, but there are plans to add it in the future, along with other transaction meta-data fields such as contact information, purchased items, and item prices.The author of the message requests information on two BIP 21 (URI scheme) implementation topics in Armory and Bitcoin-Qt. Firstly, they ask about the support for "bitcoin:" URIs in the Satoshi client and express that this feature could greatly enhance usability. Secondly, they seek clarification on the intentions behind the "label=" and "message=" fields in Bitcoin-Qt, highlighting how Armory has implemented them to support both address labels and transaction labels. The author suggests that merchants could include additional purchase information in the "message" field while only disclosing their business name in the "label" field to maintain privacy.</p>
