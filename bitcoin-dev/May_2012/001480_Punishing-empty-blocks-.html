    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on May 24, 2012, Jeff Garzik asked which miners were considered lazy, meaning those who had not produced a block in over 120 seconds. However, he cautioned that it was important to understand their motivations before taking any action. If the blocks were empty because some miners wanted to increase fees or fight against the increasing blockchain size, then there was not much that could be done. In the case of botnets producing empty blocks to avoid central pooling and load victims less, a solution like the one proposed in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68396.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68396.0</a> was recommended. For empty blocks produced by people who believed they gained a mining advantage by excluding transactions, education was needed, as dropping their blocks would not be effective, with some miners going a month with all their blocks being orphaned.</p>
