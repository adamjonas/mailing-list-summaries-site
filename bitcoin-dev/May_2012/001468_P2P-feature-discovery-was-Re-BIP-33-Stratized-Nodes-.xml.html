    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on May 16, 2012, Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr debated the idea of passing a huge list of nodes along as part of the address. Luke-Jr suggested that service bits are propagated as part of the address, making it easier to identify which nodes you want to connect to for special services. However, Jeff Garzik argued that if the peer list becomes too stratified, it could be a hint for clients to use another network entirely instead of overloading bitcoin's P2P network for unrelated tasks. Additionally, Jeff Garzik believed that passing a large list of nodes might not be practical in some situations. In response, Luke-Jr clarified that he meant the inverse, stating that if only a small minority of nodes are stratified, clients need a way to figure out which ones to connect to without connecting to every node.</p>
