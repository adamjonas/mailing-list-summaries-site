    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin.org is a website that serves as a resource for those interested in learning more about Bitcoin. It is currently unclear how best to run the page, but it is clear that one is needed. The ideal path would likely involve having some descriptions that aim to be neutral. Bitcoin-Qt is an application that acts as a peer-to-peer client and builds the backbone of the Bitcoin network. However, all implementations of Bitcoin do this subject to their feature set. Bitcoin-Qt is suited for enthusiasts, merchants, miners, developers, and anyone who wants to help support the project. Those who run Bitcoin-Qt are considered first-class network citizens and have high levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, this also depends on the user's feature set and usage model.MultiBit is another implementation of Bitcoin that is fast and easy to use, even for people with no technical knowledge. The site claims to have the backing specifics to this claim. Armory was partly funded by a community donation drive which raised over $4000. Each lib/client will have a donation thing on its own site, as well as the developer's real-world wallet.Electrum is another implementation of Bitcoin, but the privacy level is said to be lower than other clients. However, this ultimately depends on the user's usage, such as running their remote or using anonymizers. It is debated whether Bitcoin.org is independent since it must accept all lib/client under its umbrella and has a lib/client project of its own to remain so.</p>
