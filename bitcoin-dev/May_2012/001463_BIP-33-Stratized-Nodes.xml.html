    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concept of stratized nodes has been deemed cool and useful, but concerns have been raised regarding security and use cases beyond a sample conversation. The discovery process for stratized nodes occurs in the same way as normal nodes, with service nodes being explicitly chosen similar to IRC servers for clients. There are no economic motivations for running a stratized server, as is the case with BitTorrent super-nodes, Tor relays, or email servers. In terms of requests, it is suggested that keeping each request minimal would prevent resource starvation and simplify the protocol, while allowing history to be resolved with multiple services during data download and sorting.</p>
