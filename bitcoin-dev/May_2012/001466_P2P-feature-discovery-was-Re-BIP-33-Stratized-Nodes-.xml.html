    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message from May 16, 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed an alternative to further overloading service bits in the version message or altering it. Instead, he suggested making feature discovery an easy, flexible, and extensible process. His solution was to create a new command called "get-features" that returns a list of key/value pairs. The key is a string, and the value type is determined by the key.However, this solution assumes that one already has a connection to the peer in question. Service bits are propagated as part of the address, so one can see at a glance which nodes to connect to for some special service. Passing a huge list along may be unwieldy, though it makes sense for protocol changes that don't add new services.</p>
