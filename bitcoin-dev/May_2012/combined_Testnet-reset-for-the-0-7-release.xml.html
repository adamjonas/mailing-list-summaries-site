        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The 0.7 release of a new testnet called "Mark III" is now available on the master GitHub branch. The reset was necessary to create a more stable test network with blockchain rule changes such as BIP16 and BIP30, and testnet difficulty changes. The old testnet had issues due to old clients serving up different, incompatible chains but it did uncover some large-block-chain-reorganization bugs. The minimum difficulty for the new testnet is now 1.0, same as the main net, with a max-difficulty-protection rule that allows blocks to be mined at minimum difficulty under certain conditions.To make it easier to run both old and new code, the wallet and blockchain are stored in $DATADIR/testnet3 instead of $DATADIR/testnet. Additionally, the IRC channel for bootstrapping is now #bitcoinTEST3 instead of #bitcoinTEST. The Mark III testnet has a new blockchain that contains interesting test cases for BIP16, enabled Script opcodes, and block acceptance rules. Re-implementing Bitcoin and accepting the Mark III testnet blockchain is a good first test for compatibility.However, additional work is still required to ensure rejection of the same set of invalid transactions or blocks as the original Bitcoin code.</p>
