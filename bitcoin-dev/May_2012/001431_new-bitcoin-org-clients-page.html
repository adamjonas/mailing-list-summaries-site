    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses a proposed change to the Bitcoin.org clients page in order to improve user experience for new Bitcoin users. The idea is to sort clients by "ease of use" and default Armory to a standard user mode that is easy to use. The advanced features will still be available but not prominently displayed. The page should have a message like "New to Bitcoin? Start experiencing Bitcoin with My Phone, or My Desktop." The top three options on each page should be highlighted with a button for more options or a short list of other options without screenshots. Ideally, the page would be sorted by popularity, but since there are no good stats on that, the sorting can be done by how easy it is for users to get started. The disagreements can be settled by semi-regular rotation. Ordering is not super important and disagreements can be settled by rotating the options.</p>
