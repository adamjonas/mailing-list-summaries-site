    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and Andreas Schildbach on 5th March 2012, Andreas suggested adding Bitcoin Wallet to a list of cell phone apps. In response, Jorge raised concerns about the slowness of the app, but didn't have much experience with it as he was using an old phone. Andreas replied that while initially updating its blockchain takes around an hour on good WLAN, afterwards, Bitcoin Wallet works just as fast as any other client. The advantage of this approach is that users are not dependent on any server, as they are carrying the blockchain in their pocket.</p>
