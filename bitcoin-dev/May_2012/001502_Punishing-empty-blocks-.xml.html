    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of having a flag option for Bitcoin to punish blocks that do not include transactions. The current options seem to be pro-miner, such as restricting the relaying of free transactions. Therefore, including an option to restrict relaying of blocks from "stingy" miners could balance the bias and make the default client run as much pro-miner as pro-non-miner. A user suggests a fork where one benefits miners and one benefits non-miners, so people can vote based on the client they use. The current main client seems to be pro-miner and not necessarily what most people would choose if given an easier choice.</p>
