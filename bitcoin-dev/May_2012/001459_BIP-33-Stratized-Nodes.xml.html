    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal being presented involves the use of the existing Bitcoin protocol to provide a new functionality while maintaining compatibility. The proposal is outlined in detail on the Bitcoin wiki page for BIP 0033, which lays out the specific technical specifications and steps necessary to implement the proposed changes. It is important to note that this proposal does not affect current Bitcoin clients, meaning that users who do not wish to use the new parallel system can continue to operate as they have been. However, the proposed changes do allow for the parallel system to operate alongside and sometimes intersect with the main Bitcoin network in a positive way. Overall, the proposal seeks to enhance the capabilities of the Bitcoin network without disrupting its current infrastructure or user base. By utilizing the existing protocol and maintaining compatibility, the proposal aims to create a smooth transition into the new parallel system while also providing benefits to both new and existing users.</p>
