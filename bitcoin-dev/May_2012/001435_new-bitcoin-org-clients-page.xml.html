    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread contains a discussion on the ordering of Bitcoin clients. Gary Rowe proposes to keep it simple by listing client features and relevant information. Amir Taaki compares the conversation to annoying group emails and asks for guidance on how to make "reply all" the default in Mutt and exclude himself from group replies. Jeff Garzik provides an article about Reply-To Munging Considered Harmful. The email also includes details about Bitcoin clients such as Bitcoin-Qt, MultiBit, Armory, Electrum, and Bitcoin Wallet. Gary Rowe provides the features and relevant information for each client, including their required blockchain size, standalone or dependent client status, design purpose, available platforms, programming language used, and website link. He suggests ordering with Bitcoin-Qt first so that nobody can exploit the system. The Bikeshed Anti-Pattern problem is mentioned, which refers to people discussing irrelevant details instead of focusing on the main issue. Gary Rowe plans to merge the branch if there are no objections since the forum thread is becoming messy and this conversation could continue forever.</p>
