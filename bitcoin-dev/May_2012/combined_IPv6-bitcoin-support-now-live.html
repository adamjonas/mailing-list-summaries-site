        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 12, 2012, sipa added IPv6 support to the bitcoin/bitcoin.git repository, allowing for the integration of IPv6 nodes into the Bitcoin network. Pieter Wuille's DNS seeder at seed.bitcoin.sipa.be has also been updated to crawl the IPv6 network and provide AAAA records to assist IPv6 nodes in finding each other. Peter Todd noted that previously, an IPv6-only node would not be able to sync with the network unless a dual-net node was manually created and added. However, with the recent update, IPv6 nodes can now start up and sync with the network without any additional steps. In fact, Todd reported having five peers when he last checked.Jeff Garzik, representing exMULTI Inc., announced on the same day that IPv6 support had been added to the bitcoin/bitcoin.git repository. He mentioned that there were already a few live IPv6 nodes on the network and encouraged users with IPv6 connectivity to test the latest version of Bitcoin. Garzik also highlighted the role of Pieter's DNS seeder, which now includes crawling the IPv6 network and providing corresponding AAAA records. This feature is expected to facilitate the connection between IPv6 nodes.In summary, the recent update to the bitcoin/bitcoin.git repository introduced IPv6 support, allowing for the inclusion of IPv6 nodes in the Bitcoin network. Users are encouraged to update their software and test the new version, particularly those with IPv6 connectivity. Pieter's DNS seeder plays a crucial role in assisting IPv6 nodes in finding each other by providing AAAA records. The announcement was made by Jeff Garzik, representing exMULTI Inc., through a mailing list message. For users without IPv6, the resource sixxs.net is recommended as a means to obtain it.</p>
