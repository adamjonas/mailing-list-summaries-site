    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has revised the BIP 22 draft and is requesting further review. The revision addresses Geir's last email in March and practical problems faced by some pools recently. Changes from the last revision include renaming submitblock(, ) method to getmemorypool, using getmemorypool() to provide client capabilities and other information to the server while requesting a job, and longpolls using a parameter in the getmemorypool request instead of a separate URI. Additionally, the client can inform the server of its own size and sigop requirements in advance and request detailed transaction data from the server to manipulate transactions included in the final block without discarding fees or making the block invalid due to not having enough. With both client and server support, blocks can be proposed before wasting time mining them to ensure they are otherwise valid. Finally, servers can be arranged into single logical services with failover and load balancing, similar to the getwork X-Host-List and X-Switch-To extensions.
