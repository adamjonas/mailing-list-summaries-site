    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Peter Vessenes and Luke-Jr discuss various aspects of Bitcoin mining. Vessenes argues that anything hard to implement will not be implemented by miners and suggests that keeping things as easy as possible for potential participants is essential. Luke-Jr responds with his coinbaser branch proposal, which modifies the coinbase. They also discuss the possibility of using a 20 byte keyhash instead of a full URL in the coinbase, which would allow the owner to broadcast a full URI out-of-band. They further discuss the protocol for implementing the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for miners, including the use of http or https, redirecting URLs, and content-type. While Vessenes recommends using JSON for its extensibility, Luke-Jr argues that everything in the Bitcoin protocol requires a computer's interpretation for humans, and there is no reason to stray from this default. Finally, they agree that the coinbase advertisement must be part of every coinbase mined by the miner to prove which blocks are theirs.</p>
