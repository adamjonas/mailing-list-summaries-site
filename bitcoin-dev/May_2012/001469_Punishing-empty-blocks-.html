    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>mined is less than some threshold (e.g. 5 seconds). - If a miner mines an empty block, do not broadcast it to the network unless time since last block mined is greater than some threshold (e.g. 30 seconds).This change would disincentivize miners from mining empty blocks and encourage them to include transactions in their blocks instead. The proposed implementation would ensure that empty blocks are not stored or relayed if they are mined too frequently. Additionally, miners who mine empty blocks would not be able to broadcast them to the network immediately, but would have to wait for a certain period of time before doing so.Despite Satoshi's observation about hashing only the header, some miners still find it easier to mine empty blocks rather than waiting for new transactions. This practice has been observed to be common among some mining pools, raising concerns about the efficiency of the Bitcoin network.The proposed client implementation change aims to address this issue by making it less profitable for miners to mine empty blocks. By incentivizing miners to include transactions in their blocks, the change would increase the efficiency of the network and improve the user experience for Bitcoin users.Overall, the proposed implementation seems to be a reasonable solution to the problem of empty block mining. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be widely adopted by the Bitcoin community and implemented in future versions of the Bitcoin client.</p>
