        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jeff Garzik, in a message dated May 24, 2012, informed the Bitcoin community about some non-trivial mining power being devoted to mining empty blocks. In the last 2016 blocks, only 1.73% of them contained one transaction, which could be expected just from timing alone. Furthermore, Eligius appears to mine a fair number of these blocks through clever pre-computation of the hash tree for faster distribution right after new blocks. Jeff suggested that resources expended on fancy techno-economic hacks to discourage miners from mining empty blocks would probably be better spent writing very fast transaction tree generating code. In another message on the same day, Jeff requested to identify which miners were "lazy" (more than 120 seconds since last block). He emphasized that understanding the motivations behind empty blocks is important before taking any action. If empty blocks are mined to drive up fees or fight against the increasing blockchain size, there isn't much that can be done. However, if they are mined by botnets which don't have a local copy of the chain to load their victims less and avoid central pooling, then something like <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68396.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68396.0</a> could be helpful. Lastly, if empty blocks are produced by people who believe they gain a mining speed advantage by not including transactions, education would be more effective as dropping their blocks won't help much since miners have gone a month with 100% of their blocks being orphaned.</p>
