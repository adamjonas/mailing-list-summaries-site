    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Vessenes and Luke-Jr, they discussed the implementation of a solution for a potential DDoS problem in the bitcoin network. Vessenes suggested a "lighter" solution that would be less technically demanding, while Luke-Jr proposed a more secure and complex solution involving extra linkages between codebases. Vessenes argued that adding requirements to the protocol or codebase would add significant cost to the network over the next 10 years. Luke-Jr explained how his proposal could work by adding a new message to the p2p relay network that allows miners to publish/update their policy URI signed by the key in question. Counter-DDoS rules could decline to relay or store URIs for keys that haven't been published in - or achieved statistical significance in - the last N blocks.</p>
