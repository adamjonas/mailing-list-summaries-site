    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 25, 2012, a conversation took place between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr regarding the high occurrence of no-transaction (no-TX) blocks in Bitcoin mining. Luke-Jr stated that based on past statistics for Eligius's 100 blocks, it seems reasonable that 10% of one-transaction (1-txn) blocks would occur. He also mentioned that these 1-txn blocks are not necessarily harming Bitcoin intentionally. Luke-Jr then asked if anyone could figure out the math for how fast miners need to process transactions to reduce the number of 1-txn blocks. Jeff Garzik replied by suggesting to look at the time since the last block and correlate it with the number of non-spam transactions in the memory pool to determine which ones are quick blocks and which ones are lazy miners (>120 seconds since the last block). However, Luke-Jr argued that block times are not accurate enough for this method.</p>
