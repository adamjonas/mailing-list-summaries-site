    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik, in an email dated May 24, 2012, addressed the issue of mining empty blocks. According to him, there seems to be a significant amount of mining power devoted to mining empty blocks. As per his calculation, in the last 2016 blocks, only 35 had one transaction which is approximately 1.73% and could be attributed to timing alone. Additionally, Jeff noted that some blocks were mined by Eligius, a mining pool, which uses pre-computation of the hash tree for faster distribution after new blocks. He also suggested that instead of spending resources on fancy and potentially risky techno-economic solutions to discourage empty blocks, efforts should be made to write very fast transaction tree generating code.In conclusion, Jeffâ€™s email raises concerns about the amount of mining power being spent on empty blocks and suggests that instead of investing in complex solutions, more focus should be given to improving the transaction tree generating code.</p>
