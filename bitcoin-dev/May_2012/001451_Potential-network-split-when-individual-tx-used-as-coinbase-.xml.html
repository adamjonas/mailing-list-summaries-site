    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>From the given context, it seems that there was a change in the code of Bitcoin eight months ago that allows denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on 100 nodes sending transactions that use individual transactions as the coinbase. The writer is questioning whether this means that transactions with zero confirmations are at risk of causing a network split. They also mention having read about services that allow zero-confirmation transactions, suggesting that there are peers that accept them. It is unclear whether the writer has misread the code or not. They also ask if a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) would have been applicable for the change made to the code.</p>
