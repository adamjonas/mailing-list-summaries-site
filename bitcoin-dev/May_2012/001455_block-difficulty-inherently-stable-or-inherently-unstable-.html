    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author ponders over the way block difficulty is calculated and how it affects miners' decision to mine or not. They suggest that when the difficulty level is low, many miners might decide to mine, resulting in blocks being produced every 3 to 5 minutes. However, as the difficulty increases, it may no longer be cost-effective for miners to continue mining, leading to a drop in block production. The author questions whether the stability of Bitcoin so far has been due to miners not factoring in immediate cost-effectiveness or mining by zombie-farms. Overall, the author raises an interesting point about the impact of block difficulty on mining behavior and its potential effect on the Bitcoin network's stability.</p>
