    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Freicoin forum, Andreas Schildbach suggested adding Bitcoin Wallet to the list of smartphone clients. Jorge Timón responded to this suggestion by stating that someone had told him that the cell phone apps they had tried were still too slow. Schildbach explained that while it takes about an hour to update its blockchain initially on good WLAN, after that, Bitcoin Wallet is just as fast as any other client. He added that the advantage of this approach is that you are not dependent on any server. Essentially you're carrying the blockchain in your pocket. The discussion then shifts back to including some smartphone clients in the list.</p>
