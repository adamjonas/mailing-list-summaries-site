    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from May 2012 between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr, the issue of Bitcoin miners' freedom to reject transactions was discussed. Luke-Jr expressed concerns that miners were being restricted in their ability to reject transactions based on fees or spam filters, which he argued went against the design of Bitcoin. He also noted that this could punish miners who had implemented superior transaction spam filtering, as filter rules must be kept private and therefore cannot be disclosed to validating clients. However, Jeff Garzik disagreed with these assertions, stating that there was no evidence to support them and that network users have the right to veto garbage transactions generated by miners. Additionally, he disputed Luke-Jr's claim that 99% of the network runs a single client, pointing out that most nodes run a wide variety of rules and versions. Finally, Garzik argued that if legitimate miners did not adopt counter-rules to bypass new restrictions, illegitimate miners would end up with an even larger percentage of blocks found.</p>
