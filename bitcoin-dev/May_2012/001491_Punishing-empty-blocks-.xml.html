    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of being able to know what fees to expect from different miners and how clients can have a more distributed discovery mechanism for that information. One suggestion is that miners could include a pointer to a webpage or their minimum fee in the coinbase, which could be encoded properly, like the "/P2SH/" string for BIP0016. Clients could look up themselves or sites could accumulate this information from the chain itself. The format of the sla.php page should also be specified - but it could be a json-rpc call returning a json object like (as result): {sla_version: "0.1", accept_no_fee_tx: false, min_fee: 50000, big_tx_fee: 10000, extra fee pr kb}. It was suggested to create an open service whereby a miner could publish a short string in their conbase tying to the service and the service would have different metadata, including the miner's transaction guarantees. Peter had started a thread about this on bitcoin.org some time ago, and he offered to host such a service. It is observed that developers think that confirmations are too slow or that more blocks should include transactions. They suggest educating users about the relationship between confirmation speed and fees and raising the default transaction fee. If we interfere with the market tension between miners who don't include transactions and users who want their transactions included more quickly, all we'll accomplish is keep transaction fees below market level.</p>
