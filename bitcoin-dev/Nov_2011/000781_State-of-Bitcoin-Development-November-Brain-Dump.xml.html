    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The creator of Bitcoin, Gavin Andresen, has released a brain dump outlining issues that have been on his mind recently. He congratulated Wladimir for the new GUI release of 0.5 and expressed his opinion on the wallet encryption bug which he found embarrassing and stressful. Gavin wants to spend less time dealing with these bugs and more time working on technical issues. One solution is to find money to hire professional QA people to create test plans and execute them. He mentioned that there is a non-profit organization forming to handle Bitcoin PR and marketing. The BIP process (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) is working well, with good proposals and discussions. Gavin also listed high priority tasks he's not planning on working on which include implementing BIP14, reworking/rethinking wallet handling, and working on higher-level multi-signature/multi-device transaction approval. Instead, he would like to see more small code refactors that move non-performance-critical code from .h files to .cpp files, make classes more self-contained, etc. He also listed high priority tasks he's planning on working on which include creating a pull request for OP_EVAL/multisignature transactions, back-porting OP_EVAL/multisig to 0.3/0.4, working on the 'headers-only' branch, internal re-architecting, and cross-platform testing infrastructure tool. Overall, Gavin has a lot on his plate and hopes attendees of the upcoming conference in Prague will help answer the hard questions and report back.</p>
