    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Gavin Andresen explains about the issues with partially-signed transactions. He says that a transaction containing only one signature cannot be relayed across the network until it has enough signatures. Thus, it is not a valid transaction. He suggests that the transactions should be sent between clients using another protocol.Furthermore, Gavin talks about the formats and protocols for gathering signatures which are in the TODO category. Alan's BIP 10 is the next piece of the puzzle, and a standardized http/https RESTful API, or HTTP/JSON, or protocol buffers and raw sockets, or something built on top of that makes sense.Gavin also expresses his concerns about partially-signed transactions being on the main Bitcoin P2P network. He believes that there is no way to prevent someone from endlessly spamming bogus partial transactions just to be annoying. Therefore, he thinks that partially-signed transactions should not belong on the main Bitcoin P2P network.</p>
