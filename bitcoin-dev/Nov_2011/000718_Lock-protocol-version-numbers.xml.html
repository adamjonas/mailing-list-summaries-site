    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Amir Taaki suggested locking protocol version numbers and instead using the sub_version_num field and revision number for individual builds. He argued that different projects would have different release scheduling schemes and it would be too restrictive to lock them into the popular major.minor system. Instead, he suggested letting clients define the field however they wish while following the format of IDENTIFIER VERSION. Gavin Andresen supported this idea and suggested it would make a good BIP. Chris also seconded the use of sub_version_num as a client and version identifier. However, parsing the number from the string "Satoshi 0.5" would be required to find out the version number of other clients if it was needed, though there would be little reason for this with a sane protocol versioning scheme.</p>
