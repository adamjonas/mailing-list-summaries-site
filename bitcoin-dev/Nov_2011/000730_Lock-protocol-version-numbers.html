    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a conversation with Patrick Strateman, the idea was suggested that user-agent strings can be used as a starting point to create a hierarchy from protocol, variant, gui, flavour, and build. However, it was acknowledged that user-agent strings are not easy for parsing so some modifications will be needed. In BitcoinJ's case, the subver field is already set to its name and version. The question was raised on whether a freely defined comments field is necessary, which would allow for more specific information to be included in the string. Christian Decker mentioned that on BitDroid, he stopped updating the protocol version at 31700 and set the string to be both Version and Client, similar to BitcoinJ. It is important to note that this email exchange took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in November 2011.</p>
