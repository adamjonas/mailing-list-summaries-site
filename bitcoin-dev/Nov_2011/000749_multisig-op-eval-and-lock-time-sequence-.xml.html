    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BIP 0010 is being created to encourage a standard that developers would want to adopt from the outset. The aim is to offer an excellent solution before they even start asking questions, so there's a good chance people will use it. Fragmentation occurs when there are multiple competing ways to do something, each having some advantages the others don't have. However, BIP 0010 aims to solve a straightforward problem, and solutions that could compete against it are limited. People need a way to pass data around, and they want it to be as convenient to use and implement as possible. The creator of BIP 0010 believes that it is optimal as a building block for higher-level protocols. There may be ideas for why someone would want to create a competing idea to BIP 0010, but any such ideas could just be added to BIP 0010. This would reset the question of why anyone would need a competing idea. One concern raised by Michael Gr√∏nager is that introducing other protocols may never become a standard. A great number of clients will emerge, and this would be a thing to compete on. If BIP 0010 is part of the p2p network, it will be a seamless standard and easy for everyone to use, even across different clients.</p>
