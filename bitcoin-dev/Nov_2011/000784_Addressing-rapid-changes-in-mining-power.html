    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on November 23, 2011, Andy Parkins proposed abandoning the idea of a target difficulty for blockchain nodes. Instead, each node would generate the most difficult block it can while simultaneously listening for "the most difficult block generated before time T." The value of T would be based on the block generation rate of 10 minutes.However, there was a concern that miners could attempt to obtain more difficulty out of time and cheat their reported datetime (T). This issue was raised by Jorge Timón during the discussion.It is not clear whether this proposal was implemented or if any modifications were made to address the potential cheating issue. Nonetheless, the discussion highlights the ongoing efforts to improve the functionality and security of blockchain technology.</p>
