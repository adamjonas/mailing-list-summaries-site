        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed a solution to the timejacking problem which could prevent an attacker from introducing a time lapse in between the 2015-block windows. The idea was to keep all network rules as they are now, but change the timestamp value of multiple-of-2016 blocks to be set equal to the highest timestamp that occurred in the previous 11 blocks, instead of the current time. This would obey the previous rules and prevent a timejacking attack. When enough miners have upgraded their software, this new rule will become mandatory causing a chain split for those using old software. Pieter Wuille suggested allowing a short interval (1 minute or 10 minutes) instead of a fixed value for the multiple-of-2016 blocks, which Luke-Jr reminded him was already allowed for blocks in general. There were concerns about the proposed solution. One was that it prevented X-Roll-Time for miners. Another was that if only a small percentage of mining power adopted the scheme, everyone who did so would harm themselves by increasing the odds that the next block they mined would become invalid. Aidan Thornton suggested delaying the forwarding of these blocks and blocks that extend them until extended one more time. However, Alex Waters suggested bundling this and potential future blockchain-splitting changes to implement them in a major release down the road or save them for when they are very necessary. But Pieter Wuille opposed doing too much at once in this kind of change. General network health and user security require periodic upgrades. The whole notion that old versions will stop working would be a pretty good thing at this point in Bitcoin's existence.</p>
