    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a post on the Bitcointalk forum has admitted to still having some of their private keys in plaintext. They believe that BSDDB sometimes overwrites data by discarding a pointer to the old data and writing the replacement to a new location within the file. As a result, simply examining the file with a BSDDB library tool will not find this problem; instead, you must examine the raw binary file. The post includes instructions for verifying this problem, and the author has asked for someone to verify that it is indeed a real problem. They also suggest removing the post until a remediation plan is established.</p>
