    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Thiago reported a strange behavior while testing Bitcoin 0.5.0 on Linux. When he opened the qt-client, the blockchain stopped downloading at 10% and did not move to 11% even after waiting for 30 minutes. However, when he closed and reopened the qt-client, the blockchain started downloading again from 0%. He had an open firewall for the Bitcoin protocol. With his 0.4.0 client, he had no issues, and it worked fine with more than 30 connections on the same machine but another Linux user. On November 16, 2011, Gavin Andresen requested help sanity testing bitcoin-0.4.1 and bitcoin-0.5.0. He shared links to the test versions of these Bitcoin clients. The email also contained a sponsored message that Splunk takes IT infrastructure data and makes sense of it.</p>
