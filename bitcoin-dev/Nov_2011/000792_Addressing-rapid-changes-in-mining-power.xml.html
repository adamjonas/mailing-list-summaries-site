    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the timestamp system in mining blocks, Jorge Timón expressed concern that miners could cheat the system and increase their chances of mining a block by using false timestamps. He also asked where the network clock was located. However, Andy Parkins clarified that the probability of mining a block was now 100% in his system and that the probability of a miner's block being the hardest required actual hashing power regardless of the timestamp used. In response to Timón's query about the location of the network clock in the protocol, Parkins referred to util.cpp:GetAdjustedTime() in the satoshi client but noted that it was not part of the protocol and could be rewritten by a miner. Furthermore, he was skeptical that it was a perfect decentralized clock.</p>
