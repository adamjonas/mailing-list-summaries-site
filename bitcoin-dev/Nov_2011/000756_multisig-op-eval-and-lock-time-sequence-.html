    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the purpose of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their implementations. Alan suggests that BIPs are meant for collaboration to come up with a good solution before implementing it in software, and that his proposal only addresses how unsigned transactions can be serialized and users can collect addresses. He clarifies that any system developers want to implement on top of it to exchange data is up to them. However, Mike Hearn disagrees with creating BIPs without any actual implementation behind them, stating that design discussions should take place on the mailing list. He also shares his thoughts on escrow transactions in BitCoinJ, suggesting that a correct escrow protocol requires leveraging existing DNS/EV-SSL infrastructure with a "sign this nonce" HTTP request. Hearn believes that designs with no corresponding implementation are likely to have problems and should not be discussed in BIPs. He proposes revisiting the topic once he can install some software on his laptop, server, and a friend's server, and do a three-way mediated transaction between them.</p>
