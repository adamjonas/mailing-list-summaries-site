    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matts latest code has been tested by Andreas and seems to work correctly. Andreas had to extend the client a bit to refresh the filter every 25k blocks because even with the extra flag, eventually the filter degrades into uselessness, but it did still improve the situation quite a bit.The code is unit tested, been reviewed several times, has an interoperable implementation that has also been tested by Andreas in a build of his smartphone app, and is going to ACK the current code and request that it be merged in to 0.8. Gavin is asked for his opinion on this.The next step after that would be profiling. It's a big performance improvement for SPV clients already, but not as much as anticipated. There is a suspicion that there's a simple bottleneck or missed optimization somewhere. But that can obviously come post-0.8.</p>
