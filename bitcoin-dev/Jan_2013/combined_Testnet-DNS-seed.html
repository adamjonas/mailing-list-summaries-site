        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation, Peter Todd discusses the contents of seed.txt, a dumpfile produced by bitcoin-seeder that contains information about non-banned IP addresses that have connected to Bitcoin. He mentions having a script prepared to combine data from multiple seed.txt files into a pnSeed[] array C source code and plans to add it to the repository.Todd and Jeff Garzik discuss the possibility of running a seed node on an Amazon EC2 micro instance. However, IPv4 is currently supported, but not IPv6, and there is no Tor setup yet. Todd intends to run the node indefinitely as it is relatively cheap at $7.5/month and offers to provide a machine image copy to others. They also talk about updating the pnSeed list, which is outdated. Todd suggests a scripted process to transform Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[], filtering it with SORB's dynamic IP list and adding an expiry time of one year for transparency and easy maintenance.They further discuss the dedicated Amazon EC2 micro instance, with Todd stating that he can set up IPv6 and Tor if there is demand. Garzik suggests having at least one more person contribute a testnet seed to the list and keeping IRC enabled. Todd notes that the pnSeed list is out of date and proposes transforming Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[] as an alternative. The duration of Todd's plan to run the instance is unknown but expects it to continue indefinitely if there is interest.The author has set up a testnet DNS seed using Pieter Wuille's bitcoin-seeder on an Amazon EC2 micro instance. Currently, only IPv4 is supported due to EC2's lack of IPv6 support, and Tor hasn't been set up yet, but the author can do so if there is demand. The next step is to create a new strTestNetDNSSeed in the Satoshi client and would prefer another person to contribute a testnet seed to the list. Enabling IRC is also recommended. Additionally, the author mentions that the pnSeed list is outdated and asks Pieter if he has written any start/stop/monitoring scripts for the seeder. The modifications made by the author can be found at git://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin-seeder.git in the "testnet" branch, with intentions to send a pull request after testing.</p>
