        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik, Todd suggests that people should be given the opportunity to test how their code handles attempts to spend the genesis block coinbase and other transactions made to the genesis block address on testnet. The reason behind this suggestion is the possibility that Satoshi still has the key and could cause such a situation himself. Garzik agrees with Todd's suggestion.Gavin Andresen states in a discussion about testnet3 genesis block that it is identical to the main network genesis block, except for a different timestamp and nonce. However, the coinbase of the testnet3 pays to the same public key as the main network, but he doesn't have the private key for it. He suggested that it would be a good idea to implement this change for testnet4 in the future.The author of the email requests Gavin, who may have the private key for testnet3's coinbase, to release it or fix the issue for the eventual testnet4. While the case can be tested on a private testnet, it would be beneficial if people were forced to test it against their will. This will enable them to test their code's ability to handle attempts to spend the genesis block coinbase and other transactions made to the genesis block address. The author believes that this testing scenario would be advantageous because there is a possibility that Satoshi still has the key and could cause such a situation himself.</p>
