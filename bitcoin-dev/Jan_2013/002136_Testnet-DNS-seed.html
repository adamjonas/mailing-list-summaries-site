    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd discussed the possibility of running a seed node on an Amazon EC2 micro instance. However, it currently only supports IPv4 as EC2 doesn't support IPv6, and there is no Tor setup yet. Todd plans to run the node indefinitely, given that it is relatively cheap to run at $7.5/month. He also mentioned he can provide a machine image copy easily to anyone else who wants it. They also talked about updating the pnSeed list, which is out of date. Nanotube usually does the update, but a simple script that transforms Pieter's seeds.txt into pnSeed[] might be a nice alternative. Todd suggested that pnSeed could be filtered with SORB's dynamic IP list or similar, and additionally, add an expiry time of one year. By creating a scripted and repeatable process, it would make updating the list more transparent and easy to maintain.</p>
