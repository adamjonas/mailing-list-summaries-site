    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email from 2013, Mike Hearn provides an update on the progress of bitcoinj and bitcoin-qt work. He thanks Matt for his excellent work, saying that they are just a week away from having all the code in a mergeable state. Mike mentions that there are a couple of bugfixes needed on the bitcoinj side, with the first one being completed already. The default FP rate requested by BCJ needs to be adjusted to be 0.0001, which is appropriate for the latest blocks in the chain and yields 0-5 false positives per block. This is part of the larger API changes mentioned above. A new part to the filter protocol needs to be introduced that allows clients to control auto-expansion. The flags mentioned have been implemented, both to disable autoexpansion, enable it for all outputs, enable for only pay to pubkey outputs or use a set of templates. With auto-expansion disabled, the FP rate adjusted and a bugfix on the bcj side, Mike was able to sync a wallet using a bloom filtered chain. He believes that this work should go into 0.8, making it more compelling to advertise it this way. He also mentions that if they discover any showstopper problems, they just won't deploy the code that uses the new messages into clients.</p>
