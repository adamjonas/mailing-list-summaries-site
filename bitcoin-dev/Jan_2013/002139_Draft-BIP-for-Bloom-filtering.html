    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context provided is about the Bitcoin Wallet app's test builds that are available on Google code and not yet released on Play store. The new bloom filtering and peer selection codes have been uploaded in these builds which provide a cool performance gain. The app feels much faster to start up and sync. The next step after this is to optimize disk accesses as current bitcoinj is very inefficient in how it writes. The BIP is slightly stale, but only slightly. Matt Corallo's latest code has been tested by Andreas and seems to work correctly. He had to extend the client a bit to refresh the filter every 25k blocks because even with the extra flag, eventually, the filter degrades into uselessness, but it did still improve the situation quite a bit. Mike Hearn wants to request that the code be merged into 0.8. After that, the next step would be profiling. It's a big performance improvement for SPV clients already, but not as much as anticipated. There might be a simple bottleneck or missed optimization somewhere.</p>
