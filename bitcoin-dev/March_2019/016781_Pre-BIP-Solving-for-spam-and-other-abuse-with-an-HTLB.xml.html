    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alistair Mann, a contributor to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 118, received feedback from user ZmnSCPxj regarding the use of Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) and Hashed Time-Locked Bond (HTLB). ZmnSCPxj believes that HTLB over HTLC can improve anonymity by making it indistinguishable on-chain from other uses of HTLC. However, Alice would have to give the redundant one to Bob since using a standardized one would reveal the use of HTLB over HTLC. Another suggestion made by ZmnSCPxj was to apply the Funding Transaction pattern to improve privacy by keeping a script offline. While Mann welcomed the idea, he stated that it does not affect the suggested BIP, but it could improve the mainnet's use of scripts in the future.</p>
