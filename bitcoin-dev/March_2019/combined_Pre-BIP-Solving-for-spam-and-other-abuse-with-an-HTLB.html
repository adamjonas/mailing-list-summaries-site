        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal for a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called "Good Behaviour Bonds" has been discussed by Alistair Mann and ZmnSCPxj. The proposal involves the use of Hashed Time-Locked Bond (HTLB) over Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) to incentivize good behavior from both parties, with Alice committing funds in advance to a penalty that protects any addressable resource and non-addressable resources. It was suggested that using HTLB over HTLC is more efficient as the latter compels unused storage and unnecessary processing. ZmnSCPxj believes that HTLB over HTLC can improve anonymity by making it indistinguishable on-chain from other uses of HTLC. However, using the standardized one would reveal the use of HTLB over HTLC. Another suggestion made by ZmnSCPxj was to apply the Funding Transaction pattern to improve privacy by keeping a script offline.The Funding Transaction Pattern can be applied to further improve privacy, and it is applicable to all constructions that have a fixed participant set. While Mann welcomed the idea, he stated that it does not affect the suggested BIP, but it could improve the mainnet's use of scripts in the future. Furthermore, /u/almkglor suggests that Bob could immediately fail the HTLB to Alice's benefit, which could be done with a new script. Mann will modify the proof-of-concept code to investigate and prove this change.Lastly, the Hashed Time-Locked Bond (HTLB) is a potential minor change to the current system that incentivizes against spam and abuse, and it is suggested that the name for this new concept could be "Hashed Time-Locked Bond." Alistair Mann expresses gratitude to those who contributed, including the 60+ non-bot visitors to the berewic.com site, stating that quiet interest is positive. Assuming no other major changes, the next update will be a formal write-up for the BIP.</p>
