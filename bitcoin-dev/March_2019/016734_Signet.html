    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new network called "signet" has been created as a complement to the existing testnet. Unlike testnet, signet is completely centralized and blocks are signed by a specific key instead of using proof of work. This makes signet more predictable, stable, and easier to perform global testing. Anyone can create a signet at any time by creating a key pair and a challenge scriptPubKey. A persistent signet would be beneficial for services that need a stable place to test features over an extended period of time. Signets consist of two parameters: the challenge script (scriptPubKey) and the solution length. A default persistent "signet1" is proposed to be created, which can be replaced in future versions if necessary. This signet is picked by default if a user includes -signet without providing any of the mentioned parameters. The key holder would be someone trusted in the community who is willing to run the system. It could be made more sturdy by using 1-of-N multisig as the challenge, in case one key is compromised. Overall, the creation of signet provides benefits to those involved in Bitcoin protocol implementation and testing, allowing for more stable and predictable testing environments.</p>
