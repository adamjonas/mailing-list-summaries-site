    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Lord James Hrmh suggests that Bitcoin users should lock in a blockheight to get rid of it 10 years in the future and use it as press to show that Bitcoin would lose $1,000,000 if a mystery person does not put their transaction through by then. He encourages global presses to be involved in this plan. Lord James Hrmh says that this is an opportunity to get rid of it while it is still possible. Anything that is gazetted becomes public knowledge. In response to a proposal to remove OP_CODESEPARATOR from Bitcoin, Sjors Provoost argues that the vulnerability it presents outweighs any potential harm to existing users who may already have pre-signed lock-timed transactions. One proposed alternative is to increase the weight of transactions that execute OP_CODESEPARATOR, but this adds unnecessary complexity. Matt Corallo notes that OP_CODESEPARATOR is non-standard, so getting them mined is difficult in any case. A contextual check on transactions seems too painful to implement, and changing the way transaction weight is calculated to something akin to Ethereum's gas pricing is too complicated.</p>
