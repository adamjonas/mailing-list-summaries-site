    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The vulnerability of OP_CODESEPARATOR in its current form is a cause for concern and cannot be ignored for another 10 years. There have been efforts to remove the non-standard opcode, which represents a significant vulnerability in Bitcoin, but finding practical use-cases for its specific construction has proven unsuccessful. While some suggest limiting the number of OP_CODESEPARATORs allowed per script or increasing transaction weight upon execution, these solutions come with their own complications. It is argued that the highly-unlikely remote possibility of rendering an old transaction unspendable should not prevent fixing a current vulnerability. Suggestions for contextual checks on transactions have been proposed, but implementing them would require significant effort. Overall, addressing the vulnerability of OP_CODESEPARATOR is necessary despite the potential difficulties in finding a solution.</p>
