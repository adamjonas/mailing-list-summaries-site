    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a proposal to remove OP_CODESEPARATOR from Bitcoin, which some argue could be a potential vulnerability. The removal of OP_CODESEPARATOR is seen as violating the principle of not invalidating secure transactions. Some suggest alternative solutions such as increasing transaction weight or limiting the number of OP_CODESEPARATOR calls.Non-standardness is seen as a way to signal potential soft-forks and make them safer for miners to adopt. However, concerns are raised about potential harm to users who have committed funds to non-standard transactions. It is important to ensure that any changes do not destroy other people's money. The discussion highlights the importance of balancing security concerns with the principles of open access and backward compatibility that underlie Bitcoin's value proposition. This demonstrates the collaborative nature of the Bitcoin development community.The provided context is related to the Bitcoin development mailing list, which is a platform where developers can discuss and collaborate on Bitcoin-related projects. The mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation. Interested individuals can subscribe to the mailing list through the provided link.Finally, the email includes an HTML attachment that has been scrubbed, indicating that there was some issue with it. However, it is unclear what the attachment contained or why it was removed.</p>
