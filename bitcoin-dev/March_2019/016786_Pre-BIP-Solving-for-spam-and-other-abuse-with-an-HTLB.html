    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Alistair Mann and ZmnSCPxj discusses a BIP for "Good Behaviour Bonds". ZmnSCPxj suggests using HTLB over HTLC to improve privacy, but this requires the redundant and [HASHOP] not be standardized. The conversation then shifts to whether Bob could immediately fail the HTLB to Alice's benefit, with Alistair modifying his proof-of-concept code to investigate this change. However, this is at odds with the suggestion to transport HTLBs over HTLCs, which already has a standard template defined by BIP-199. ZmnSCPxj suggests an early return to Alice can be implemented by Bob without any input from her. The overall flow of messages is described, with Alice sending the preimage, [HASHOP], and a new address for "early return", making a transaction to the HTLC pattern. Bob has until the [HASHOP] timeout to decide whether to claim the money or return it to Alice, and if he hasn't decided by the timeout, Alice can get her money back.</p>
