    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Sjors Provoost and another individual on March 8th, 2019, the topic of transaction weight in Bitcoin was discussed. Currently, transaction weight only considers whether bytes are part of the witness and not OP codes. The idea of changing it to be more like Ethereum's gas pricing was deemed too complicated. However, it was suggested that counting the number of occurrences of OP_CODESEPARATOR (possibly at the same time as counting OP_CHECKSIG operations) would give a reasonable compromise for determining weight without execution. The proposed formula for increasing weight based on this count would ideally take OP_IF branches into account as well. The conversation also touched on the assumption that those who use OP_CODESEPARATOR would be reading the email exchange, with doubts about the validity of that assumption due to language barriers and lack of subscription to the mailing list.</p>
