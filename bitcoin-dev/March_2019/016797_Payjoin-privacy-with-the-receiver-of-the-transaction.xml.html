    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is centered around the idea of "pre-fragmenting" wallets to enhance privacy in Bitcoin transactions, specifically through payjoin. However, this approach may not be practical for everyday users due to cost-ineffectiveness. The conversation then shifts to the potential privacy leak that can occur when a user sends a payjoin payment from an address containing a larger amount than the intended transfer. A proposed solution involves automatically splitting the balance into multiple addresses with smaller amounts to avoid revealing the total balance to recipients. However, there are many different approaches to coin selection and utxo management, making it important for each individual user to consider their own needs when using their wallet.</p>
