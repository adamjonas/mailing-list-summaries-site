    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the privacy concerns with Payjoin for Bitcoin. The issue being that a sender or receiver of a transaction could get information about the bitcoin balance of each other, even if they were trying to use Payjoin for private transactions. The suggestion is to fix this by having an automatic splitting to itself in the background, possibly in $100 amounts. For users who want privacy, this shouldn't be a problem. However, it's unlikely to be practical for normal users, as it'll generally result in pretty big and cost-ineffective transactions. Nonetheless, small amount addresses combined with Payjoin can give real privacy to Bitcoin users. It is suggested that users who don't want privacy can disable the "Private" mode in the wallet and disable the auto-splitting feature. Overall, the discussion highlights the tradeoffs involved with coin selection, utxo management, and payjoin contributed input selection. Good solutions will be wildly different depending on how you use your wallet.</p>
