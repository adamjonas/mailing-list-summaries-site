    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core may remove the "reject" messages feature from its system, as it has been disabled by default since version 0.18.0. The feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has caused issues in the past, particularly with nodes on the network that cannot generally be trusted to send valid ("reject") messages. This has led developers to believe that the feature is no longer necessary and its removal would make the codebase slimmer, easier to understand and maintain. Developers have proposed alternative testing methods for those who rely on the feature, including inspecting log messages produced by a recent version of Bitcoin Core, using specific RPCs to test the validity of blocks and transactions, and relying on fee estimation to determine transaction fees and setting replace-by-fee if desired. The proposal to remove the feature from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 has been made unless there are valid concerns about its removal.</p>
