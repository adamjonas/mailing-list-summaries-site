        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Omar Shibli proposed a new method for conducting transactions using the Homomorphic Payment Addresses and Pay-to-Contract Protocol, which uses the homomorphic property of elliptic curve encryption to achieve payment. The proposal defines levels in BIP32 path and contract commitment address that is computed by hashing a document with a cryptographic hash function. However, Gregory Maxwell found this construction insecure, and raised concerns about the security of the construction and durability issues which were not addressed in the proposal.In response, Omar clarified the application of the construction, provided an example and updated the BIP to address Gregory's concerns. The team also developed a basic trade finance application to conduct transactions using the Homomorphic Payment Addresses and the Pay-to-Contract Protocol paper. They have generalized it and made it BIP43 complaint. The team defines levels in BIP32 path as m / purpose' / coin_type' / contract_id' / *. Contract_id is an arbitrary number within the valid range of indices. They define contract base as the following prefix: m / purpose' / coin_type' / contract_id'. Contract commitment address is computed by hashing a document with a cryptographic hash function of your choice (e.g. Blake2), mapping the hash to partial derivation path and computing child public key by chaining the derivation path from step 2 with contract base. Payment address funds could be reclaimed only if the customer_contract_signature is provided by the customer. In terms of durability, their app is pretty simple at this point, they don't store anything, they let customer download and manage the files.The email thread includes a message from Omar Shibli expressing his appreciation for Gregory Maxwell's work in the FOSS ecosystem, particularly in Bitcoin and Blockstream. He also submitted fixes to Gregory's concerns regarding a security fix patch in the CKD function (BIP32) and requested his review. In another email, Omar shared an updated draft of a BIP specifying the multiparty key derivation scheme for the pay-to-contract protocol and sought feedback. ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the possibility of an attacker finding two contracts whose derivations alias each other and the possibility of multiple contracting systems. Developers hope this proposal will result in a standard for the benefit of the community. Omar Shibli further expressed his opinion that the security fix was redundant.</p>
