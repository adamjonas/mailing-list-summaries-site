    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns is proposing the idea of tagged outputs, which he calls "taproot plus" that would allow for noinput signatures to be used along with normal taproot addresses. This would allow for more flexibility in transactions. The proposed structure would involve a funding transaction leading to either a cooperative claim or an update 3 [TAGGED] transaction leading to either a settlement 3 or a claim. Another option would be an update 4 [TAGGED,NOINPUT] transaction leading to a settlement 4 [TAGGED,NOINPUT] and then a claim [NOINPUT].However, there is a concern about how to bind update 3 to the funding tx output if it is not tagged. One solution proposed is to keep each update in multiple separate states, one bound to the funding tx output and another signed with noinput. However, this would double the storage and communication requirements. Another alternative is to add a trigger transaction that would need to be published in a unilateral case, but that would increase the on-chain footprint.</p>
