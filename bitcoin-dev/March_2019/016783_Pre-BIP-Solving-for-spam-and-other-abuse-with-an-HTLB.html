    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj suggests a Funding Transaction Pattern that improves privacy by keeping a script offline. He believes that it is important to use HTLB over HTLC to improve the anonymity set. It would be indistinguishable onchain from other uses of HTLC and would add to privacy. The redundant would have to be given by Alice to Bob, since using a standardized one will also reveal use of HTLB over HTLC instead of hiding it among other HTLC UTXOs. ZmnSCPxj believes that gmax created Taproot as an optimization of this pattern but is unsure if it has been named before. However, calling it "gmax technique" would be ambiguous as it could apply to many techniques. Alistair Mann welcomes the Funding Transaction Pattern and recognizes that it would improve mainnet use of scripts.</p>
