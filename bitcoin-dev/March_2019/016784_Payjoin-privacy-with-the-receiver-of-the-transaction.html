    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Payjoin is a possible solution for Bitcoin privacy, but there are concerns regarding privacy leaks. For instance, if a user has 1 BTC in a single address and makes a payjoin payment of 0.1 BTC to another person using that address as input, the recipient can see the change address with an amount of 0.9 BTC on a blockchain explorer. This poses a serious privacy issue. To resolve this concern, a standard solution may be implemented, such as a wallet check that ensures no address contains more than a "safe" amount of 0.01 BTC or less. If an address exceeds this amount, the wallet could automatically make one payment to itself to split the amount into several addresses. This way, the recipient of a payment from a user will not know that the user's bitcoin balance exceeds the "safe" amount.</p>
