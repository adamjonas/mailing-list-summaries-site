    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to switch to "satoshi" as a base unit for Bitcoin has been floated around, but it has met with criticism from some members of the Bitcoin community. The idea was presented on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by Amine Chakak, but one user argued that if Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had wanted the currency units named after him, he would have done so himself. Additionally, another user pointed out that the lightning network, which is built on top of Bitcoin, actually uses units of 10 picobitcoin rather than satoshis. As a result, the idea of creating a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for the switch to satoshi as a base unit was discouraged.</p>
