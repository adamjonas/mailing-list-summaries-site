    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoinj 0.15 now supports native segregated witness. The release of this update has been announced recently, as per a post on Google groups. In order to test the operability of the new version, Bitcoin Wallet's new versions 7.0 have also been released by the team. Although it creates a keychain of legacy addresses, it can send to native segwit addresses through Bech32. It is available on Testnet and Mainnet. However, for the latter, users need to opt into beta in order to receive 7.x. The team is working on the ability to receive and spend from native segwit addresses, which will be released in the next few days and weeks.</p>
