    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Payjoin protocol is meant to enable private transactions, but there is a concern that it could reveal the balance of the sender or receiver. To address this issue, an automatic splitting transaction could be added in the background when a wallet receives a high amount of bitcoin, such as $100 or more, to separate it into multiple addresses. This would allow for greater privacy when using Payjoin. However, this feature may not be practical for all users as it could result in larger and less cost-effective transactions. Ultimately, different coin selection and utxo management strategies may be needed depending on how a user chooses to use their wallet.</p>
