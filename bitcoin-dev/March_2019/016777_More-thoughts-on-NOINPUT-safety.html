    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list discussed the use of tagged outputs as "taproot plus" which could potentially allow for normal taproot address functionalities as well as noinput sigs. In a unilateral case, all update transactions need to be tagged in case they are spent by a later update with a NOINPUT sig. This would also require the settlement transaction to use a NOINPUT sig, and claiming/refunding HTLCs would need a partially-pre-signed tx that would also require a NOINPUT sig. However, this method may compromise privacy. In a cooperative case, output tagging is not needed. The discussion also touched on using scriptless scripts for HTLCs, which would require allowing for NOINPUT sigs when claiming funds.</p>
