    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Several individuals on the bitcoin-dev mailing list have proposed different solutions for removing OP_CODESEPARATOR, a non-standard script opcode that is considered to be a significant vulnerability in Bitcoin. One suggestion involves putting it in a deprecated state and adjusting the transaction weight so using the opcode becomes more expensive, while also widely publicizing its deprecation. Another proposal suggests locking in a blockheight to get rid of it 10 years in the future and making UTXOs containing OP_CODESEPARATOR (and others) mined prior to the soft fork activation standard, with weight penalties as appropriate, so there will be no difficulty spending them before the cutoff. One email suggested adding complexity to contextual checks for transactions, such as requiring only one input and being smaller than 400 vbytes, while another noted that OP_CODESEPARATOR is non-standard and therefore difficult to get mined in any case.</p>
