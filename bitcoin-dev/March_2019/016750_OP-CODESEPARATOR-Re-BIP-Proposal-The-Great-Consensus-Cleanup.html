    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of non-standardness in Bitcoin transactions and how it affects users. The purpose of non-standardness is to make soft-forking safer and signal the candidate for soft-forking. However, some users have expressed that they have been hurt by certain non-standardness changes and are unable to complain due to fear or futility. While non-standardness may dissuade users from committing new funds to OP_CODESEPARATOR scripts, it does not help those caught off guard by the change. An example cited is PR #5247, which makes unparsable public keys non-standard and has affected some users' funds for over four years. The lack of comments on this matter on the mailing list further supports the notion that users may not speak up even if their money is at risk.</p>
