    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 8, 2019, Matt Corallo suggested keeping the existing block header format and instead applying signature rules to a field in the coinbase transaction to make testing easier. Another suggestion was made to make the signature an optional addition to the header to allow for "light nodes" that don't verify signatures and full nodes that do. Signatures would sign the traditional 80-byte header and not be included in the block's tx merkle root. The previous hash would reflect the hash of the previous block's 80-byte header without the signature. A p2p service bit could be added to the header to indicate whether signatures should be sent or received. The p2p encoding of the header would change to include the signature. Header processing would ignore headers from nodes that don't have the service bit set. It was also suggested that including the previous block's header signature in the current block's coinbase should be enforced.</p>
