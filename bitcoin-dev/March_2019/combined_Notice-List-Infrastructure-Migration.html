        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Starting this week, Bitcoin-oriented lists such as bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev will begin migrating from <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo</a> to the Linux Foundation's new list infrastructure operated by groups.io. The exact switch-over date is unclear at the moment, but users are advised to unsubscribe prior to migration if they do not wish to be auto-subscribed to the new list management system. While each list is notified that migration is complete, users may continue to use these lists as-is. Archives are of utmost importance for prior art and historic value.In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Warren Togami Jr. announced that a new archive will be operated independently outside of the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. This move is aimed at ensuring that future archives will not have to move again even if the underlying list infrastructure changes. The new archive will include a search function and enable users to perform git clone for a local instance. Peter Todd, a contributor to the discussion, asked where the git archive would actually be created/maintained and suggested that it should be timestamped and PGP signed. In another message, a user requested more communication in advance with relaxed timelines for future migration phases.On March 18, 2019, Warren Togami Jr. announced on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that a new archive will be created independently outside of the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. The archive aims to provide a search function and git clone for a local instance. It is hoped that the archive will not need to move again even if the underlying list infrastructure changes. The location of the git archive is unclear but it could be timestamped by installing OpenTimestamps appropriately on the server maintaining it. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have the archive PGP signed.A plan is being worked out with the Linux Foundation sysadmins to ensure that the current archive permalinks remain static or redirected to the correct post that lives at a new archive. The new archive will be operated independently outside from the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. This will allow all future archives to stay in place even if the underlying list infrastructure needs to change. Users can benefit from the search function and git clone for a local instance. Further details will be posted soon.</p>
