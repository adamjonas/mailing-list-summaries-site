    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the replay attacks and their impact on BIP148 and BIP149. Kekcoin mentions that the replay threat would be irrelevant because there would be no other chain to replay the TX on, as the non-148 chain would have been reorganized into oblivion. In order to catch up and replace the large number of blocks added to the legacy chain, >51% is required for BIP148 to succeed, and likely >>51%. Without replay protection at the outset, BIP148 isn't a threat to miners. The difference between using "post-chainsplit coinbases from the non-148 chain" to unilaterally taint coins is more secure in extreme-adverserial cases such as secret-mining reorg attacks. The only large-scale (>100 block) reorganization the non-148 chain faces should be a resolution of the chainsplit and therefore render the replay threat moot. The email ends with a request to not send anything via email that the sender is not comfortable sharing with the NSA.</p>
