    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author believes that 80% of hashrate would need to be running BIP91 by June 30 to lock in by July 13 and activate by July 27, which is a tight timing but not impossible. However, if SegWit is locked in by August 1 with or without BIP91, no split will occur even if SegWit is not active yet and the hashrate majority could avoid the split that way. The last thing the author heard was that they will wait until "immediately" before signaling SW. There is still uncertainty why they will wait instead of starting to signal SW today. Another way to prevent the split is if BIP148 users abort BIP148 deployment, but this seems increasingly unlikely.</p>
