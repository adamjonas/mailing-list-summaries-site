    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ongoing debate over the activation of Segwit upgrade to the Bitcoin network has taken a new turn with the possibility of miners choosing between two options - BIP148 and Segwit2x. However, many miners are faking it by signaling Segwit2x while not signaling segwit, which is required. The technical community seems to be unanimously rejecting Segwit2x and its definition keeps changing without any specification. Mark Friedenbach warns that if miners interpret the situation as being forced to run non-reference software in order to prevent a chain split because of a lack of support from Bitcoin Core, it could lead to a one-way street. But Erik Aronesty believes that the chances of such a shift being temporary are high and likened the current situation to the previously debunked "XT" and "Classic" hysteria. All those things (148/91/segwit2x(per today)) effectively guarantee a chain split, so there is no option to prevent it.</p>
