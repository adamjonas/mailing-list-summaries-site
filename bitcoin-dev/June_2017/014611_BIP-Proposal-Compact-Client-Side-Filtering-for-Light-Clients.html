    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Monday, 19 June 2017 17:49:59 CEST Jonas Schnelli and bfd--- via bitcoin-dev debated whether filtering of unconfirmed transactions is necessary. Jonas believes that many users would trade higher privacy for not having the "incoming transaction" feature. If users want 0-conf, they can fetch all incoming transactions. However, Tom Zander corrected Jonas by explaining that the use case is not about zero-conf but rather to see what is happening while the transaction is broadcast on the network. When a transaction is meant for the wallet, the SPV wallet should parse and check the actual transaction. This is not just to see that something was actually sent, but also to be able to see how much is being paid and if the transaction is marked as RBF-able. Tom emphasized that providing information to users when possible is really basic usability.</p>
