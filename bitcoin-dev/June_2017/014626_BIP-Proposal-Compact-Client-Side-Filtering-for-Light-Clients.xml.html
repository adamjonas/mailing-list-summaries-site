    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Gregory Maxwell questioned the justification for the loss of privacy that comes with filtering. However, his figures were proven to be wrong and baseless, therefore, there was no need to debunk them. Tom Zander argued that stating a bloom filter is a loss of privacy is equally baseless, and although BIP37 already exists, improvements are always useful. He also criticized Maxwell's argument against a feature he doesn't like, which could stifle innovation.</p>
