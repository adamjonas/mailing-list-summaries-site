    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The COOP proposal aims to increase the block size in the Bitcoin network gradually over a period of 4 years, without causing any drastic changes in transaction fees. This proposal has been put forth by some members of the Bitcoin community who believe that increasing the block size is necessary for the network to handle more transactions efficiently. The proposal suggests increasing the block size limit by 16 times, which would result in 4MB blocks. According to the proposal, the increase in block size will be implemented gradually over the course of 4 years. This approach is expected to prevent any sudden spikes in transaction fees and ensure that the network can handle increased traffic without causing any disruption. The COOP proposal has received mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community, with some supporting it as a pragmatic solution to the network's scalability issues, while others are concerned about potential centralization and security risks associated with larger blocks.The debate around the block size has been ongoing for several years in the Bitcoin community, with different proposals being put forth to address the issue. The current block size limit is set at 1MB, which has been criticized for limiting the network's capacity and causing high transaction fees during periods of high demand. The COOP proposal is one of several solutions being considered to improve the network's scalability and efficiency.Overall, the COOP proposal suggests a gradual increase in the block size limit over a period of 4 years, resulting in 4MB blocks, which is expected to prevent any sudden fee spikes and ensure efficient handling of increased traffic on the Bitcoin network. However, there are concerns about potential centralization and security risks associated with larger blocks, and the proposal has received mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community.</p>
