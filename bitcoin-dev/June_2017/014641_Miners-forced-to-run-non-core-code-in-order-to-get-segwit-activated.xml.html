    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The activation period for the latest BIP91 implementation in Segwit2x has been reduced to 336 blocks, or 2.33 days, according to a post on Github. If 80% of hashpower runs the code and signals on bit 4 by July 25, then those 80% will start orphaning non-bit-1 blocks before August 1, allowing a split between Segwit2x and BIP141 to be avoided. There may still be some few non-bit-1 blocks that get orphaned after August 1 because they are mined by old BIP141 nodes. However, it seems like very few miners won't be signaling either Segwit2x or BIP141 by then. Meanwhile, Bitcoin developers have rejected Segwit2x and expressed concern about the risk of a chain split.</p>
