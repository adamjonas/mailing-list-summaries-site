    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is regarding the security concerns of using BIP148 and BIP149. The sender, Kekcoin, suggests that using "post-split coinbases from the legacy chain" as seedcoins for cointainting purposes is a safe approach to cointainting, as it would only be rendered redundant if there was a resolution of the coinsplit. The discussion then moves towards replay attacks and the threat they pose. The recipient, contact at taoeffect.com, raises concerns about the lack of replay protection and how it makes replay a serious threat. They suggest that since >51% is required for BIP148 to succeed, it might as well do as SegWit did originally, or lower the threshold to 80% or something (as BIP91 does). However, Kekcoin argues that the replay threat would be moot because there would be no alternative chain to replay the TX on, as the non-148 chain would have been reorganized into oblivion. The emails were sent with ProtonMail Secure Email.</p>
