    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The New York Agreement (NYA) text, which granted no authority for upgrading a proposal by Sergio Demian Lerner, still confuses its signatories who disagree on its meaning, according to an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Although 80% of miners have reportedly set "NYA" in their coinbase string, it is unclear whether this supports BIP-91 or the code in the btc1 repository. The NYA is also distinct from BIP-91, as it was written before BIP-91 existed and differs from its text in significant ways. Meanwhile, Jacob Eliosoff has said that if 80% of hash power signals Bit 4 via BIP-91 code by 25 July or so, it will start orphaning non-bit-1 blocks before August 1st, avoiding a split.</p>
