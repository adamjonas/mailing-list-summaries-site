    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal called splitprotection has been suggested as an alternative to the SegWit2x agreement, which some miners consider too slow. Splitprotection is essentially BIP91 but uses BIP8 instead of BIP9, with a lower activation threshold and immediate mandatory signaling lock-in. This enables a majority of miners to activate mandatory SegWit signaling and prevent a potential chain split before the August 1st BIP148 activation date. Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected, and users should either upgrade to split protection or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments.The website lists.linuxfoundation.org offers a mailing list for the development of Bitcoin called bitcoin-dev. Managed by the Linux Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium that advocates open-source software, this mailing list serves as a forum for developers to discuss issues related to the Bitcoin code and its protocol. It is open to anyone interested in contributing to Bitcoin's development, regardless of their expertise level.On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, developers collaborate on new ideas, share their experiences, and provide feedback on the existing codebase. Users can join the mailing list by following the provided link, which leads to the official registration page. This platform provides updates on the latest developments related to the Bitcoin protocol and its implementation, making it an essential resource for developers passionate about improving the functionality and security of Bitcoin. By promoting collaboration among developers, this mailing list helps drive innovation and progress in the world of cryptocurrency.</p>
