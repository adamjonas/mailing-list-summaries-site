    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to bitcoin-dev, Tao Effect expressed concern that the severity of replay attacks is not being voiced and is not understood within the Bitcoin community due to their lack of experience with them. However, another member of the community responded by saying that issues with replay were pointed out by the Bitcoin community to Ethereum in advance and were cited specifically in prior hardfork discussions long before Ethereum started editing their ledger for the economic benefit of its centralized administrators. The lack of extensive discussion on these issues is symptomatic of engineers that take stability seriously not taking BIP148 seriously, rather than people not knowing about them. The same concerns also apply to all other HF proposals, arguably even stronger. Replay isn't even the largest of the technical issues, as network partitioning is a much larger one. BIP149 is arguably something of another matter in particular because it has a time-frame that allows dealing with replay and other issues--and particularly because it has a time-frame that can allow for the avoidance of a meaningful fork at all.</p>
