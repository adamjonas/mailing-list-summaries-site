    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, Erik raised the question of whether BIP91 or a -BIP148 option would be merged to core for inclusion in the next release. The current situation requires miners to choose between BIP148 and Segwit2x if they want to activate Segwit, as there are no other options available. However, a large percentage of miners are indifferent towards this decision. Erik questions whether it is necessary to force miners to run non-core code in order to activate a popular feature. This raises concerns about the potential risks and drawbacks associated with running non-core code. It also highlights the need for a more streamlined and efficient process for implementing popular features in the future. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of considering the perspectives and needs of different stakeholders in the decision-making process, and finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.</p>
