    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal of a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to activate the existing SegWit deployment with only 65% miner support has been met with criticism by Jacob Eliosoff on the Bitcoin development mailing list. Eliosoff stated that this proposal should be corrected to orphan blocks only if more than 50% signal for BIP148, or define two bits, one meaning "I support BIP148," and the other "I will go w/ the miner majority on BIP148." James Hilliard proposed another option that miners can use to prevent a chain split ahead of the Aug. 1 BIP148 activation date, called SplitProtection soft fork. This new BIP allows miners to respond to market forces quickly. In response to the upcoming BIP148 activation, a new BIP has been proposed in the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which is compatible with both the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016, and midnight November 15th, 2017, and the existing BIP148 deployment. To ensure that miners are aware of new rules being enforced, IsSuperMajority() has been used to activate soft forks such as BIP66. This technique can be leveraged to lower the signaling threshold of a soft fork while it is in the process of being deployed in a backward-compatible way. By orphaning non-signaling blocks during the BIP9 bit 1 "segwit" deployment, this BIP can cause the existing "segwit" deployment to activate without needing to release a new deployment. As we approach BIP148 activation, it may be desirable for a majority of miners to have a method that ensures there is no chain split. While this bip is active, users should either upgrade to splitprotection or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments.
