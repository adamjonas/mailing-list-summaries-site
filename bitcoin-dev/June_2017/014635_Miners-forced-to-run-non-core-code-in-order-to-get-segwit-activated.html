    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is currently some "pre-signaling" going on with miners for segwit2x, which is still in alpha-phase. However, most of the segwit2x signaling miners are not actually signaling segwit as required, and it is possible that some may orphan their own blocks if they fail to do so. Segwit2x/BIP91/BIP148 will orphan miners who do not run a Segwit2x node or signal for segwit. While there may be a temporary chain split of 2-3 blocks, it is unlikely to be long-lasting due to the ~80% hashrate support for segwit2x. The rejection of segwit2x by Bitcoin's developers is resolute, and there is a strong correlation between those who support segwit2x and those who are unwilling or unable to keep updating the software at an acceptable level of quality. It is naive to assume that any shift would be temporary, but if miners want to create an altcoin, they can always do so.</p>
