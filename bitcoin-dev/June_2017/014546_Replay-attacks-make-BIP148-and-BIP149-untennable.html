    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Ethereum hard fork, Conner Fromknecht argued that any cryptocurrency's state should only be defined by its ledger and if the system can be altered outside the rules governing the ledger, it is not secure. He claimed that an "irregular state change" is equivalent to modifying the underlying ledger. Nick Johnson responded by stating that an irregular state change was added at a specific block height but the ledger remained inviolate. Tao Effect criticized Johnson for not understanding the severity of replay attacks possible with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Gregory Maxwell accused Ethereum of editing their ledger for the economic benefit of its centralized administrators. Johnson refuted this claim, stating that the Ethereum ledger was not edited.</p>
