    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange is about the use of 148 coinbase transactions over legacy coinbase transactions. CoinJoin is mentioned as a method for improving fungibility and mixing with coinbase transactions. The author suggests that coin-mixing may be a better option, as it could be reasonably easy for exchanges to obtain 148 coinbase coins and mix their coins with them. This would extend the coin-splitting capability beyond just miner coins and allow for splitting incoming coins. The author also mentions the possibility of double-spending on the lower hashrate chain with a higher fee to end up with different coins on both chains, but notes that this method is time-consuming and not guaranteed to work.</p>
