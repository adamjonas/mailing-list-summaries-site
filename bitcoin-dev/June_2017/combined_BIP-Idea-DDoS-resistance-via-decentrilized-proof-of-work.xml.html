        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ilya Eriklintsev, an author of an email to a bitcoin developer mailing list, has proposed a modification to the simple proof-of-work puzzle in order to improve the Bitcoin network. The proposal aims to incentivize all miners to include a transaction carrying a lot of value in the next block by extending the concept of proof-of-work. This would give a handicap to every miner who includes "mined" transactions into the next block, increasing their probability of receiving a block reward.The proposed solution would make the Bitcoin network more secure, decentralized, and DDoS resistant, preventing adversaries from impairing the network's ability to transfer value for everyone in the world, irrespective of their financial capability. Currently, the system relies on miners deciding which transactions to include in blocks, and the only incentive for users wanting to transfer their bitcoins is setting a transaction fee that goes directly to the miner. However, this fee market deviates significantly from a free-market premise. The proposed solution would incentivize miners to include transactions deemed important by their sender and supported by some amount of proof-of-work. By doing so, it could benefit both miners, who would be offered direct incentives to include important transactions, and users, who would have increased assurance that the transaction would be included in the next block. The protocol change could be implemented as a user-activated soft-fork.However, an adequate game theoretical model is required to investigate the probable consequences of the protocol upgrade and stability of implied economical equilibrium. Such a model and numerical simulation results should be obtained and studied before any protocol change could be considered by the community.Overall, the proposed solution addresses the issue of continuous DDoS attacks targeting the Bitcoin network, reducing the system's primary ability to transfer value. The solution makes the Bitcoin network more secure, decentralized, and DDoS resistant, thus preventing adversaries from impairing the network's ability to transfer value for everyone in the world, irrespective of their financial capability.</p>
