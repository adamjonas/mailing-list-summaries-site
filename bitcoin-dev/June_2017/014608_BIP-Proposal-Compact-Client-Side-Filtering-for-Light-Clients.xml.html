    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on whether the filtering of unconfirmed transactions is necessary was initiated by Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev. In response to this, it was pointed out that an SPV client requires filtering for a simple usability point of view when used as a payment receiver. However, many users would be willing to trade higher privacy using client-side filtering for not having the "incoming transaction" feature or if they want 0-conf, to fetch all involved transactions. In contrast, privacy issues are not a significant concern from a regular user's point of view. There have been only one inquiry about the BIP37's privacy problems in the past seven years, and over 50,000 inquiries about delayed/missing transactions in Bitcoin Wallet's existence. For most users, privacy is a non-issue, and they would only take it if it does not delay incoming payments or quickly eat up their traffic quota.</p>
