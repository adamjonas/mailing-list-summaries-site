    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has formally objected to BIP148 and BIP149 based on his experience with the ETH/ETC hard fork and involvement in that drama. It is important to note that ETC/ETH HF is a different situation from BIP148 and other soft-forks. The reasons should be self-evident, as one results in two incompatible chains, while the other doesn't. However, replay attacks are common to both possibilities. The author signs off by requesting not to receive emails that cannot be shared with the NSA.</p>
