    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The activation of Segwit before August 1, 2017, is likely to avoid a split. However, if activation is via Segwit2x, and at least some nodes do & some don't follow through with the HF three months later, then there will be a split probably in September or October. The miners can continue signaling segwit, which will leave them at least soft-fork compatible with BIP148 and BIP91. Ironically, most of the segwit2x signaling miners are faking it because they're not signaling segwit which it requires. Segwit2x/BIP91/BIP148 will orphan miners that do not run a Segwit2x (or BIP148) node because they wouldn't have the new consensus rule of requiring all blocks to signal for segwit. Miners who want to activate segwit will have to choose between BIP148 and Segwit2x.</p>
