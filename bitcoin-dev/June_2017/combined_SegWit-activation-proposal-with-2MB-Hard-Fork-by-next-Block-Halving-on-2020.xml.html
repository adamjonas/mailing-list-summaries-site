        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been put forward in the Bitcoin community to verify whether 50% of the transactions mined from the SegWit activation block to block 630000 are SegWit transactions. If this is confirmed, the legacy maximum block size would be increased to 2MB and the SegWit maximum block size to 8MB. The implementation of this proposal could be done in the next release of Bitcoin Core or may require a restart of the SegWit activation period while it is implemented and released.The aim of this proposal is to reduce the likelihood of a chain split while adhering to the original bitcoin scaling roadmap. The proposed increase in the maximum block size would allow for more transactions to be processed per block, which is essential for the growth of Bitcoin.This proposal follows the guidelines set out in a previous Bitcoin Development mailing list post from December 2015. It remains to be seen whether this proposal will be implemented, but it could have significant implications for the future of Bitcoin and its scalability.</p>
