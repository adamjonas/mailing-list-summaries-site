    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is related to the implementation of BIP91-like orphaning behavior in Bitcoin Core software. Gregory Maxwell suggests creating a patch for current (0.14.2) software to engage in the orphaning, but notes that there is no specification of the behavior yet. He refers to the latest code regarding BIP91 that got merged and states that it should be the spec to follow. He also mentions that all versions of Bitcoin Core since 0.13.1 signal segwit, even when downstream mining software doesn't support it. Hampus Sjöberg had previously stated that Segwit2x/BIP91/BIP148 will orphan miners that do not run a Segwit2x (or BIP148) node because they wouldn't have the new consensus rule of requiring all blocks to signal for segwit. James Hilliard is suggested as someone who could provide input on the matter.</p>
