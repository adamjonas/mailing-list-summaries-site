    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 7, 2017, Tao Effect sent an email to Nick Johnson asking him not to spread misinformation about the Ethereum hard fork. Johnson had suggested that the Ethereum ledger was edited, but Tao Effect clarified that only an irregular state change was added at a specific block height and the ledger remains inviolate. Later in the email thread, Gregory Maxwell cautioned against insulting the Bitcoin community and accused Ethereum of editing their ledger for centralized economic benefit. However, Johnson reiterated that the Ethereum ledger was not edited. The discussion also touched on the severity of replay attacks in the Bitcoin community and the lack of experience in dealing with them.</p>
