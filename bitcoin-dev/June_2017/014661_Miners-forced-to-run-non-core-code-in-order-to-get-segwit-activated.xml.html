    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context provided is related to the development of bitcoin software and the communication between developers. The conversation takes place on a mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation, which is an important resource for those involved in the development of bitcoin. On June 20th, 2017, Mark Friedenbach wrote that 80% have set "NYA" in their coinbase string and people are equating it to BIP 91 -- but BIP 91 did not exist at the time of the New York agreement and differs from the actual text of the NYA in substantive ways. This indicates confusion among developers regarding the implementation of the New York Agreement (NYA), a proposal for scaling the bitcoin network.On June 21st, 2017, Jacob Eliosoff via bitcoin-dev stated that a group of miners in China intend to support the NYA in the coinbase as support for "the New York consensus SegWit2x program btc1 (<a href="https://github.com/btc1)">https://github.com/btc1)</a>", whose code includes the (accelerated 336-block) BIP 91 change. This suggests that there may be some progress towards implementing the NYA, but it is unclear whether this is being done in a way that fulfills the original agreement.On June 27th, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner via bitcoin-dev stated that currently the only implementation that fulfills the requirements of the NYA agreement is the segwit2x/btc1 implementation, which will be finalized this week. Segwit2mb does not fulfill the NYA agreement. He asked when a BIP would be ready so that Core has the opportunity to evaluate the technical proposal. This further highlights the complexity and ongoing discussion around the implementation of the NYA, and the need for collaboration and evaluation among developers.</p>
