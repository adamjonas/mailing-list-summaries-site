    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, the topic of user choice and the role of miners in Bitcoin's consensus rules is discussed. The original email raises concerns about the degree of centralization in mining pools and the importance of users enforcing the system's rules. The responder clarifies that users have the choice to abandon nodes and that the BIP being discussed can be applied to almost any upgrade but notes that the upgrade is not the key point. The responder questions whether users truly have a choice and expresses confusion over why they would trust majority miners but refuse to vote for upcoming protocol upgrades. The responder emphasizes that Bitcoin is not a democracy and that once a feature has been vetted and code deployed, miners may signal readiness to enforce new rules. However, if miners are too passive or veto activation of new rules, users may circumvent said veto. The responder discusses the choice for wallet users and emphasizes the importance of not having faith in miners when it comes to choosing consensus rules. Finally, the responder clarifies that the BIP being discussed involves temporarily invalidating tx version 1 and is a soft fork.</p>
