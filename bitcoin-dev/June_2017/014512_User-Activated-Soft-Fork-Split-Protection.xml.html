    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 6, 2017, James Hilliard proposed a new option for miners to prevent a chain split ahead of the Aug 1st BIP148 activation date due to the proposed calendar being too slow to activate SegWit mandatory signalling ahead of BIP148 using BIP91. This option is called splitprotection soft fork and is essentially BIP91 but with a lower activation threshold and immediate mandatory signalling lock-in, using BIP8 instead of BIP9. Splitprotection allows for a majority of miners to activate mandatory SegWit signalling and prevent a potential chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. The splitprotection soft fork is compatible with the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016, and midnight November 15th, 2017, as well as the existing BIP148 deployment. The biggest risk of BIP148 is an extended chain split, and this BIP provides a way for a simple majority of miners to eliminate that risk. Since the primary goal of this BIP is to reduce the chance of an extended chain split, it activates using a simple miner majority of 65% over a 504 block interval rather than a higher percentage. While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1 existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected.This BIP also allows miners to signal their intention to run BIP148 in order to prevent a chain split. The reference implementation can be found on GitHub. Miners will need to upgrade their nodes to support splitprotection; otherwise, they may build on top of an invalid block. While this BIP is active, users should either upgrade to splitprotection or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments.</p>
