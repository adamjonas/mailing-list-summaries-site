    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion between bitcoin developers, Zheming Lin proposed a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to address the passive and lazy behavior of non-mining wallet nodes in upgrading consensus. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that this was not true as non-mining wallet nodes were considered in the white paper and their upgrade practices are not usually slower than miners. Maxwell also mentioned that many miners have the most severe form of passive behavior as they do not run a node at all but simply sell their hash power to pools. He believes that reliability cannot be maintained in infrastructure if it is rapidly changing, and upgrades often happen slower than even centralized ISP backbones upgrade their router software. Lin responded by stating that the choice for wallet users right now is whether to follow the 51% majority miners and that users can have their fork that gets rid of miners if they don't trust them.</p>
