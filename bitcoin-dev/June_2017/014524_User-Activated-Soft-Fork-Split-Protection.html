    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed split protection soft fork is designed to prevent a potential chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. It is essentially BIP91 but with a lower activation threshold and immediate mandatory signaling lock-in, using BIP8 instead of BIP9. This allows a majority of miners to activate mandatory SegWit signaling. However, due to time constraints, BIP91 may not be able to enforce mandatory signaling of SegWit before the August 1st activation of BIP148.The split protection deployment is compatible with the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016, and midnight November 15th, 2017. Each threshold reduction makes it more likely to succeed, but also increases the likelihood of harm to the ecosystem.To ensure mandatory signaling activation regardless of miner signaling levels, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) discussed in this mailing list is compatible with BIP148. The existing "segwit" deployment can be activated without requiring a new deployment by orphaning non-signaling blocks during the BIP9 bit 1 "segwit" deployment.As BIP148 activation approaches, a majority of miners may desire a method to ensure that there is no chain split. The references provided include discussions on mailing lists, flag day activation, and various BIPs related to version bits, pay to script hash, segregated witness, transaction signature verification, dealing with dummy stack element malleability, and mandatory activation of segwit deployment.This document is dual licensed as BSD 3-clause and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>
