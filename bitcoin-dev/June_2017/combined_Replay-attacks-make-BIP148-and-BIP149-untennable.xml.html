        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread on June 6, 2017, Tao Effect via bitcoin-dev expressed concern over the lack of understanding and discussion around replay attacks within the Bitcoin community. However, a response to this email from another member of the community pointed out that the issues with replay have already been addressed in prior hardfork discussions, particularly in regards to Ethereum. The lack of extensive discussion may be due to engineers who take stability seriously not taking BIP148 seriously. Additionally, other hardfork proposals also pose concerns that have been called out as ill-advised by those who see the technical issues. Replay is not even the largest of these technical issues, with network partitioning being a much larger problem. BIP149 has a timeframe for dealing with the replay issue and other potential problems, which could allow for the avoidance of a meaningful fork altogether.In a separate email in the thread, Tao Effect via bitcoin-dev expressed concern about mixing with 148 coinbase transactions destroying fungibility. However, CoinJoin can work as a method of both improving fungibility and mixing with coinbase transactions. It was suggested that splitting a coin is unnecessary and sending a transaction with a standard fee will get confirmed on the higher hashrate chain but won't confirm as quickly on the lower hashrate chain. When it's confirmed on one chain but not the other, you can then "double-spend" on the lower hashrate chain with a higher fee to end up with different coins on both chains. The email thread also includes a formal objection to BIP148 and BIP149 based on experience with the ETH/ETC hard fork and involvement in that drama. However, the situation with ETC/ETH HF is very different from BIP148 and all other soft-forks. Replay attacks are common to both possibilities.</p>
