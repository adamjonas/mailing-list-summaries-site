    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community has proposed a new soft fork upgrade called "split protection" that will be compatible with the existing SegWit deployment. The proposed calendar for the SegWit2x agreement is too slow to activate SegWit mandatory signaling ahead of BIP148 using BIP91. James Hilliard, in a message to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, has proposed a new option that miners can use to prevent a chain split ahead of the Aug 1st BIP148 activation date, called "splitprotection". The splitprotection soft fork is essentially BIP91 but with a lower activation threshold and immediate mandatory signaling lock-in. This allows for a majority of miners to activate mandatory SegWit signaling and prevent a potential chain split ahead of BIP148 activation. The biggest risk of BIP148 is an extended chain split, this BIP provides a way for a simple majority of miners to eliminate that risk. Any miners already running BIP148 should be encouraged to use splitprotection.The proposal is to reduce the chance of an extended chain split as much as possible by activating using a simple miner majority of 65% over a 504 block interval rather than a higher percentage. This BIP also allows miners to signal their intention to run BIP148 in order to prevent a chain split. While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1<<<<existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected. This BIP will cease to be active when segwit is locked-in.Miners will need to upgrade their nodes to support split protection otherwise they may build on top of an invalid block. While this bip is active users should either upgrade to split protection or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments. By orphaning non-signalling blocks during the BIP9 bit 1 "segwit" deployment, this BIP can cause the existing "segwit" deployment to activate without needing to release a new deployment. The split protection upgrade leverages `IsSuperMajority()` to activate soft forks such as BIP66 which has a mandatory signalling requirement for miners once activated, this ensures that miners are aware of new rules being enforced. This technique can be leveraged to lower the signalling threshold of a soft fork while it is in the process of being deployed in a backwards compatible way. A BIP8 style timeout is used to ensure that this BIP is compatible with BIP148 and that BIP148 compatible mandatory signalling activates regardless of miner signalling levels.As we approach BIP148 activation it may be desirable for a majority of miners to have a method that will ensure that there is no chain split. The proposal also includes a list of references including mailing list discussions, version bits with timeout and delay, pay to script hash, reduced threshold Segwit MASF, segregated witness, transaction signature verification for Version 0 Witness Program, dealing with dummy stack element malleability, mandatory activation of segwit deployment, segregated witness (second deployment), and Segwit benefits.
