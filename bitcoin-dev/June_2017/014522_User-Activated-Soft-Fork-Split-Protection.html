    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>James Hilliard, one of the developers of the SegWit2x agreement, has proposed a solution for miners to prevent a chain split ahead of the August 1 BIP148 activation date. According to his proposal, miners could activate the existing segwit deployment with less than 95% hashpower before BIP148 activation. This would be done using a simple miner majority of 65% over a 504 block interval instead of a higher percentage. The goal of this BIP is to minimize the risk of an extended chain split and to allow miners to signal their intention to run BIP148 in order to avoid a chain split. Additionally, it is recommended that any miners who are already running BIP148 should use split protection.The document also contains a list of several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) related to the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is a protocol upgrade that separates transaction signature data from transaction data. These BIPs include BIP9 Version bits with timeout and delay, BIP16 Pay to Script Hash, BIP91 Reduced threshold Segwit MASF, BIP141 Segregated Witness (Consensus layer), BIP143 Transaction Signature Verification for Version 0 Witness Program, BIP147 Dealing with dummy stack element malleability, BIP148 Mandatory activation of segwit deployment, and BIP149 Segregated Witness (second deployment). Moreover, the document includes a link to a page discussing the advantages of SegWit. The document is dual licensed as BSD 3-clause and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>
