    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion between Chris and Olaoluwa Osuntokun took place on the bitcoin-dev forum regarding the support for unconfirmed transactions in BIP drafts. Olaoluwa expressed his view that direct support for unconfirmed transactions would be an important user experience (UX) feature for mobile phones, especially for on-boarding new users to Bitcoin. Chris agreed with this idea and suggested that bip37 filtering could be kept optional for unconfirmed transactions. However, another participant argued that it would be bad for privacy since data for transactions at the tip is only 14kb/s and potentially less if segwit is in use and you're not getting witnesses. They also pointed out that leaving a mobile browser running while pointing at some websites seems to use more traffic than that just loading advertising.</p>
