    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, James Hilliard provides detailed feedback on a proposed method for activating protocol upgrades through miners' votes. The activation would only require majority miners' signal and could be implemented at 55% hash power without an orphaning period. However, false signaling is still a potential problem that cannot be solved. Non-mining nodes will not be affected during the first two grace periods, but they must upgrade their software afterward. The ledger in non-mining wallet nodes is reserved, and users of off-chain wallet services can decide whether or not to follow the service providers after public notification. In the future, protocol upgrades can be bonded with node upgrades, and the activation can be done through miners' votes independently. The risks include hashing power fluctuation, false signaling, conspiring between miners and non-mining nodes to fork using old protocol consensus, etc. Miners need to vote unbiasedly under the condition that most users are not affected by protocol upgrading. Implementation details are yet to be determined.</p>
