    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation discusses the potential issues with implementing a drivechain and how it may affect different groups involved in the mining process, such as block header generators, hashers, and ASIC manufacturers. These groups have different needs for internet connectivity, electricity, and capital. The idea of using UTXO commitments for sidechains is suggested as an alternative to merged mining. However, there are concerns about the cost and security of this method. It is also noted that the design of the inflation schedule should balance transaction costs to make sure that sidechains are always cheaper than bitcoin. The conversation ends with discussion about how the lightning model could be used to watch fees increase and prevent further centralization.</p>
