    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing the implementation of SegWit2x, which aims to increase the block size limit to 2MB. This move follows a debate that has been ongoing for several years regarding the scalability of Bitcoin's blockchain. The NYA agreement requires miners to signal their support for either BIP148 or SegWit2x in order to activate SegWit. Currently, over 80% of miners are signaling for SegWit2x, but some miners are not actually running it yet.There are concerns within the community about the implementation of SegWit2x. A pull request has been made to the Bitcoin Core software for a technical proposal evaluation, but Core developers have expressed their rejection of SegWit2x due to its lack of proper technical design and the need for miners to run non-reference software. Some members of the community have also raised concerns about the centralization of power among large mining pools that could result from the implementation of SegWit2x.While it is likely that SegWit will be activated before August 1st, there may still be a split if miners do not follow through with the hard fork three months later. This could lead to a separate chain being created, resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin. The potential for a split has caused concern within the community, as it could have significant implications for the value and use of Bitcoin. These discussions are taking place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which is a forum for developers and technical experts in the Bitcoin community to exchange ideas and discuss issues related to the protocol. The mailing list is open to anyone who wishes to subscribe, and can be accessed through the Linux Foundation website. It provides a space for technical debates such as those surrounding SegWit2x, and plays an important role in shaping the future of Bitcoin.</p>
