    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on August 5th, 2022, Bitcoin Core contributor Ali Sherief discussed the importance of advancing BIP322 as the first priority. He mentioned that while the proposal has superior message verification capabilities, wallets are not currently using it, likely due to it being a draft and incomplete. Message signatures are relied upon in some places, such as mining pools and forums, but they are not useful for proving that a transaction was sent or for accessing bitcoins. Sherief likened BIP322 to a "bumper car" that enforces compliance with previous BIPs extending the message signing format, particularly BIP137. However, fellow contributor Luke Dashjr expressed his opinion that there is no benefit to an additional message signing standard, especially one that does not address the problems with the current standard or BIP322.</p>
