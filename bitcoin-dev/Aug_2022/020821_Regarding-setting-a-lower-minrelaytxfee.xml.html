    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It is possible to find nodes that accept low-fee transactions, and on some statistics, zero to one satoshi per virtual byte transactions could take more space than other transactions. However, miners do not have to accept such low fee transactions as long as the basic block reward is sufficient. Some miners could also accept only 10 sats/vB or higher. For now, the de-facto standard is one satoshi per virtual byte, but there is no hard consensus rule. Fees are not a part of the consensus, so they can be freely adjusted by each node, and there is no way to make sure what rules are really executed, you can only assume that based on what transactions are included in blocks. In response to a question about the feasibility of attaching work to low fee transactions, Peter Todd explained that they were not talking about a consensus system, just a way to rate-limit access to a broadcast network used by a small minority of nodes. It's completely ok to simply change the PoW algorithm in the highly unlikely event someone bothers to build an ASIC for it. Since this isn't a consensus system, it's totally ok if multiple versions of the scheme run in parallel.</p>
