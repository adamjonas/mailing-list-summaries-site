    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for an open, decentralized process for investigating problem and solution spaces has been put forward by Antoine Riard on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal involves using IRC as a platform for discussion, with in-person meetups organized every few meetings to cut through any misunderstandings. The group would go through six phases, starting with defining the phases themselves, then defining and prioritizing motivations and constraints, evaluating proposals based on those factors and other criteria, and producing a set of conclusions on which proposals are worth pursuing further. Each phase would be discussed over multiple meetings, with consensus reached at the end of each phase being considered a group consensus. Results would be published more widely after each phase to get broader community feedback, including detailed evaluations of each proposal. The process could be revisited at any stage if necessary, with the aim of narrowing down the set of proposals to one or two worth pursuing. A separate discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list involves defining and providing examples of capabilities in the Bitcoin context, such as payments into vaults, oracles, and colored coins.</p>
