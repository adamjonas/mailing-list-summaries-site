    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Peter Todd and Antoine Riard regarding the adoption of full-replace-by-fee (full-rbf) patch, free from political frameworks and reasoning from scientific or engineering principles, took place. As the patch is now merged in Core, the focus is on explaining the fee upsides of turning on the full-rbf setting to enough miners. However, public broadcast-all communication channels between developers and mining operators are missing, so reaching out to each miner individually is left as the only option. Antoine Riard experimented with one of his OTS calendars, issuing fee-bumping transactions without the opt-in RBF flag set, which showed no signs of full-rbf hash power at this moment. Though it could also be a lack of full-rbf propagation path towards potential hash power. Peter Todd suggests advocating for the new policy setting to mining node operators right away, without waiting for the patch to get merged, to improve the politics of getting it merged. This is because miners tend to run customized bitcoind's anyway.</p>
