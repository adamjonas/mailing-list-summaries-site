        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Michael Folkson discusses the history of Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and BIP125. RBF rules were merged into Bitcoin Core in November 2015, followed by the drafting of BIP125 by David Harding and Peter Todd. However, it was discovered in May 2021 that the Bitcoin Core implementation of the RBF rules had never matched the RBF rules outlined in BIP125.Folkson points out that L2 security is impacted by default policy rules to some extent and suggests that we should aspire to similar standards for policy as consensus changes, given L2 protocol security relies on them. He thinks we should strive towards the highest possible standards for step change default policy changes in Core.The new RBF rules replacing the BIP125 rules are documented in the Core repository, though it is unclear whether they are a work in progress or close to final. In general, standards should be improving and becoming more rigorous, and the norm for material step change policy changes should be a specification and a reference implementation, similar to the norm for consensus changes.In a follow-up message, Peter Todd argues that transaction relay schemes are additive security and that we should be thinking about how to add diversity and robustness to this in the form of different schemes rather than trying to specify exactly how we expect these transactions to be broadcast. He suggests getting package relay and package replacements implemented to avoid edge-cases in multiple-tx schemes and considering something entirely different, like a hashcase-based broadcast scheme.The author argues that stakeholders in L2 protocol security should care about where things are documented, and suggests that a detailed static, well-reviewed BIP standard that lays out updated RBF rules and rationales could be preferable to cross-checking Bitcoin Core code with non-standardized documentation. Security should never depend on assumptions of node policies. Since BIP125 is widely implemented, it should not be changed except for corrections to things that are errors deviating from the original intent.</p>
