    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alfred has responded to Ruben's feedback and incorporated his suggestion of using only the first four bytes of the notification code. Alfred has also added Ruben as a co-author. In response to hiding the recipient in the notification, Alfred explains that it is not only meant to allow Alice to send a notification herself but also to break the link between the notifier and Bob. This avoids social graph building issues similar to those found in BIP47 and unique per-recipient notification addresses. However, light clients will need to rely on some OP_RETURN indexing service. Alfred considers this inconvenience acceptable since it reduces social metadata on the blockchain, prevents censorship of certain recipients by notification services, allows wallets to choose their level of outsourcing, and protects against attacks from adversaries monitoring notifications.</p>
