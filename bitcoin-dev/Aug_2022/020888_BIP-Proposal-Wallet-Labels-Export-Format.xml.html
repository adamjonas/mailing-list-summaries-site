    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Craig Raw proposed a new BIP that specifies a format for the export and import of labels from a wallet. The proposed format is a simple two-column CSV file, with the reference to a transaction, address, input, or output in the first column, and the label in the second column. The full text of the BIP can be found on Github. The motivation behind the proposal is to provide a standard for transferring labels between different Bitcoin wallet applications to avoid lock-in to any particular wallet. Craig's proposal received feedback from Clark, who asked how it compares with SLIP-0015, which provides encryption by default. Clark suggested exploring a merge of the two approaches and shared a link to the SLIP-0015 document on Github. Craig did not respond to Clark's suggestion in the email thread. The proposed format uses comma-separated values (CSV), which is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. The CSV file may be compressed using the ZIP format and optionally encrypted using AES. When importing, a naive algorithm may simply match against any reference, but it is possible to disambiguate between transactions, addresses, inputs, and outputs. Importing applications may truncate labels if necessary. A test vector is provided in the email thread as an example. At the time of the email conversation, there was no reference implementation available. The proposed BIP is currently in draft status and has not received any comments yet. The BIP is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.</p>
