    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Ali Sherief and Luke Dashjr, the former proposes advancing a specific BIP before considering Taproot/Schorr and two related extensions. The reason for focusing on this BIP is to provide a reference manual for computing ECSDA sign/verify correctly, which would help address the issue of wallets not implementing sign/verify correctly due to the lack of a reference manual. This BIP would also force compliance with previous BIPs that extend the message signing format, in particular BIP137. However, Luke Dashjr expresses skepticism about the need for an additional message signing standard that doesn't address the problems with the current standard or BIP322, which has superior message verification capabilities but suffers from the drawback of not being used by wallets due to being a draft and incomplete.</p>
