    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ali Sherief has created a new BIP called 'notatether-signedmessage' that defines a step-by-step process for signing and verifying messages from legacy, native/nested segwit, and taproot addresses. It does not define a new signature format itself, except in the case of Taproot. For those addresses, he has defined a signature format that has 1 byte header/recID, 64 bytes signature, and 32 bytes x coordinate of a public key. This is required to run the BIP340 Schnorr verify algorithm using only the signature - and the header byte is added for backwards compatibility. Otherwise, it completely integrates BIP137 signatures. Pavol Rusnak suggested that Ali should focus more on things he is adding (Taproot) while saying his BIP is an expansion of BIP137. He proposed that Ali move the algorithms (of BIP137) and stuff to Bitcoin Wiki, and then convert the BIP to strictly a "Taproot message signing BIP". Ali plans to move that format to its own BIP as soon as possible, in lieu that it is unacceptable to define formats in an Informational BIP. Ali ultimately prefers that everyone should use BIP322 eventually, though it should have some kind of RFC2440-like format for maximum user-friendliness.</p>
