        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new version of Bitcoin's Silent Payment implementation has been introduced through a Pull Request update (PR #24897) on the Bitcoin codebase on GitHub. This updated version improves upon the previous implementation by eliminating manual steps and introducing a new descriptor type called "sp()". This descriptor type contains exactly one key and generates a unique 'silent-payment' address.The silent payment address can be used as one of the outputs in a transaction, alongside standard addresses. The "send" RPC automatically identifies and tweaks the silent payment address. The output generated is a standard Taproot script with HRP changed from "bc" to "sp" on the mainnet or "tsp" on testnet and signet.It is important to note that the introduction of silent payments does not affect the consensus or auditability rules. These silent transactions are still included in publicly auditable blocks. The only difference is that the addresses cannot be hierarchically derived with BIP44 or any other path.Some critics have expressed concerns about the auditability of these transactions. However, Ali, the developer behind this update, explains that the silent payments are still publicly auditable and adhere to the original consensus that gave Bitcoin fungibility. Despite this explanation, some critics remain skeptical.To facilitate the review process, a step-by-step signet tutorial has been created for testers to easily test this new version. Overall, this updated version of Bitcoin's Silent Payment implementation simplifies the process of making silent payments, making it easier and more efficient for users.</p>
