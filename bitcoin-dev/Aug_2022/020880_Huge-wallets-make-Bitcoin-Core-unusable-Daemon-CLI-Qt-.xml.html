    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Felipe Micaroni Lalli raised two questions on bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the optimization of Bitcoin wallet module. The first question was about optimizing a large wallet without moving funds to a new one. In response, it was suggested to use removeprunedfunds RPC which can remove old transactions and speed up balance calculations and transaction creation. The second question was about improving cache usage by putting the entire wallet in memory. However, it was clarified that the wallet is already entirely in memory. The issue with the wallet module is a known one and changing it takes significant time as it is a large module in Bitcoin Core.</p>
