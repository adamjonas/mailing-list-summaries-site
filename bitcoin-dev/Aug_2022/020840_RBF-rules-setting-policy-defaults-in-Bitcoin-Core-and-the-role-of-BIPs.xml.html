    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Michael Folkson outlines the history of Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and BIP125. RBF rules were merged into Bitcoin Core in November 2015, followed by the drafting of BIP125 by David Harding and Peter Todd. However, it was discovered in May 2021 that the Bitcoin Core implementation of the RBF rules had never matched the RBF rules outlined in BIP125. There are now two views on what to do next: either ditch the idea of a specification for RBF rules and just document them in the Core repo instead, or have a new specification for the RBF rules in Core and attempt to correct the mistakes made with BIP125 by having a BIP that does correctly outline the RBF rules implemented in Core and includes detailed rationales for why those RBF rules have been implemented. In a follow-up message, Peter Todd argues that transaction relay schemes are additive security and that we should be thinking about how to add diversity and robustness to this in the form of different schemes rather than trying to specify exactly how we expect these transactions to be broadcast. He suggests getting package relay and package replacements implemented to avoid edge-cases in multiple-tx schemes and considering something entirely different, like a hashcase-based broadcast scheme.</p>
