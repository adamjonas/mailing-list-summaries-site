    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ali Sherief has created a new BIP called notatether-signedmessage that defines a step-by-step process for signing and verifying messages from various types of Bitcoin addresses. The BIP does not define a new signature format, except for Taproot, where a signature format is defined that includes a 1-byte header/recID, 64-byte signature, and 32-byte x-coordinate of a public key. This format is necessary to run the BIP340 Schnorr verify algorithm using only the signature. The BIP completely integrates BIP137 signatures, and Ali plans to move the Taproot signature format to its own BIP soon. Pavol Rusnak responded to Ali's message, suggesting that it would be easier to understand if Ali focused on what he was adding (Taproot) rather than trying to expand on BIP137. Pavol also suggested that Ali clearly state that he is just expanding on BIP137 and removing everything already described in the original BIP. This would make it more obvious to everyone whether Ali is changing anything in the handling of ECDSA signature types or not.</p>
