    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3 has been released, with only bug fixes and updated translations, and it is recommended to upgrade to this release. Users can report bugs using the issue tracker at Github. Upgrading instructions have also been provided for those who are running an older version. However, downgrading warnings have been issued as well, as the 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous releases. The release notes detail the changes in RPC, Protocol and network code, Wallet, GUI, and Miscellaneous categories. The IsStandard() scriptSig length has also been increased. The contributors to this release have been acknowledged, as well as those who helped translate on Transifex.</p>
