    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2014, Jeff Garzik criticized the use of PGP Web of Trust (WoT) for identity verification. He argued that a person's behavioral signature is more relevant and that we know how "Satoshi" coded and wrote. Garzik suggested that the online Satoshi's PGP signature would be fine if he established a pattern of use. In a blog post, a game was proposed to combine the WoT and behavior signature. The author argued that identity is not just a name but a set of shared experiences with other people, and successful identity systems should focus on those shared experiences. A link to a video about email encryption was also included. Two attachments, one containing PGP keys and another with a digital signature, were also present.</p>
