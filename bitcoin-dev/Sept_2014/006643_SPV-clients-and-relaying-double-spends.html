    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a discussion about having nodes alert the network about double spend attempts by relaying them in order to accommodate the increasing usage of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets. SPV clients use the propagation of transactions across the network to judge how likely a transaction is to be confirmed. However, there are concerns that relaying double-spends without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid will make SPV clients more susceptible to 0 confirmation double spend attacks. The suggestion is to have nodes send reject messages similar to BIP61 to indicate which transactions they believe to be invalid but are relaying anyway. Although this method is subject to sybil attacks and monitoring propagation, it increases the cost of performing a 0 confirmation double spend attack on an SPV client above just relaying double-spends. Aaron Voisine from breadwallet.com raises this issue as more users will be using SPV wallets in the future.</p>
