    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated 09/12/2014, Aaron Voisine proposed that BIP72 should require signed payment requests from the same domain as the merchant. He suggested that merchants could store their signed payment requests on their payment processors' servers rather than having them displayed directly to customers, which would provide better user experience by showing the actual merchant instead of just the payment processor (as is currently done when buying from Humble Bundle). However, he did not think it was necessary for BIP72 to require HTTPS, as HTTP is commonly used and the proposed spec allows for other transports like Bluetooth.</p>
