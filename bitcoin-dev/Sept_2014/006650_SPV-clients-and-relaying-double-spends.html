    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context is about having nodes relay double-spends to alert the network about double spend attempts. The concern raised is that an attacker may flood the network by broadcasting millions of spends of the same output, which could overwhelm nodes with slower connections. To prevent this, one suggestion is to propagate a double-spend alert rather than relaying the actual transactions after the first one. However, it is also suggested that nodes should send BIP61 reject messages to indicate which transactions they believe to be invalid but are still relaying. This would increase the cost of performing a 0 confirmation double spend attack on an SPV client above just relaying double-spends without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid. It is noted that this approach would still be subject to sybil attacks, but it would increase the likelihood of detecting double-spends. Aaron Voisine of breadwallet.com suggests that this approach would be helpful for SPV clients that can't detect double spends on their own.</p>
