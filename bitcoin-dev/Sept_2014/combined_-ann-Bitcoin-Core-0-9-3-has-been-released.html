        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Melvin Carvalho commended the individuals who assisted in translating Bitcoin documentation on Transifex. He also expressed his curiosity about a specific change in the Bitcoin code, which involved increasing the IsStandard() scriptSig length. Peter Todd, the individual responsible for the change, eliminated the limitations on the number of public keys for P2SH CHECKMULTISIG outputs. Previously, there were restrictions that prevented multisig scriptPubKey's requiring more signatures from running out of scriptSig space, even though a 1-of-12 P2SH could be spent in a standard transaction. The increase in scriptSig space only allows for signatures, meaning that not much has changed in terms of "stuffing data in the blockchain." Additionally, utilizing more outputs is easy and inexpensive. In the main.cpp file, the limit for the largest standard txin was raised to 1650 bytes.Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3 has been released, focusing solely on bug fixes and updated translations. It is strongly recommended that users upgrade to this release. Users can report any bugs they encounter using the issue tracker at Github. Instructions for upgrading have been provided for those currently using an older version. However, cautionary warnings have also been issued regarding downgrading, as the 'chainstate' in this release may not always be compatible with previous versions. The release notes outline changes in RPC, Protocol and network code, Wallet, GUI, and Miscellaneous categories. The increase in IsStandard() scriptSig length has also been implemented. Recognition has been given to the contributors of this release, as well as those who aided in translation on Transifex.Bitcoin Core version 0.9.3 has been released, bringing with it updated translations and solely focusing on bug fixes. Users are highly encouraged to upgrade their systems to this latest release. For those running an older version, the process involves shutting it down and then running the installer on Windows, or copying over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt on Mac, or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt on Linux. If upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the blockchain files will be re-indexed for the first time. However, it is important to note that the 'chainstate' in this release may not always be compatible with previous versions. In such cases, users should run the old release with the -reindex option to rebuild the chainstate data structures when switching back to a 0.8.x release. The new release includes several updates, such as resolving a segfault issue on getblock if it fails to read a block from disk in RPC. In Protocol and network code, the release no longer polls showmyip.com as it no longer exists. In Wallet, it checks that the redeemScript size does not exceed the 520-byte limit, and provides warnings for redeemScripts that are too long while loading the wallet. In GUI, it fixes the display of unicode characters on MacOSX. OpenSSL has been upgraded to version 1.0.1i, and miniupnpc has been upgraded to version 1.9.20140701. Numerous contributors, including Andrew Poelstra, Cory Fields, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Johnathan Corgan, Julian Haight, Michael Ford, Pavel Vasin, Peter Todd, phantomcircuit, Pieter Wuille, Rose Toomey, Ruben Dario Ponticelli, shshshsh, Trevin Hofmann, Warren Togami, Wladimir J. van der Laan, and Zak Wilcox, have played key roles in bringing about this release. The contributions of all those who assisted in translating on Transifex are also greatly appreciated.</p>
