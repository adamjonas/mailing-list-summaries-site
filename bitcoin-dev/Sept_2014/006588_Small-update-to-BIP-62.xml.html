    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion about the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 62, Gregory Maxwell raised concerns about the lack of specificity in rule 4, which could lead to different interpretations of what constitutes a "push operation." Pieter Wuille acknowledged the issue and agreed to write an update to address it. He also proposed expanding the rules to include 6, as there are no use cases for zero-padded numbers. Rules 1 and 3 would be excluded due to their potential impact on current wallets and complex scripts, respectively. Another suggestion was to reorder the rules so that those applicable to all transactions were first. Wuille agreed to make this change. The conversation also brought up the idea that scriptPubkey can specify rules that are inherently malleable, which is not addressed in the current text. Wuille promised to reword the document to avoid confusion and ensure people understand that such isomorphisms exist.</p>
