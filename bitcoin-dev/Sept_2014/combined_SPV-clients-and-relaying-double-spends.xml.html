        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The idea of nodes relaying double-spends to alert the network about double spend attempts was discussed by Aaron Voisine in 2014, during an ongoing discussion about having nodes alert the network about double spend attempts. This was suggested to accommodate the increasing usage of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets. SPV clients use the propagation of transactions across the network to judge how likely a transaction is to be confirmed. However, there were concerns that relaying double-spends without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid will make SPV clients more susceptible to 0 confirmation double spend attacks. To prevent this, after two attempts to spend the same output, no further transactions spending that same output should be relayed. Aaron also proposed that nodes send BIP61 reject messages or something similar to indicate which transactions they believe to be invalid but are relaying anyway. This technique would increase the cost of performing a 0 confirmation double spend attack on an SPV client above just relaying double-spends without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid. However, it could be subject to sybil attacks. Although this method is not foolproof, it serves as a useful deterrent against attackers broadcasting multiple spends of the same output(s) and overwhelming nodes with slower connections.During a discussion on 25th September 2014, Aaron Voisine shared his opinion that nodes should not propagate alerts without independent verification. He raised the question of how a node could independently verify a double-spend alert other than having access to an actual signed double-spend. In response to this, #4570 was relayed as the first double-spend alert. The person running this branch on mainnet maintained a live list of relayed double-spend transactions.The ongoing discussion about nodes propagating double-spends includes the suggestion to propagate a double-spend alert after the first attempt to spend the same output(s), but not relay any further transactions spending that same output. This would help SPV clients judge how likely a transaction is to be confirmed and prevent network overload. However, this technique would still be subject to sybil attacks. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, and the links provided can be found for additional information.</p>
