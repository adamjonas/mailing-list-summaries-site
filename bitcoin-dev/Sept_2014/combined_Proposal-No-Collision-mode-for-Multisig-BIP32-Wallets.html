        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Alan Reiner requested a recap and link for a discussion provided by Justus Ranvier on the Open Transactions wiki. The BIP numbering process was criticized, and Open-Transactions resolved this by changing their proposal naming scheme and purpose codes. Justus Ranvier expressed disappointment in not being mentioned in Alan's work, which they shared in January and have been publicly documenting since then. In response, Alan asked Justus to recap/link the information for inclusion. Alan clarified that he receives many emails and nine months is a long time in this field, so he didn't want Justus to assume any negative intentions. Alan emphasized that he has no problem giving credit where it is due.In September 2014, Alan Reiner asked for suggestions to change the name "No-Collision Mode." Justus Ranvier proposed calling it a "voting pool wallet" since that was its original application. Justus also requested that Reiner mention their work, as they had publicly documented it since sharing it with him in January. Justus questioned whether implementing the idea in btcwallet made it unmentionable. The message included a PGP signature and an attachment of public key ID 0x38450DB5.The proposal is for a BIP related to multisig wallets based on BIP32. It suggests having N internal chains and N external chains for an M-of-N multisig wallet. Each party is assigned a chain based on the lexicographic ordering of their wallet's root public key, ensuring no duplication of addresses. This system provides built-in bookkeeping and allows easy identification of transaction responsibility. An alternative suggestion is assigning each "device" a pair of chains, such as in a 2-of-3 scenario with a CFO having a "watch-only" version of the wallet. The document linked in the proposal contains visual descriptions of the concept.Overall, Justus Ranvier's contributions and concerns regarding the BIP proposal and the implementation of "No-Collision Mode" were discussed, with Alan Reiner requesting a recap/link to include Justus's work.</p>
