    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Brian Hoffman and Jeff Garzik, they discuss the value of in-person vetting of identity in establishing trust. Hoffman argues that the link between an online identity and a real-world identity is important to establish trust, citing the vetting process before issuance as valuable. Garzik counters by stating that the value of in-person vetting of identity is deniable, using the example of Satoshi to illustrate his point. Garzik believes that the relevant fingerprint is the online entity known as Satoshi and that PGP WoT is useless and stupid geek wanking. He argues that a person's behavioural signature is what is relevant and that governmental ID can be forged or present a different individual from that who is online. Garzik concludes that the currency of Bitcoin development is code and electronic messages describing cryptographic theses.</p>
