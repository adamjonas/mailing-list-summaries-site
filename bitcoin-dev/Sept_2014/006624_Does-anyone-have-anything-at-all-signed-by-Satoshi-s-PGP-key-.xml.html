    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list discussion on the possibility of email servers replacing public keys, one participant points out that publicly archived mailing lists make it impossible to get away with such acts without detection. Another participant references "The inmates are running the asylum," which suggests that solutions created by software engineers suffer from the flaw of absolutes, and argues that this applies to PGP and its various security measures. While PGP and GPG do include features like signatures and WoT, implementing these changes can turn off a significant portion of the audience. Ultimately, the author argues that an imperfect solution may be more valuable than a perfect one.</p>
