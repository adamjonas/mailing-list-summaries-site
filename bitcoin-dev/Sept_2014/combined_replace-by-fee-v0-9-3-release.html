        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on Bitcoin's development mailing list, Tom Harding raised the question of how nodes could verify double-spend alerts independently. Harding shared issue #4570 as an example, which relays the first double-spend as an alert. To further illustrate his point, Harding has been maintaining a real-time list of relayed double-spend transactions on <a href="http://respends.thinlink.com.Peter">http://respends.thinlink.com.Peter</a> Todd responded to Harding's query by mentioning that he recently ported his replace-by-fee branch to the v0.9.3 release. He added that this new version includes a scriptSig size limit increase, which introduces a new category of double-spending exploit. However, Todd noted that he would require at least another week before he could incorporate this exploit into his replace-by-fee toolkit.In response to Luke's question, there was no mention of a version compatible with CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent).</p>
