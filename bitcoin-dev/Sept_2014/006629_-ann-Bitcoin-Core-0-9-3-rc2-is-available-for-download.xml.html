    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Last weekend, a new version of Bitcoin's rc2 was uploaded to <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.3/test/">https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.3/test/</a>. This updated version includes some additional fixes to improve the network and memory behavior of Bitcoin.One of the changes that has been made is the removal of a useless millisleep in the socket handler. This will help to improve the overall efficiency of the network.Additionally, stricter memory limits have been placed on CNode, which will help to prevent any potential issues with memory usage. This change will help to ensure that the system runs smoothly and without any unnecessary hiccups.Furthermore, there have been improvements made to orphan transaction handling. This update includes the addition of `-maxorphantx=` and `-maxorphanblocks=` options, which will give users greater control over the maximum orphan counts.Overall, these updates aim to enhance the functionality and performance of Bitcoin's rc2, helping it to run more efficiently and effectively.</p>
