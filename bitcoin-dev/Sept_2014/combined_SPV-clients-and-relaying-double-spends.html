        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion in September 2014, Aaron Voisine suggested that nodes should relay double-spends to alert the network about such attempts. This would be beneficial for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients who cannot detect double-spends on their own. However, there was a concern about flooding the network with millions of spends of the same output(s), which could overwhelm slower connections. To prevent this, it was proposed that after two attempts to spend the same output, no further transactions spending that output should be relayed. Additionally, it was suggested that nodes should send reject messages, such as BIP61, to indicate which transactions they believe to be invalid but are still relaying. This would increase the cost of performing a 0 confirmation double spend attack on an SPV client. However, these measures could still be vulnerable to sybil attacks. The ongoing discussion can be found on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
