    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The WoT (Web of Trust) has been criticized for its in-person aspect, but dismissing it as "geek wanking" is unfair. The value of in-person identity vetting cannot be denied as many governmental clearances and credentials require it. A person's behavioral signature can also be relevant, but this does not apply to all situations, such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) which recommends in-person verification before trusting or signing a formerly-untrusted key. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, argues that the "online entity known as Satoshi" is the relevant fingerprint and can be easily established without any in-person meetings.</p>
