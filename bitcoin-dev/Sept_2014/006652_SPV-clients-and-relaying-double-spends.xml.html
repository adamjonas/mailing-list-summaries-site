    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list from September 25, 2014, users were considering how to prevent double-spend attacks. One suggestion was to relay warnings of double-spends rather than transactions after the first has already been attempted. This could potentially help SPV clients detect double-spends without overwhelming nodes with slower connections. However, this approach could be vulnerable to sybil attacks. Another user suggested that after two attempts to spend the same output, no further transactions spending that output should be relayed, in order to prevent flooding the network.</p>
