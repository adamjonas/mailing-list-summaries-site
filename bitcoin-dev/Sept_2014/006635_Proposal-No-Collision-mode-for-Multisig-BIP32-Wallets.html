    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent on September 23, 2014, Alan Reiner asked for suggestions to change the name "No-Collision Mode." Justus Ranvier responded that he would call it a "voting pool wallet" since that was the original application for this arrangement. He also expressed his desire for Reiner to mention their work since they had publicly documented it ever since they shared it with him back in January. Ranvier questioned whether the fact that they were implementing the idea in btcwallet made what they were working on unmentionable. The message included a PGP signature and an attachment of public key ID 0x38450DB5.</p>
