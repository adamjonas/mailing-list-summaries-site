    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation, a question was raised about whether a revealed private key for time-locked funds would create a race to spend, and it was suggested that miners with an advantage could still participate in this race. However, if Bitcoin had implemented RBF properly, then races could be won by bidding up the fees. It was noted that CSV using transactions are always RBF as CSV disables the opt-out. The conversation then shifted to the fact that RBF opt-out was hacked on top of `nSequence`, and relative timelocks were also hacked on top of `nSequence`. Finally, it was pointed out that coins locked on the main chain for the purpose of staking a sidechain have to be locked with an `OP_CSV`, which immediately enables protection.</p>
