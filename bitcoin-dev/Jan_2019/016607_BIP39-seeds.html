    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list continues regarding the use of real entropy versus fake sources of randomness, such as a book, for backup phrases. James MacWhyte suggests using text input unique methods for those who understand how these things work, including choosing X number of words from the start of the Nth sentence or combining two sentences from different pages. He believes that brute-forcing any of these methods would be nigh impossible and require hints/instructions from the owner to recover. However, he admits that discussing this topic on the mailing list may be unwarranted if it is not intended for standardization. The email also includes links to various tools and resources related to bitcoin transactions, Zcash wallets, and more.</p>
