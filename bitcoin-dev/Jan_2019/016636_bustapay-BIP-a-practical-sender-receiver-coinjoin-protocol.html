    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the potential issues that may arise for a "PayJoin-only" merchant who repeatedly uses a single UTXO over time. This could lead to an increasingly lopsided concentration of funds in the UTXO, which would eventually violate UIH2 (Unspent Output Coin Heuristic 2). One suggestion to avoid this issue is to have a mix of PayJoin and non-PayJoin transactions. The discussion also touches on bustapay, which allows for a PayJoin transaction with a merchant holding only a single UTXO. While technically not violating UIH2, repeated use of the same UTXO could still suggest such a naive PayJoin-only approach. Finally, a simple heuristic is proposed to choose when to PayJoin or not based on randomly flipping coins for each UTXO owned. However, no formal analysis of the blockchain has been conducted to support this idea.</p>
