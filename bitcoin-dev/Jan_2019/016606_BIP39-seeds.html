    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Alan Evans expressed concern about using fake sources of randomness, such as books, for generating BIP39 sentences, as it could make them vulnerable to hacking. He warned that if an algorithm for book text to BIP39 sentence became popular, common books would be systematically searched for accounts and collisions would occur because people would choose their favorite passages. However, he acknowledged that there are ways to make text inputs unique, such as choosing a specific number of words from a certain sentence or combining sentences from different pages, which would be difficult to brute force. Nonetheless, Alan admitted that discussing the topic on the mailing list might not be necessary if it is not intended for standardization.</p>
