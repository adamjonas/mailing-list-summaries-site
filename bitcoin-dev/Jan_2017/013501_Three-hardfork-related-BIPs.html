    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr proposed three hardfork-related BIPs. The first BIP addresses criticisms of SegWit and proposes a protocol change that would reduce the block size limit to a more sustainable size in the short-term and gradually increase it up over the long-term to 31 MB. The proposal also extends the witness discount to non-SegWit transactions and includes a hardfork, which requires community consensus before deployment. The second BIP is a preparatory change that allows certain classes of hardforks to be transformed into softforks in the future. The third BIP proposes an anti-replay softfork that prevents replay attacks induced by a hardfork-related chain split or in ordinary operation. Regarding the first BIP, Dashjr suggests that the growth factor of the block size limit should be soft forked if necessary, meaning that if the rate of increase exceeds what the technology can handle, a tighter limit will be imposed. This could work both ways, however, as the rate could also potentially be increased. Dashjr notes that this proposal does not interfere with another more aggressive block size increase hardfork that might be proposed in the meantime. Dashjr recommends immediate adoption of the first BIP, but welcomes peer and community review for suggested changes. The text and code for all three BIPs are available on GitHub.</p>
