    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing various features for a possible hard fork. One of the proposals discussed was the removal of the block size limit, although it was generally agreed that some form of limit was necessary to encourage spending of UTXO and limiting creation of UTXO. The SigOp limit is also unlikely to be hit unless using a very big multi-sig.A proposed second version of bitcoin's hardfork, called forcenet2, has been suggested by Johnson Lau. The main features include a secondary header, anti-replay, SigHash limit for old scripts and new tx weight accounting. Additional optional features are also mentioned such as the smooth halving, new coinbase format and Mekle sum tree.Matt Corallo commented on forcenet2 with suggestions to minimize header size, have only one merkle tree for transactions and avoid variable-length header fields. There was also discussion regarding light wallet functionality without upgrade and Stratum protocol. Lastly, there were comments about the complexity of the tx weight accounting and how it may impact coin selection.During the discussions, a new coinbase transaction format was proposed to allow signing an input to be part of a coinbase TX but limited to a particular previous block hash. Merkle sum tree was also proposed to enable generating fraud-proof for fee and weight, but it would require a backdoor to disable. Overall, the mailing list concluded that some of these proposals were not essential for the hard fork and could be added later through a soft fork.</p>
