        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of a script wiki is questioning whether multiple pushdatas in op_return would be considered standard. Although the code does not explicitly state that only one pushdata is allowed, the script wiki may not be up to date. The policy.cpp file on Github does not seem to limit the number of pushdatas allowed in op_return. A user named Chris asked if there would be any objections to making op_return outputs with two pushdatas standard, with the same maximum data size. In response, Luke Dashjr stated that standards (BIPs) should describe a specific use case and protocol for implementing such outputs. He also mentioned that most nodes have a default policy that allows them.On January 9, 2017, Chris proposed a question about standardizing op_return outputs with two pushdatas. Luke responded that BIPs should provide a specific use case and protocol for implementation, and most nodes already allow such outputs by default.The proposal aims to make op_return outputs with two pushdatas standard, with the same maximum data size. This is intended to facilitate tagging transactions so they can be returned by bloom filtering nodes. By using the op_return output script, transactions can be easily fetched if their tag matches a specific pattern. It seems that a significant number of nodes and miners already accept such transactions, as the first block was mined using this method.</p>
