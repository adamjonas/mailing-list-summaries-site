    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of full nodes publishing proofs of invalid blocks has proven impossible, according to a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. While Satoshi had envisioned a system in which SPV nodes would automatically verify these proofs and maintain full node security, there is no viable theory on how to implement this. As a result, running true full nodes remains the only way to achieve full-node-security, making the concept of only having full nodes in data centers unrealistic without centralising Bitcoin.One alternative solution suggested was validity challenges, where someone makes a claim that part of a block is invalid, and failure to meet the challenge with proof that rules are followed is considered evidence of fraud. However, validity challenges do not scale well and pose DoS attack issues, while also failing to solve censorship. Additionally, if the few remaining nodes were all located in large data centers, they could be easily forced to follow AML/KYC rules.</p>
