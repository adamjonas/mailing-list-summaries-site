    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of whether a maximum block size limit should be included in the protocol was raised. Tom Zander suggested that a simple policy set by node operators to reject blocks larger than a certain size would solve the issue. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed, stating that rejecting a block based on a condition is part of the consensus protocol and not just a policy. He argued that the protocol is the set of rules that determine the validity of blocks. Dashjr's definition of the protocol as the set of rules by which blocks are determined to be valid or invalid means that policies can vary from node to node without affecting the validity judgement of blocks. This means an individual node can reject technically valid blocks if they find them unacceptable. The implications of this when applied to many nodes have been pondered by many people and considered intriguing.</p>
