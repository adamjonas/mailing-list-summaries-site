    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the context created a second version of forcenet, which has new experimental features and stopped the forcenet1 node. The new version has a new header format with various fields like Height, BIP9 signalling field, hardfork signalling field, Hash TMR, Hash WMR, Merkle sum root, number of tx, prev hash, timestamp, nBits, nonce1, nonce2, and more. Additionally, it also has anti-tx-replay feature, where signatures are invalid for legacy nodes if the tx nVersion is >=3, but they won’t be relayed nor validated by legacy nodes due to being non-std. This also removes the O(n^2) sighash problem when spending non-segwit outputs.Moreover, the new version also has Block sighashlimit, where SigHashSize is counted only for legacy non-segwit inputs. The author provides a connection link to the node running at 8333.info with the default port (39901). There is only basic internal mining support available, and to use the internal miner, one needs to write up a shell script to repeatedly call "bitcoin-cli —forcenet generate 1". The author mentions that the anti-replay is a long story and will discuss it in a separate post/BIP.</p>
