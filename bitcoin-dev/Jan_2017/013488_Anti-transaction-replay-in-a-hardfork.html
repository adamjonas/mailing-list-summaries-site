    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Johnson Lau and Chris Priest discusses the potential for a hard fork to create two incompatible ledgers. However, it is noted that the BIP50 hard fork did not result in incompatible ledgers due to the replay effect. Priest suggests creating a "bridge" that replays all transactions from one network over to the other to prevent confusion for end-users. The goal should be unity rather than permanent division. A pre-BIP proposal is then discussed regarding anti-replay options for users on both existing and new forks, as well as a change to the SignatureHash algorithm. Limitations are also noted, including the inability to protect transactions made before the proposal and the need for hardfork proposals to take into account the harmful effects of replay attacks.</p>
