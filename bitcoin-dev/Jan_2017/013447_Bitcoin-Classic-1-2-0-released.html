    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Classic has released version 1.2.0, which includes new features, bug fixes and performance improvements. The most visible change is the decentralised block size solution where node operators decide on the maximum size. Bitcoin Classic only activates if 75% of the network adopts it. Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev raised concerns about the release announcement that doesn't make it clear that Bitcoin Classic is incompatible with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. Lombrozo also criticized the lack of BIP for the hard fork, no evidence of community-wide consensus and the lack of release notes in the GitHub repository. Tom Zander, via the same mailing list, stated that Bitcoin Classic is focused on providing users a way to get onto the Bitcoin network using a high-quality validating node for a large set of use cases. Classic presents top-notch quality processes in this release, to help anyone running Bitcoin. Zander also provided a link to the full release notes on GitHub and further information on the release.</p>
