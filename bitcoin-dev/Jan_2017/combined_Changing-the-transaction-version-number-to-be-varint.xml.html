        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Tom Zander proposed a change to the Bitcoin transaction format, suggesting that bytes 2, 3, and 4 be labeled as unused from a certain block height and that the first byte be interpreted as varint from the same block height. He also suggested adding a rule that only transactions not lying about their version number would be valid, meaning version 1. This could be done through a soft fork. However, it was pointed out that this would be a hardfork as existing nodes would not be able to deserialize the transaction and interpret the first 4 bytes as nVersion. Additionally, using non-version 1 transactions is allowed since v0.1, and changing the tx serialization only affects network transfer, making it a p2p protocol upgrade. The proposal could introduce new tx formats in one of three ways: softfork, hardfork, or p2p only, which would have no impact on consensus.</p>
