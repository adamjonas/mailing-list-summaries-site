    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent email exchange between members of the Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin-dev mailing lists has highlighted concerns over the clarity and safety of the former's latest release. Eric Lombrozo, a member of bitcoin-dev, accused the Classic version of being "dangerous and irresponsible," due to its incompatibility with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. The release notes also lacked detail about changes made to the code, which makes it difficult for average users to know what is under the hood or what has changed and time consuming for developers to assess. Tom Zander of Bitcoin Classic responded by saying that the company only activates if 75% of the miners adopt it, but Lombrozo retorted that this would be easier to achieve through politicking, bribery, coercion and other tomfoolery as 75% of the hashrate is ultimately only a dozen people or so.</p>
