        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Block75 is a proposal that aims to change the maximum block sizes in such a way that it facilitates growth, keeps blocks as small as possible and maintains transaction fees similar to May/June 2016. The proposal uses the past year's daily average block size and last year's growth rate to estimate how the max block size one year from now would be affected if Block75 was activated today. According to the model, the current maximum block size would be 1,135KB, while it would increase to 2,064KB one year from now.The proposal makes use of an algorithm that calculates the new maximum block size by adding x to x multiplied by the difference between the average percentage full of the last 2016 blocks, as a decimal, and Block75's target of keeping blocks 75% full. This calculation is done every 2016 blocks. Although this is just an estimate, even considering the substantial increase in transactions in the last quarter of 2017 and changes brought about by SegWit activation, Block75 is expected to alter the max size in a way that allows for growth and keeps transaction fees manageable.The author of the proposal invites anyone with an alternate way to model future behavior to run it through the Block75 algorithm. Overall, Block75 is a promising proposal that seeks to address the issue of growing block sizes while ensuring that transaction fees remain reasonable.</p>
