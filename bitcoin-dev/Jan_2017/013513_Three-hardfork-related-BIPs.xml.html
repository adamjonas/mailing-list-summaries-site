    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Andrew Johnson expressed his concerns about the proposed 66% decrease in block size limit, stating that it seems "completely out of touch with reality." However, it is argued that serious action needs to be taken to ensure that a supermajority of economic activity is verified using full nodes. Currently, only 10% of economic activity uses full nodes for verification. While Satoshi envisioned most full nodes running in data centers in the white paper, it has proven impossible to achieve this vision without centralizing Bitcoin. The proposal for a decrease in block size limit aims to encourage the use of full nodes, but some argue that it may not be enough to solve the problem.</p>
