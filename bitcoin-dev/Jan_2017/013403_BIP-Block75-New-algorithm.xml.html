    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tom Zander and an unknown recipient, the question was raised on how math could have created something that was completely free and human created. Zander responds by stating that everything in Bitcoin is math, except for the blocksize limit which was a temporary solution at the time. When the recipient suggested that a simple policy set by node operators would suffice to solve the issue of block size, Zander disagreed, stating that there is no such thing as a "simple policy" when humans are involved and that different nodes would have different opinions on the matter, leading to a potential disaster.</p>
