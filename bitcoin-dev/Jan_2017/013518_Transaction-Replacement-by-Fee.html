    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The user in this context has been attempting to get RBF (Replace-By-Fee) working on a multisig input. They set the nSequence to 0, but the script failed to verify when using python-bitcoinlib. The user is using the SignatureHash(...) method of signing and not rpc.signrawtransaction(...). BIP125 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) is mentioned as the standard way to signal. A link to BIP125 is provided for further information. Additionally, some miners mine full replace-by-fee, which has no limitations on nSequence. Peter Todd's implementation (for v0.13.2) can be found on Github, which is identical to Bitcoin Core modulo the nSequence stuff being removed, and a special service bit added to allow full-rbf nodes to preferentially peer with each other to make sure replacement transactions get propagated.It is noted that in practice full-RBF works fairly well, so while it is even faster to use the nSequence signalling specified in BIP-125, doing so is not mandatory so long as you can get your replacement transaction to a full-RBF node. Contact information for Peter Todd is also provided.</p>
