    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion started with Peter Todd's comment that a world of nodes in large data centers would make it easy to force the remaining Bitcoin nodes to follow AML/KYC rules. Tom Harding agreed with this statement and pointed out that just because such an attack hasn't occurred yet, doesn't mean the vulnerability doesn't exist. He added that this is a trivial exploit and will happen when there is enough economic incentive. Moreover, he noted that similar attacks on other points of centralization are already happening. The conversation also mentioned that it would be comparatively easy to require AML/KYC for mining pools.</p>
