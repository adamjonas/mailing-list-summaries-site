    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 2, 2017, Steve Davis posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list asking about a potential attack vector using a specific pk_script. Jeremy Rubin responded, stating that the script could not do much, and that the worst it could do would be to use up approximately 10 MB of memory. Johnson Lau added that there could only be up to 201 opcodes in a script, and that the maximum size for OP_CAT was 520 bytes. On January 3, 2017, Rubin again responded, saying that the elements alpha proposal to reenable a limited op_cat to 520 bytes was controversial. Russell O'Connor then posted on January 4, 2017, stating that Satoshi had added the OP_CAT limit of 520 bytes on August 15, 2010, at the same time that OP_CAT was disabled; the previous limit was 5000 bytes.</p>
