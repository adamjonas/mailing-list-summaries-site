    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion, Chris Priest argues that Bitcoin Classic's block format change only affects miners, not nodes or wallets. He contrasts this with SegWit, which requires everyone to write code to support the new transaction format. However, another participant points out that this is what makes a decentralized system; when everyone is affected. Priest also argues that it doesn't matter if 75% of hashpower is controlled by a few people since that is how the system works. However, someone else notes that this is an obvious weakness of the system. Additionally, Priest's comment about "just a node" is criticized as unfair. Finally, a participant questions why there are so many full nodes and what would happen if someone controlled a majority of them. Links to various GitHub pages are provided at the end.</p>
