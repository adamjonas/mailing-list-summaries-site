    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent on July 1st, 2017, Eric Lombrozo via bitcoin-dev criticized the release announcement of Bitcoin Classic, stating that it was not made clear that the software is incompatible with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. He further noted that the version constitutes a hard fork on the mainnet without a safe activation and includes other unsafe changes, as well as the absence of a BIP for the hard fork and evidence of community-wide consensus for such an event. However, some have pointed out that Bitcoin Core has also implemented two hard forks since November 2015 without activation or prior public debate, although there were internal discussions about whether a BIP should document the latter. Nonetheless, if the threshold criteria is a hard fork, Bitcoin Core has not met it.</p>
