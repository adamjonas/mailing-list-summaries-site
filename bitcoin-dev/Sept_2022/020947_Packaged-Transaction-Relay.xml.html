    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Eric and alicexbt discusses various aspects of Bitcoin transactions. Matt Corallo's concern regarding pre-signed transactions with low fee rate is highlighted in the discussion. The example provided shows that PSBTs with higher fee rates get confirmed faster than those with lower fee rates. The relevance of node configuration is discussed, and it is concluded that it is not significant. The implications of CPFP fee-bumping are also mentioned, and it is suggested that the complexity of the proposed solutions may not be justified for such scenarios. The dominance of Bitcoin Core in node implementation is noted, but its relevance to protocol consideration is debated. The importance of miners selecting the most optimal set of transactions is acknowledged, but it is also stated that miners could affect the security of some Bitcoin projects with MEV. Finally, it is agreed that any policy beyond what is published via the protocol will cause problems.</p>
