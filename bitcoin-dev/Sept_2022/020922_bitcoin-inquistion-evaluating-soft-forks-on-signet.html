    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread on bitcoin-dev, the topic of "how to successfully get soft fork ideas from concept to deployment" came up. The discussion was prompted by the failed CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY activation earlier this year. While some people think there is no good answer to this question, Matt strongly disagrees. He believes that the process can be broken down into four steps: coming up with an idea, socializing it within the technical community, proposing a concrete idea and getting feedback, and finally finding champions who are willing to push the idea towards rough agreement among technical Bitcoiners. The main issue today, according to Matt, is a lack of people following these steps. Once there are more champions willing to push ideas forward, step four (dealing with less defined issues) can be addressed.</p>
