    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 11th, an online Socratic was held with Tim Ruffing and Elizabeth Crites to discuss various topics related to MuSig(2), FROST, ROAST, and more. The transcript and video of the session are available on btctranscripts.com and YouTube, respectively. A reading list has also been compiled, which includes resources on MuSig(2), FROST, and ROAST. During the discussion, the participants covered a range of topics such as BIP340, handling x-only public keys in MuSig2, the proposed TLUV covenant opcode, the history of MuSig from its initial broken version to MuSig2, how MuSig2 and FROST compare for multisig schemes, why MuSig2 doesn't use proofs of possession, and the current state of the draft MuSig2 BIP. Although the session was long (~2.5 hours), it provided valuable insights into these topics, and the transcript or video can be useful for those interested in any of the above topics. Jonas Nick recently tweeted that the MuSig2 BIP is approaching a stable version 1.0, which should be helpful for those using it in the wild. Links to all relevant sources have been provided.</p>
