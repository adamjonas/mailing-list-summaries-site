        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ali Sherief reached out to Michael Folkson regarding the Socratic transcript, which touched on various issues including theft and online connectivity. Ali inquired if there was any research done that didn't involve a trade-off of theft or online connectivity. Michael explained that generating a signature requires private keys and has concerns regarding security and theft. However, multisig arrangements are better than no multisig arrangement as they prevent loss of funds due to theft of a single private key.During the discussion at the online Socratic held on August 11th, Tim Ruffing and Elizabeth Crites covered various topics related to MuSig(2), FROST, ROAST, and more. The transcript and video of the session are available on btctranscripts.com and YouTube, respectively. They discussed a range of topics such as BIP340, handling x-only public keys in MuSig2, the proposed TLUV covenant opcode, the history of MuSig from its initial broken version to MuSig2, how MuSig2 and FROST compare for multisig schemes, why MuSig2 doesn't use proofs of possession, and the current state of the draft MuSig2 BIP.Michael also clarified that in the realm of generating signatures, there isn't really a concept of a "lite node", but it makes more sense in the realm of verification. In the case of Liquid, there is an 11-of-15 threshold signature arrangement where currently 11 signatures go onchain when funds are moved but if Liquid used a key aggregation scheme like FROST only a single signature would need to go onchain. Increasing the 11-of-15 to say a 22-of-30 is possible or having a nested MuSig/FROST scheme behind one of the 11 signers of the 11-of-15 is another option. Ultimately, you are either generating a signature that contributes to the moving of funds or you aren't. If you aren't generating a signature then you are just verifying the signature(s) that go onchain like all other full nodes on the network.The MuSig2 BIP is approaching a stable version 1.0, which should be helpful for those using it in the wild. A reading list has also been compiled, which includes resources on MuSig(2), FROST, and ROAST. All relevant sources have been provided for those interested in any of the discussed topics.</p>
