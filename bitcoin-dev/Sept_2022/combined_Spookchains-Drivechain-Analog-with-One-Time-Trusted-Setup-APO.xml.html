        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article explores the concept of Terminal States/Thresholds in blockchain technology and how they represent accumulated work over a period. The author suggests sending the money to an OP_TRUE output to prevent miners from swerving the car to a different output. To address double-spending issues, covenant-based drivechain designs and recursive-covenant "embedded" sidechains are discussed. For handling arbitrary deposits or withdrawals, the protocol can be instantiated for every amount or divided using base 2 or another base, with splitting and joining accomplished by pre-signing. Various ways to improve trust assumptions in blockchain transactions are suggested, including MuSig Multi-Party, Unaggregated Multi-Party, and Soft Forking Away Trust.The article also discusses a covenant model for creating drivechains with recursive covenants using ANYPREVOUT and a trusted setup ceremony. The covenant is defined as a set of sets of transaction intents, potentially recursive or co-recursive, and a verifier generator function that generates a function that accepts an intent that is any element of one member of the family of intents and a proof for it and rejects others. The covenant is verified under certain assumptions, including multi-sig covenant with at least 1-n honesty, Sha256 collision resistance, Discrete Log Hardness, and a SGX module being correct.To handle arbitrary deposits or withdrawals, the protocol can be instantiated for every amount or divided using base 2 or another base. Splitting and joining can also be accomplished by pre-signing. The article evaluates a covenant under a set of assumptions and analyzes how it can be composed. The Peano counter graph is used in this process to build a simple 1 to 5 counter that has an inc/dec feature, using a key instead of sha-256. All signatures set the input sequence to one block to enforce that only one vote per block is allowed.When a counter reaches the Nth state, there should be some viable state transition at this point, such as sending the money to an OP_TRUE output that the miner incrementing that state is responsible for following the rules of the spookchain. From any K^i_1 state, the transaction transitioning to K^i_2 can be treated as “special,” and the OP_RETURN output type can be used to commit to the outputs that must be created when the Terminal State is reached. Instead of using randomly generated keys for each state, xpubs can be defined and derived for each state/satoshi amount. A single party pre-signs all transactions for the spookchain, and then deletes their xpriv.Lastly, the article discusses the advantages of using symmetry of state transition rules and DAG covenants. Composability is possible, as the Terminal State can pay out into a pre-specified covenant from any other family of covenants.</p>
