    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 13, 2022, Ryan Grant via bitcoin-dev initiated a discussion on defining a communication channel for the Bitcoin community to develop and resist "Tyranny of Structurelessness" without resorting to formalized governance processes and systems. The options included IRC, Slack, Discord, and Discourse, among others. Buck O Perley supported the idea and suggested that publishing logs could counter concerns of exclusivity but voted against Slack, while Ryan agreed that anything requiring a phone number makes it difficult to be pseudonymous. They both agreed that IRC remains the lowest bar for participants to contribute. However, Ryan recommended Matrix as it doesn't require any privacy invasive information and has end-to-end encryption by default for one-on-one conversations. The Matrix room could optionally bridge to IRC if there is significant demand for that.</p>
