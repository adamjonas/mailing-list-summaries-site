    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Craig Raw proposed a BIP that specifies a format for the export and import of labels from a wallet. He states that while transferring access to funds across wallet applications has been made simple through standards such as BIP39, wallet labels remain siloed and difficult to extract despite their value, particularly in a privacy context. The proposed format is a simple two-column CSV file with the reference to a transaction, address, input or output in the first column and the label in the second column. CSV was chosen for its wide accessibility, especially to users without specific technical expertise. The full text of the BIP can be found at <a href="https://github.com/craigraw/bips/blob/master/bip-wallet-labels.mediawiki.He">https://github.com/craigraw/bips/blob/master/bip-wallet-labels.mediawiki.He</a> concludes by saying that following discussions with several wallet developers, he has come to the conclusion that the secondary goal of managing labels in non-specialized applications must be sacrificed to achieve the primary goal of wide implementation across different wallets. As such, he has rewritten the specification to use JSON, specifically the JSON Lines format suggested by Ryan Havar and others. Public keys and xpubs have been added as types following further suggestions, and compression and encryption have been removed to keep the specification simple. The rewritten BIP can be found at <a href="https://github.com/craigraw/bips/blob/master/bip-wallet-labels.mediawiki">https://github.com/craigraw/bips/blob/master/bip-wallet-labels.mediawiki</a>. Feedback is always appreciated.</p>
