    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The 3rd Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG) meeting has been proposed for Tuesday, January 17th at 18:00 UTC. The agenda will include a review of the previous meeting's agenda and go over all contracting protocol and use-cases to ensure that there is exhaustivity in the R&D effort with respect to known ideas issued by the community. Anyone who has been working on a use-case that is missing from the current listing is invited to open a PR or contact the group leader.During the second part of the meeting, participants will have time to discuss any blockers they have encountered in their contracting primitives/covenant research. One of the personal goals for the coming year is to nurture some websites with archive material gathered progressively in the repository. These websites would present the contracting protocol research according to the best engineering/scientific standards and ensure idea neutrality. It would also enable collection of feedback on dimensions such as privacy or economic scaling from the Bitcoin community of stakeholders at large, with Pretty Graphics (tm).In pursuit of a "decentralized" spirit, the group plans to start rotating meetings host during the year. If anyone is interested in hosting one of the monthly meetings, they are encouraged to open an issue against the repository or contact the group leader. Communication venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat. Logs of the previous session are available here [0]. Anyone with questions or feedback is invited to reach out to Antoine, the group leader.</p>
