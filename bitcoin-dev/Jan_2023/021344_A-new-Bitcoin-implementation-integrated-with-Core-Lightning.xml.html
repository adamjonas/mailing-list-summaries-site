    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email is discussing the idea of creating a Knots style Bitcoin implementation in C++ integrated with Core Lightning in C. This would avoid re-implementing consensus code in a different language, which is why many believe it to be a better option than other alternatives. The dysfunction in the Bitcoin Core project has made the author take this idea more seriously. They feel the current management of the project is not how an open-source project should be managed and that very little discussion is public anymore. The author thinks that a bare bones Bitcoin and Lightning implementation integrated into one codebase would be beneficial. They mention the libbitcoinkernel project as an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core, but it seems like a consensus-compatible codebase fork of Bitcoin Core such as Knots is still the best model. The author also discusses the mixing of C and C++ code and whether it makes sense to do so. The author floats this idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases.</p>
