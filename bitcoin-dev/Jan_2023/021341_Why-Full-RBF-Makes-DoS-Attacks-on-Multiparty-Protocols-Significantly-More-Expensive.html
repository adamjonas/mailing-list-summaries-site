    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named alicexbt brought up the topic of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) and how it affects different coinjoin implementations. Peter Todd responded by stating that Samourai Wallet's technical decisions are "insane" at best and likely malicious with their xpub collection. He also criticized Wasabi for their privacy issues, including address reuse and consolidation in a coinjoin transaction. The debate shifted to Samourai's reputation after supposedly deciding to work with chain analysis firms for censorship of some UTXOs. However, there was no citation on this claim, and the blacklisting was deemed symbolic and not a significant issue. Ultimately, the discussion highlighted concerns over privacy and censorship in the Bitcoin community.</p>
