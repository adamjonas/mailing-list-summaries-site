    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The comparison between SIGHASH_GROUP and Ephemeral anchors is an interesting topic. SIGHASH_GROUP allows inputs to divide outputs into non-overlapping groups. This means that a signature can link set of inputs and outputs via a signature in a way that's more general than SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, SIGHASH_SINGLE, and SIGHASH_ALL. On the other hand, Ephemeral anchors are a policy level rule that a transaction may create a single 0-value output with sPK of OP_TRUE, which won't be rejected as being dust. To some extent, ephemeral anchors provide an alternative way of getting the same benefits of SIGHASH_GROUP. The detailed proposed rules for Ephemeral anchors state that the transaction must have one or more CScript([OP_2]) output and must be 0-fee while having the ephemeral anchor output spent in the same mempool relay package. It must also have nversion==3, and it cannot have more than one such output.However, ephemeral anchors aren't a complete replacement for SIGHASH_GROUP. If i1 had two signatures, one signing with SIGHASH_GROUP but the other signing with SIGHASH_ALL, then it's difficult to duplicate that behavior exactly with ephemeral anchors. Additionally, if the value of i1+i2+i3 was less than o1 or i4 was less than o2+o3, then the introduction of f is too late to compensate for that with ephemeral anchors, but would have been fine with SIGHASH_GROUP.In theory, Ephemeral anchors get most of the potential benefits of SIGHASH_GROUP, particularly if the (v3.4b) rule can be removed or loosened somehow. And it's obviously much less costly to implement: it's relay policy only, rather than a consensus change; and it only operates at the transaction level, so we don't have to start worrying about pinning of inputs vs whole transactions.</p>
