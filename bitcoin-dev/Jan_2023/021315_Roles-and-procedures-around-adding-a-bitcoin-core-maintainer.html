    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, a user named alicexbt is proposing some ideas to improve the process of adding maintainers to Bitcoin Core. She provides a list of present core maintainers along with the last two developers that stepped down from the position. She also details the process followed in adding the last maintainer and the initiatives taken to improve the process and documentation. Furthermore, she discusses the process being followed for adding vasild as a new maintainer and the disagreements faced during the pull request. Alicexbt proposes some changes that could improve the process, such as opening a 'Call for Maintainers' issue if contributors or maintainers need a new maintainer, discussing nominated contributors in an IRC meeting where everyone can share their opinion, allowing ACK/NACKs for pull requests, and encouraging long term contributors who are not living in first world countries. She also suggests that self-merging pull requests should be avoided and the scope for present and new maintainers should be defined. In response, Michael Folkson acknowledges the confusion and says he will look into it offline to resolve the issue without unnecessary drama. He appreciates transparency and documentation but believes ranting and raving on the mailing list is not productive. He wishes happy holidays and signs off with his contact information.</p>
