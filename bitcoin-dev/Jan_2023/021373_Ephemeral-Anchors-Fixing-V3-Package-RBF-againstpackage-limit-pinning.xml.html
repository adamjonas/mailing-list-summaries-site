    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Greg Sanders has proposed an idea called Ephemeral Anchors, which he implemented on top of the V3 proposal. He wrote a short draft BIP for it, but the current pull request is unaffected. In his previous email, Greg had mentioned that there were no solid noninteractive ideas unless they get some flexible sighash softfork. Collaborative fee bumps can be obtained interactively under the current consensus regime and ephemeral anchors. Jeremy Rubin appreciated Greg's proposal and said that it captures much of the spirit of sponsors with respect to how they might be used for V3 protocols.V3 transactions may solve bip125 rule#3 and rule#5 pinning attacks under some constraints, but the problem of package limit pinning still exists. Greg proposed two solutions - a carveout for "sibling eviction" or using Ephemeral Anchors. He explained the implications of the latter, including allowing any value without worrying about bloating the utxo set, directly double-spending prior spends of the ephemeral anchor, anyone being able to bump the transaction without any transaction key material, superseding lightning carve-out, and benefiting more traditional wallet scenarios. However, there are open questions regarding MEV and SIGHASH_GROUP constructs.A discussion was held on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding V3 transactions and their veto power over all inputs in that transaction. It was noted that this solution is not enough to fix issues with ANYONECANPAY. A more complex solution was suggested, but was put off for the sake of progress. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is maintained by the Linux Foundation.</p>
