        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG) has proposed the third meeting to be held on Tuesday, January 17th at 18:00 UTC. The agenda for the meeting includes a review of the previous meeting's agenda, discussing all contracting protocol use-cases, and reviewing research in the contracting primitives/covenant spaces. Participants are encouraged to open a PR or contact Antoine if they have been working on a use-case that is missing from the current listing. During the second part of the meeting, participants will have time to discuss any blockers they have encountered in their contracting primitives/covenant research. Antoine Riard, the group leader, has set a personal goal for the year to nurture websites with archive material gathered progressively in the repository. These sites would present the contracting protocol research according to the best engineering/scientific standards, ensure idea neutrality, and collect feedback on dimensions such as privacy or economic scaling from the Bitcoin community of stakeholders at large, with Pretty Graphics (tm). In pursuit of a "decentralized" spirit, the group plans to start rotating meetings host during the year. If anyone is interested in hosting one of the monthly meetings, they are encouraged to open an issue against the repository or contact the group leader.Communication venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and logs of previous sessions are available here [0]. Participants are welcome to reach out to Antoine if they have any questions or feedback.</p>
