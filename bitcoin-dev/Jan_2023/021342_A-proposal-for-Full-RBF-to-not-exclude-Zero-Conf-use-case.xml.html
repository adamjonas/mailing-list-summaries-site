    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Daniel Lipshitz, co-founder of GAP600, explained that his company is not a transaction processor or liquidity provider but instead provides 0-conf enabling services to merchants, payment processors and non-custodial liquidity providers. Clients access their service via API and send them the trx hash and output address. Lipshitz added that GAP600's service is purely an analysis of the Bitcoin network and is not based on AML/KYC. However, a user pointed out that by collecting name, phone number, email and company name for sign-up, GAP600 is engaging in AML/KYC which could lead to privacy concerns. The user also suggested that full RBF should be implemented to stop the collection of sensitive data. When asked about other companies using GAP600's service, Lipshitz refused to name any of them. Another user argued that adding a limitation to full-RBF would negate its usefulness in multi-party transactions and make DoS attacks on multiparty protocols more expensive.</p>
