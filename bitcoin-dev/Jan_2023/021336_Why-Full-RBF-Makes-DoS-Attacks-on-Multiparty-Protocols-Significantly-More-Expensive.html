    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This email from Peter Todd to an unknown recipient discusses the benefits of full Replace-by-Fee (full-rbf) in multi-party protocols like coinjoins, despite concerns that it would increase the likelihood of double-spending attacks. The email explains that without full-rbf, low-fee transactions can indefinitely hold up multi-party transactions by intentionally or unintentionally double-spending inputs. Full-rbf mitigates this issue by allowing higher fee transactions to replace lower fee transactions, ensuring forward progress. However, attackers may still exploit transaction pinning rules to make fee-bumping more difficult and costly. Exploiting either rule is expensive, as attackers must broadcast more fee-paying transactions than they otherwise would have, but it is still a possibility. Despite these concerns, full-rbf clearly offers improvements for multi-party protocols, among other reasons to adopt it. The email provides detailed footnotes and examples to support its claims.</p>
