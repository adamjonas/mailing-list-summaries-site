    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev forum, Peter Todd raised concerns over the risks of halving to the system. He pointed out that a sudden shock to the system could result in significant hashing power being shut down and fees increasing dramatically, leading to chaos. The proposal presented by Alfie John did not address this issue. When questioned about whether halving was a foreseeable event, Todd explained that there was no mechanism to price it in when it came to hashing power. He also stated that sufficient fee increases to bring back hashing power would cause enormous disruption to many things, including Lightning channels.</p>
