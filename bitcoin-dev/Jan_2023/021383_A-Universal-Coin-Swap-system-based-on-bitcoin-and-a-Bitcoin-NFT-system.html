    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is expressing confusion about the current discussion on ordinals and explains that they do not support storing things in witness or using ordinals as an NFT system. They clarify that NFTs are not just electronic things, but can also be physical objects referenced in the blockchain by a double hash. The author believes that Bitcoin is currently out of the future web3 and that Lightning will not solve everything. The author proposes two solutions - a Bitcoin NFT system and a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin. They aim to propose something simple, secure, decentralized, easy to implement and use, and not expensive for users. The proposals aim to store real proof in OP_RETURN without flooding the Bitcoin network with irrelevant data. The trust in the proposals is more based on a reputation model, and the cheater risks losing their Bitcoin or being tagged as a cheater.The author sees Lightning as a middle/long-term relationship between people, while their proposals are aimed at one-time deals, which may involve buying something else from the seller with a different coin in a different location (such as metaverse). The author claims their proposals are non-inventive but include unusual ideas like the double hash and third-party. The proposals facilitate the selling of secret NFTs and remain decentralized, unlike existing tools or wallets. The author invites review and feedback on their proposals. They provide links to their CV, LinkedIn profile, GitHub, wallet, and other projects like bitcoin-transactions, torrent-live, node-Tor, dynamic blocklist, and Peersm. The author argues that Bitcoin is better than other systems in all aspects.</p>
