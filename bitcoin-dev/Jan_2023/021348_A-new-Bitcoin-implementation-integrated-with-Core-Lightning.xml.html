    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Folkson, a contributor in the Bitcoin Core project and the Lightning Network, is considering forking Bitcoin Core and integrating it with Core Lightning. He believes that this would be an ambitious and exciting project that could attract more contributors. Michael also thinks that Bitcoin Core has collected a lot of cruft over time and that the ultra-conservatism needed when treating consensus code seems to permeate into parts of the codebase that no one is using. He mentioned that the libbitcoinkernel project was an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core but it seems like it won't achieve that as consensus is just too slippery a concept. Michael shared his idea on the lightning-dev mailing list and asked for feedback from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. He also mentioned that Rusty, a well-known Bitcoin developer, said on a podcast that if he had another life he'd have liked to work on Core. Michael plans to see whether the Core Lightning contributors might be interested in helping out on this project. In response to Michael's email, alicexbt suggested that if they were to fork Bitcoin Core and maintain an implementation, they wouldn't integrate any Lightning implementation with it. Instead, they would remove some things from Bitcoin Core and keep it simple. They also shared a link to a branch with interesting commits if Michael is looking to remove things from Bitcoin Core and maintain an implementation with no GUI, wallet, less RPCs, etc.</p>
