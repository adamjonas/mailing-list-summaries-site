    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Twitter, a user named alicexbt asked how to get extra sats to increase fees for Coinjoin transactions. However, Peter Todd clarified that there is no need for extra sats as Coinjoin transactions already have fees set at a level at which they would expect to be mined in a reasonable amount of time. Full-RBF ensures that either the Coinjoin gets mined or any double-spend has to have a high enough feerate that it will be mined in a reasonable amount of time as well. Todd dismissed the mention of Whirlpool, stating that Samourai has made some rather insane technical decisions and their opinion isn't relevant. Wasabi plans to make Coinjoins opt-in to RBF, but it may take some time due to technical reasons. Attackers can already perform DoS attacks by double-spending their inputs in Coinjoin so this is not an effective attack, according to Todd. He also said that the tweet mentioned in the discussion was simply false.</p>
