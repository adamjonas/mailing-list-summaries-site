    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses how Full-RBF mitigates the double-spend DoS attack in a straightforward way, with coinjoin transactions already having fees set at a level where they can be mined within a reasonable amount of time. The email sender also talks about using various implementations of coinjoin such as Wasabi, Samourai, Joinmarket, and Whirlpool. However, the opinion of Wasabi is considered irrelevant due to their privacy issues and their decision to work with chain analysis firms that assist governments in censorship. Moreover, the tweet claiming that Full-RBF provides well-connected mining pools with an added advantage is proven to be false. The discussion concludes with the clarification that attackers can already perform DoS attacks by double-spending inputs used in coinjoin without Full-RBF, and it is not an effective attack.</p>
