    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Dave, the former asks about how participants in a double-spend scenario can learn of the occurrence in order to respond appropriately. Dave suggests there are various ways to do this and indicates that any protocol software should have a conflict monitoring system to detect such attacks. By using this system, it can defeat not just the $17.00 pinning attack but also the $0.05 individual conflicting input attack without requiring full-RBF. Dave asserts that full-RBF provides no additional benefits beyond those already offered by other necessary tools.</p>
