    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In November 2022, Michael Folkson tweeted about the bugs in btcd and the analysis paralysis on a RBF policy option in Core. He suggested that Bitcoin Knots and consensus-compatible forks of Core might be the future. He also mentioned his idea of a bare bones Knots style Bitcoin implementation integrated with Core Lightning. Despite the dysfunction in the management of Bitcoin Core project, he believes that Core Lightning is managed effectively in the open. However, it lacks the usage that Bitcoin Core does. Michael feels that the current way the Bitcoin Core project is being managed is not how an open-source project should be managed. Decisions seem to be increasingly made behind closed doors or in private IRC channels. The libbitcoinkernel project was an attempt to extract the consensus engine out of Core but it seems like it won't achieve that as consensus is just too slippery a concept. Hence, Knots style consensus compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core seem to be the model.He acknowledges that it would be an ambitious long term project to merge Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning into one codebase. Michael is floating the idea to hear from people who are much more familiar with the entirety of the Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning codebases. It would be nice to focus on some ambitious project(s) (even if just conceptually) for a while given there seems to be a lull in soft fork activation chaos.</p>
