        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Aymeric Vitte, a French programmer, has proposed two systems based on the Bitcoin blockchain - a Bitcoin NFT system and a Universal Coin Swap system. The NFT system aims to create a simple NFT system that can prove ownership on the blockchain and unlike other solutions, the proof of deals for the NFT system is stored in OP_RETURN and can be turned into bitcoin contracts. The Universal Coin Swap system aims to create a simple, secure, decentralized, and inexpensive system that works for all blockchains/tokens based on Bitcoin.The author believes that Bitcoin is currently out of the future web3 and that Lightning will not solve everything. They propose something simple, secure, decentralized, easy to implement and use, and not expensive for users. The proposals aim to store real proof in OP_RETURN without flooding the Bitcoin network with irrelevant data.The trust in the proposals is more based on a reputation model, and the cheater risks losing their Bitcoin or being tagged as a cheater. The author sees Lightning as a middle/long-term relationship between people, while their proposals are aimed at one-time deals, which may involve buying something else from the seller with a different coin in a different location (such as metaverse). The author invites review and feedback on their proposals and provides links to their CV, LinkedIn profile, GitHub, wallet, and other projects like bitcoin-transactions, torrent-live, node-Tor, dynamic blocklist, and Peersm. They argue that Bitcoin is better than other systems in all aspects. The proposals facilitate the selling of secret NFTs and remain decentralized, unlike existing tools or wallets.</p>
