    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around a name for the smaller units of Bitcoin. Suggestions include "bit" and "ubit" pronounced as "you-bit". The advantages of "bit" are that it is short, memorable, and pronounceable by speakers of most languages. Moreover, "bit" refers to a small amount of something in its regular English usage. However, "bit" can collide with slang for phallus in French and mean louse in Turkish. On the other hand, "ubit" ties in a visual way to the metric micro and leaves the required 2 decimal places for the marginally numerate. The downsides of "ubit" include the fact that Î¼ is not a U, but a lowercase M in Greek, and calling it a U conveys a notion of global unawareness. Furthermore, culturally neutral names are preferred so as to avoid deliberately invoking cultural references in the name.</p>
