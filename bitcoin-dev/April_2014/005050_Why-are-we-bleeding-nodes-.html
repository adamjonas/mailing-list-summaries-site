    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A concern about the dropping of nodes in Bitcoin has been raised and it is difficult to determine how many nodes are really needed. Jameson has posted his thoughts on this issue and is working on a node monitoring project to gain new insights. Mike Hearn has also raised concerns about the decrease in nodes from 10,000 at the start of February to 8,500 currently. He is looking for more insight into why people might stop running a node and suggests an exit survey via email. It would be helpful if subVer contained the operating system so that it could be determined if the loss of nodes is mostly from desktops/laptops or virtual servers. A solution like adding an email address to the config file could help track why nodes disappear.</p>
