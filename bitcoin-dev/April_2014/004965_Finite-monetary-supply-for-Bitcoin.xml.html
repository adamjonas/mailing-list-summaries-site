    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille proposed a controversial idea to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency, as he believes the current subsidy schedule cannot be accepted anymore. He wrote a draft BIP and shared it with the community for comments. In his proposal, he suggests reducing the block reward by half every four years until it reaches zero, which would result in a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins. Pieter Wuille pointed out that Dogecoin has already implemented similar changes, making it easy to explore this idea. The proposal can be found on GitHub. Luke-Jr made some minor edits to the proposal and shared it again on GitHub.</p>
