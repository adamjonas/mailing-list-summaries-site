    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about compressing the blockchain, it is suggested that compression is orthogonal to pruning. The main problem with compressing the blockchain is that it mostly consists of random bytes (hashes, keys) which do not compress well enough to change the fundamental physics. However, it is suggested that in a future where the chain is gigantic, it could be stored on tape and spooled off at high speed, using direct DMA from tape drive to NIC. It is acknowledged that older nodes may require less replication than newer ones, but the block distribution algorithm can sort this out. Suggestions are welcomed for improving the storage of the blockchain. Finally, a link is provided for Jenkins Continuous Integration, promoting the automation of build, test, and deployment.</p>
