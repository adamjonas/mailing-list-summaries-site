    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 2, 2014, the Bitcoin-development mailing list received a message from Kevin, who claimed to have forked Bitcoin Core and was working on a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin. However, the link he provided to his project was suspicious and led to a phishing site. Some members of the mailing list questioned the legitimacy of Kevin's project, while others suggested that he may have accidentally linked to the wrong website. Laszlo Hanyecz even speculated that Kevin's use of speech to text or other assistive technology may have caused him to write "U R L" instead of "URL." Jud eventually pointed out that Kevin's legitimate repository was located at <a href="https://github.com/kjsisco/bitcoin/tree/patch-1">https://github.com/kjsisco/bitcoin/tree/patch-1</a>. In subsequent messages, Kevin expressed frustration at the confusion surrounding his project, assured the others that he was not engaged in phishing, and promised to register a domain for his project and create a proper webpage.</p>
