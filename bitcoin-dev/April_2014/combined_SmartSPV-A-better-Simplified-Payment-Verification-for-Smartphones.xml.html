        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>NimbleCoin is a new cryptocurrency that uses the FastBlock5 protocol to achieve near-instant payments. SmartSPV comes into play when bandwidth is limited or clients are disconnected from the Internet for long periods. It is a variation of the standard SPV headers-only mode that allows a smartphone to keep a fairly accurate state of the wallet balance without downloading all the missing headers and without sacrificing battery life and time. In Smart-SPV mode, when a client is missing block headers two things happen simultaneously: The client starts downloading block headers from the last one solved backward, and the client starts downloading the blocks headers from the first missing header, forward.While the client catches up with all the missing blocks, the wallet balance may not be fully reliable. Still, if a new payment is received and confirmed, or a new payment is made, the wallet will increase the balance and show it. A live block is flagged as LIVE and this flag is stored permanently with the block. A live transaction is a transaction that is included in a live block. When a live transaction is confirmed by six blocks flagged as LIVE, the transaction is considered mature. All mature transactions are scanned and used to compute the balance of the wallet. Also, all transactions that are included in blocks rooted at the last checkpoint and finishing in the last live block are also considered mature.In an email conversation between Sergio Lerner and Mike Hearn, the issue of handling 17K block headers a day in NimbleCoin currency's SPV mode was discussed. Lerner proposed a variation of the standard headers-only SPV mode called SmartSPV, which he believes could also be implemented by BitcoinJ for Bitcoin. Additionally, Lerner mentioned that if one has the freedom to specify things and control the headers, then SPV evaluations of work can have log(n) scaling. This concept was further explained in a link provided by Lerner to a mail archive discussion.As a suggestion to address the issue of headers in reverse, Lerner referred to a wiki page on reverse header-fetching sync authored by Gmaxwell. The page provides ideas and insights on how to handle header syncing more efficiently. If the SPV client clock is correctly synchronized, the Smart-SPV protocol does not pose any additional security risk different from the known SPV limitations.</p>
