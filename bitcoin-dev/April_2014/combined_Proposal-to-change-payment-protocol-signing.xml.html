        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In April 2014, there was a discussion regarding the clarification of how BIP70 signs payment requests. The issue at hand was what to do with the signature field before signing. Gavin Andresen, a developer of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), suggested that instead of setting the signature to an empty string, it should be cleared so that it is not serialized at all. He notes that this type of mistake is why BIPs take time before being declared as "Final." The current code sets the signature to an empty string, but Andresen believes that this is a mistake and changes need to be made now while BIP70 is still in draft status. Mike Hearn argues that changing the signature field now would be too difficult and cause chaos for early adopters. He suggests that setting the signature field to an empty byte array is fine, as the payment protocol is already being implemented by various wallets and companies such as BitPay and Coinbase. Ryan X. Charles, a software engineer at BitPay, is included in the email thread. Consensus is the spec should be clarified to match current behavior, so it won't change. There is already a BIP70 in use with over a hundred paid requests. If anyone is implementing or has implemented the payment protocol, they are encouraged to chime in. The adoption of the payment protocol is seen as vulnerable at this stage and any changes could seriously hurt it. Gavin wants to change the specification and reference implementation while BIP70 is still a draft. The email also includes a link to a free automated cross-browser testing platform. This type of mistake is the reason why BIPs take a while before being declared 'Final.'</p>
