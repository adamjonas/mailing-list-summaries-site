    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Wladimir expressed concern over the security of running a Bitcoin wallet on Windows XP. He noted that even his bank was warning customers not to do internet banking with the outdated operating system. While it might be okay to run a node on XP, wallets have keys that must be protected. The question was raised about whether to warn users and allow them to continue using XP or redirect them to a message on bitcoin.org about the dangers of using the unsupported OS. However, dropping XP support completely could result in a loss of nodes, especially in countries like China and Russia where many computers still run XP. Other wallet software maintainers were asked how they planned to handle the situation and if they would also drop XP support. Kevin suggested investigating the warning and determining whether XP was truly insecure for Bitcoin use.</p>
