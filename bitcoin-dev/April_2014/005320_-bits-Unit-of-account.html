    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the naming of a smaller unit of bitcoin. Some suggest using "ubit" which represents 1e-6 bitcoin, while others prefer simply using "bit" as it is short, memorable, and pronounceable by speakers of most languages. The downsides of using "bit" include potential ambiguity if "XBT" were to represent 1e-6 BTC on the world stage. Additionally, some argue that "bit" may not be culturally neutral, as it phonetically collides with slang for phallus in French and means "louse" in Turkish. There is also a suggestion to use "ebit" or "xbit" which could still be represented as XBT and define x as "coin/1000000". Ultimately, it is concluded that the term for smaller units of bitcoin will arise naturally over time.</p>
