        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Oliver Egginger reported that the bitcoin-qt alert system is causing unnecessary alerts on many systems, which can be frightening for normal users. The alert is related to the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL and is generated based on the client's version number. The issue seems to be specific to the Ubuntu bitcoin ppa, which is dynamically linked to OpenSSL, unlike the binaries available from bitcoin.org. This means that users with static linking are also being notified, even though they are not affected by the vulnerability. Patrick responded to the mailing list, explaining that there is currently no way to notify only users with dynamic linking without also notifying those with static linking. This limitation in the alert system is causing confusion and panic among users. Oliver suggested that if possible, the message should be turned off to prevent further false positives and harmful workarounds.Jameson added to the conversation, informing everyone that Matt has pushed out new builds to the Ubuntu PPA. This suggests that the issue should resolve itself shortly as the new builds will likely address the unnecessary alerts. The email thread concludes with two links provided for further information. The first link leads to a free guide called "Graph Databases" by O'Reilly Books, which could be useful for those interested in learning more about graph databases. The second link directs users to the Bitcoin-development mailing list on SourceForge, where they can find additional discussions and updates related to Bitcoin development.</p>
