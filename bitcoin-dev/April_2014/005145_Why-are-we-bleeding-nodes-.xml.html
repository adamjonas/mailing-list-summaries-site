    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Eric Martindale discusses the importance of simplifying Bitcoin wallets. He suggests that it needs to be so simple that average users don't need to think about it during normal use. Currently, Coinbase and Bitstamp offer a better user experience, but they technically endanger the user and the Bitcoin network. Multi-sig as a default is a start, but the education process needs to begin with the fundamental idea that trusting a third-party with full access to your Bitcoin is just replacing one centralized banking system with another. Wendell agrees with Eric's points and thinks there is potential for Hive to make desktop and mobile wallets easy to use. He asks if this is now a community priority and invites additional contributors to Hive. Links to the GitHub pages for Hive OSX and Hive Android are provided, along with links to hivewallet.com, the Hive Twitter account, and the Camp Bitcoin website.</p>
