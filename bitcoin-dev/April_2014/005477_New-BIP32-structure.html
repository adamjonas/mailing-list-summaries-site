    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Pavol Rusnak and Gregory Maxwell are discussing the issue of funds being split across two wallets. While Gregory suggests that it would be better to clarify that users MUST NOT do so silently as it would lead to a bad user experience, Pavol argues that it makes perfect sense for funds across accounts to never mix. The purpose of having multiple accounts is to keep balances separated, and there is no need to pay special attention to which UTXOs are consumed in transactions from any of the accounts. There is only one use case where tracking UTXOs per-account is necessary, and that is when you want to have multiple uncoordinated copies of the wallet in use at the same time. However, even then, you could still mix funds as long as you use only the first UTXO for tracking. Pavol points out that classic bank accounts work the same way - funds across accounts never mix. Banks always mix funds, and you don't expect your bank wire to use exactly the specific dollar bills you deposited.</p>
