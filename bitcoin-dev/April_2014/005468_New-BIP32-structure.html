    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Pavol Rusnak and Pieter Wuille on April 23, 2014, they discussed the behavior of software that scans all accounts specified by BIP64 without providing a user interface option to distinguish them or keep the coins apart. Pavol Rusnak stated that this is not the desired behavior and asked if Pieter Wuille had any ideas on how to make it more explicit in the spec. Currently, the Account section of the spec states that the key space is split into independent user identities so that the wallet never mixes the coins across different accounts. Pavol Rusnak also expressed his desire to make it obvious from the spec that mixing funds across accounts is not compliant with the spec and not the right thing to do. In response, Luke questioned why anyone would need to mix funds between accounts since only a very niche user base would need funds to be isolated.</p>
