    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Tamas Blummer and Wladimir, the former points out that the motivation of the SPV wallet is to extend functionality. As such, he suggests that the index should be specific to the added features and the subset of the blockchain that is of interest for the wallet. He also notes that adding huge generic purpose indices to core would discourage people from using full nodes due to excess requirements. Tamas believes that nothing would add more to the core's popularity as a trusted background node to SPV than full validation at the lowest possible memory, disk, and CPU footprint. He suggests that serving headers should be default but storing and serving full blocks configurable to ranges so people can tailor to their bandwidth and space available. Wladimir responds by saying that adding an RPC call for an "address -> utxo" query wouldn't be a big deal. He notes that spent history would involve a much larger index, and it's not likely to end up in Bitcoin.</p>
