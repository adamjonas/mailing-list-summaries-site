    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn proposed that miners should have the ability to vote to disregard output scripts, allowing them to reallocate the coinbase value of bad blocks before they mature. If a majority of blocks leading up to maturity vote for reallocation, the value goes into a pot that subsequent blocks are allowed to claim for themselves. Miners can also orphan bad blocks without changing the protocol. However, some believe that changing the network to allow miners to decide which valid scripts will be honored and which ones will not is problematic. They argue that it would no longer be a machine faithfully processing scripts and that it could lead to future proposals for miners to confiscate and redistribute balances.</p>
