    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Kevin, the former suggested that the double-spending problem can be solved using blockchain technology. However, he pointed out that this only works when transactions are in a block. The issue at hand is preventing double-spending before confirmation, which has always been a best-effort mechanism in the network. In response to the second question, Wuille proposed introducing a mechanism where miners can vote to penalize other miners for allowing double-spends. However, this mechanism raises concerns as there is no requirement for proof of double-spending, and it allows miners to penalize others for any reason.</p>
