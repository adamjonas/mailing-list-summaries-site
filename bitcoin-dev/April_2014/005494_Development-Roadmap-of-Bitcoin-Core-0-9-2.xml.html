    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Wladimir, Gregory Maxwell and Warren Togami Jr., they discuss the compatibility of Bitcoin-Qt on different systems. Warren suggests that rare users who need Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system can build it from source. However, Gregory notes that Tails users usually cannot build it from source as it is a live boot mostly stateless Linux distribution for privacy applications. Wladimir questions whether Bitcoin Core is suitable for such uses, considering running a full node on a stateless system seems unlikely. As there are issues with compatibility, the group discusses possible solutions, including getting rid of one symbol or putting it behind some #ifdef COMPATIBILITY_BUILD or building against the 4.6 Qt headers instead without even swapping the library, which will lose some GUI features, but if compatibility is more important, that's a choice that can be made. Warren believes they need to decide upon a cut-off point beyond which it makes no sense to add the risk of increased complexity, noting that RHEL6 had qt-4.6.2, and he has not heard any complaints about bitcoin-qt being broken there, given almost nobody uses it as a desktop.</p>
