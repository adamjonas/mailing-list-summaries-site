    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post on the Bitcoin-Development mailing list, Tamas Blummer questioned the usefulness of testnet in BIPs. He argues that while testnet is useful for certain types of testing, it is far less important than to be addressed in every future BIP. Blummer suggests that the existence of testnet is likely a consequence of Satoshi not writing unit tests and having automated integration tests, but creating a shadow chain to try things out, mostly manually. However, he acknowledges that testnet can be useful for shared chains with worthless tokens and transactions. For automated tests, chains-in-a-box are better as they can easily create and exactly re-create weird situations on-the-fly. Blummer also notes that several people argued to use a level of the hierarchy to identify the chain the key is used on, which could identify testnet as well as an alt coin chain.</p>
