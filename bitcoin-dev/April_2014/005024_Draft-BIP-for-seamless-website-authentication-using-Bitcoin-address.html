    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on April 4, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed concern about the use of a web plugin for TREZOR. He noted that if nobody installs plugins, there could be a problem, but also mentioned that the plugin was not required. Marek responded by stating that they saw the plugin as a temporary solution and hoped to eliminate it once there was a way to communicate with USB HID directly from the browser. While this was not yet possible, efforts were already underway to make it happen.</p>
