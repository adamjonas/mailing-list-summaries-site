    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context presents a disagreement with a proposal to turn Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency. The author believes that Satoshi intended this monetary supply from the beginning, and we should not go against his will. Additionally, the author suggests that instead of a soft fork, a hard fork could be used to redesign the whole system and switch to a new script engine. Pieter Wuille proposed the controversial idea of turning Bitcoin into a limited-supply currency in 2014. He believed that the current subsidy schedule was unacceptable and presented a draft BIP for discussion. He referred to Dogecoin as an example of how easy such changes are to implement. The proposal can be found on a Gist page, and comments were requested.</p>
