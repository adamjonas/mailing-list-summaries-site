    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the concept of proof-of-stake as a replacement for proof-of-work, concerns were raised regarding the lack of stake in proof-of-stake and the potential for double-spending. While some have proposed protocols involving proof of stake mechanisms, it appears that they still rely on proof-of-work mining to function effectively. A poll conducted on bitcointalk showed minority support for Bitcoin proof-of-stake, but it remains a prohibited yet disputed change to Bitcoin Core. Stephen Reed proposes creating a Bitcoin branch that provides a sandboxed testbed for researching the best PoS implementations, with the goal of developing, testing, and documenting PoS while exploring its vulnerabilities and fixing them transparently. Some have suggested calling it 'bitstake' to differentiate it from Bitcoin.</p>
