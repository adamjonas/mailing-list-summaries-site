        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2014, Mike Hearn proposed a mechanism for Bitcoin transactions that involved an escrow service to prevent buyers from continuously requesting refunds. This proposal was similar to Jeremy Spilman's micropayment channel. However, there was no further discussion on the topic in the email thread. The proposed mechanism for a single payment is similar to Spilman's micropayment channel. The concern is whether wallet UIs can handle it without being too complicated for users. High-value transactions take advantage of existing escrow solutions, such as Localbitcoins, where sellers can escrow their funds with Localbitcoins before releasing them to the buyer. With nLockTime, a third-party escrow agent is not required. Instead, prior to sending the funds to the escrow address, the buyer signs a refund transaction that unlocks at some time in the future. Local Trader is functionality built into the Mycelium Android wallet that helps users trade cash for bitcoins by finding traders in their local area. Local Trader already has pre-meetup buyer to seller communication built-in. The implementation sketch of Mycelium Local Trader shows how it can be extended to self-escrow.Transaction malleability is an issue that needs to be addressed. Adding a third-party escrow to the two-party escrow is a last-ditch measure to ensure that if malleability is an issue, the third-party can release locked funds manually. Secondly, a future soft-fork such as Pieter Wuille's BIP62 can eliminate malleability.When it comes to online shopping, various e-commerce platforms and marketplaces have addressed the concern of buyers always requesting refunds through clear return policies, customer reviews, and buyer protection programs. For instance, Amazon allows customers to return items within a specific time frame, usually 30 days. Similarly, eBay's Money Back Guarantee ensures that buyers receive the item they ordered or get their money back. Other online retailers also have similar return policies in place to prevent abuse of the system. Overall, while there may be a fear of frequent refunds, e-commerce platforms and retailers have taken steps to minimize this risk through various measures. In addition, Peter Todd proposed a mechanism that is similar to Jeremy Spilman's micropayment channel for a single payment, and Reddit user RubenSomsen suggested a similar idea on Mycelium where users can temporarily lock their bitcoins in a 2-of-2 transaction with a potential buyer before meeting.</p>
