    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-development mailing list is discussing ways to improve the efficiency of existing implementations of the protocol. Slush suggests that many bitcoind instances are running, but not properly configured for port forwarding. He suggests a self-test to indicate when nodes are not reachable from outside, as well as adding IPv6 tunnelling to make instances ipv6-reachable automatically. Gregory Maxwell argues that existing implementations are inefficient in many known ways and that the actual resource requirements for the protocol are low, it is just a question of modest implementation improvements. Another issue mentioned is that the main constraint with home devices is not their actual power, but rather that many people no longer keep computers switched on all the time. This means that SPV wallets can't help security because they always sync from the p2p network for performance reasons. It is suggested that optimising NAT tunneling code may help and starting by adding more diagnostic stuff to the GUI. STUN support may also be helpful.</p>
