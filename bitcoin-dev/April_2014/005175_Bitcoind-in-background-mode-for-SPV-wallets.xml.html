    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Justus Ranvier replied to concerns about resource usage in the Bitcoin network. Ranvier stated that while there are comments both confirming and denying the problem in open public forums, counting comments is not a reliable way to assess technical considerations. He argued that the list is meant for developing protocols and implementations to improve efficiency, and that the costs of the best realistic option should be considered when discussing incentives. Ranvier claimed that full nodes can currently be operated with vastly fewer resources than current implementations use, and that it's just a question of relatively modest implementation improvements. He stated that existing implementations are inefficient in many known ways and some unknown ones, but discussions in the forum contribute to prioritizing improvements over existing implementations.</p>
