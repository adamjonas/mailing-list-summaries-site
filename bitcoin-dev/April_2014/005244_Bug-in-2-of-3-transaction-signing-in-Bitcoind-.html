    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Mike Hearn recommended using btcd, the Go implementation of bitcoind, for its superior error and diagnostic messages. He found it helpful in debugging his own multi-sig transactions. In response to a discussion about a rejected transaction, Matt Whitlock clarified that if a transaction is already in the blockchain, it cannot be accepted again as it would be double-spending itself. However, they had been trying to get a 2-of-3 transaction accepted for hours and everything was rejecting it. It turned out that something had accepted it without them noticing. They were starting over and attempting to reproduce the success or failure. The email also included a promotion for a free book on Graph Databases.</p>
