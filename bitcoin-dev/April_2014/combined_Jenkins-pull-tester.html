        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Drak is seeking guidance or instructions to establish a bitcoin pull-tester on Jenkins. However, there is no information about the platform where the request was made available as no link has been provided. The request seems to be solely focused on setting up a bitcoin pull-tester on Jenkins which suggests that Drak may have some prior knowledge of Bitcoin and Jenkins. Jenkins is an open-source automation server that can be used for continuous integration and continuous delivery. A bitcoin pull-tester, on the other hand, is a tool that Bitcoin developers use to test their code. It checks whether the changes made to the code are compatible with the existing codebase before merging them into the main branch. By using pull-tester on Jenkins, developers can automate the testing process.Since Drak is looking for guidance or instructions, it is possible that they may not have experience in setting up a bitcoin pull-tester on Jenkins. In such cases, they will need a step-by-step guide that explains how to set up a pull-tester on Jenkins. Alternatively, Drak could be familiar with Jenkins but not know how to integrate a bitcoin pull-tester. In this scenario, Drak would require guidance on integrating a bitcoin pull-tester with Jenkins.Without more details, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive solution to Drak's request. As a result, it is recommended that Drak seek help from the Bitcoin community or reach out to individuals who have experience with setting up a bitcoin pull-tester on Jenkins.</p>
