    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses the issue of authentication on websites with Bitcoin. It questions whether a login system is necessary and argues that very few websites would want to authenticate with only a Bitcoin address, as there would be no way to email the user or retrieve data if the wallet is lost. However, having a standard protocol for authentication could lead to new use cases such as physical locker rental or booking hotel rooms via Bitcoin. The author acknowledges potential issues with shared transactions and losing phones, but believes that leveraging existing tools such as client certificates could help overcome these challenges. Ultimately, the decision to use a cryptographic token over a password is a matter of personal preference and security measures already in place for Bitcoin wallets can be used for authentication purposes.</p>
