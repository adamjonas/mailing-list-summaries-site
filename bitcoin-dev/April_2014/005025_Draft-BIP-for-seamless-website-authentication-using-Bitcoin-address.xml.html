    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the usage of plugins for TREZOR and how it can pose a problem if people are reluctant to install them. However, the author mentions that browsers can handle the process without the need for a plugin. The main focus of the conversation is on making the sign-up and login process for Bitcoin ecosystem websites and apps more user-friendly. The author believes that the ease of use will result in more people signing up, leading to an expansion of the ecosystem and ultimately increasing the global value of Bitcoin. The author emphasizes that wallets are a crucial part of this equation since everyone has one and should have already taken steps to secure their keys. Additionally, using a Bitcoin address for identification purposes on a Bitcoin-related service makes sense.</p>
