    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list had a discussion on whether mining empty blocks before downloading and verifying the blocks could reduce transaction fees. However, this policy would leave smaller miners disadvantaged and harm the security of Bitcoin. Large miners can increase the time it takes for small miners to hear about blocks by increasing the size of their blocks. The orphans in the system are probabilistic and are only resolved after hearing about a new block that lengthens the chain.The discussion also touched upon the unit of account to use in Bitcoin specifically for small amounts. One person suggested "credits," while another person suggested "ubit" (pronounced "YOU-bit"), representing 1e-6 bitcoin. The term "bit" was not preferred as it has cultural implications in French and Turkish. As Bitcoin is not yet in common use except for speculation, no term for smaller units has established itself yet. The email also contains a PGP signature and a link to download eXo Platform, which enables building an Enterprise Intranet with Java Based Open Source Intranet - Social, Extensible, Cloud Ready features. The email suggests using the software to turn an intranet into a collaboration platform. The email was sent from the Bitcoin-development mailing list and invites recipients to register for the list.</p>
