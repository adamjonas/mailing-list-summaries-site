    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a software engineer, proposed a question regarding the compatibility of certain software with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 64 (BIP64). The software in question would scan all accounts as specified by BIP64, but it would not have a user interface option to distinguish them in any way or view them independently. Additionally, it would have no ability to keep coins separate between different accounts. Pavol Rusnak responded by saying that this behavior is not desired and suggested making it more explicit in the spec. Currently, the Account section of the spec states that the wallet should never mix coins across different accounts. Rusnak wants to make it clear that mixing funds across accounts is not compliant with the spec.</p>
