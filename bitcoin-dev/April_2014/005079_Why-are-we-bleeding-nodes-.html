    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell clarified his recent statement about the resource requirements of a full node. When discussing requirements he was referring to "reality as it currently exists", rather than hypothetical future requirements. He also stated that he was not suggesting there were implementation issues that needed to be improved for low resource users, but rather that the use of Bitcoin was expanding beyond hobbyists, and that the increase in the number of people using Bitcoin could lead to technical challenges. Maxwell had previously commented on the scalability of Bitcoin's blockchain, pointing out that while the technology offered significant benefits over traditional payment systems, the requirement for all nodes to store a copy of the blockchain made it difficult for individuals with limited resources to participate in the network.</p>
