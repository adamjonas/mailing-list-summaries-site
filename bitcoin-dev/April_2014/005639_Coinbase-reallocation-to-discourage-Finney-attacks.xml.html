    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on April 30th, 2014, Mike Hearn and an unknown individual discussed the topic of attackers in regards to Bitcoin. Hearn stated that parties wouldn't generally consider themselves attackers, to which the individual responded that attackers rarely do. Hearn argued that if Bitcoin works correctly, nobody should have to care whether they consider themselves attackers, defenders, or little green men from Mars. Rather, there are simply nodes that follow the protocol and nodes that do not. He expressed concern that the fact that one needs to think about who should and should not be considered an attacker in the context of a proposed change should be ringing alarm bells. When asked what miners exist for, Hearn replied that they exist for ordering transactions.</p>
