    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The number of full nodes running Bitcoin Core is decreasing and it may be due to other wallets offering more features and better usability. To address this issue, Wladimir proposed the idea of adding an option to popular SPV wallets that would spin a bitcoind process in the background. This would provide increased security for the user as the SPV wallet would have a local trusted node. Tamas Blummer suggested that the core should focus on being a lightweight superfast consensus building border router without any wallet, GUI, RPC calls, or payment protocol. The core could also accommodate this 'embedded' usage by providing specific interfaces, special builds, bindings, DLLs, etc. Overall, the goal is to ensure that serious users of Bitcoin run a bitcoind as a border router and connect SPV wallets with higher functionality to that trusted node(s) to ensure they are all on the same trunk of the chain.</p>
