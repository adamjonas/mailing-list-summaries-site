    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The MtGox shutdown on February 24th may have caused a decline in Bitcoin community interest and usage, as seen by a decrease in transaction traffic since then. Many well-known individuals lost money in the MtGox debacle, but despite this, many Bitcoin users still deposit their funds with third parties like Bitstamp. This raises concerns that another large bitbank may experience similar issues in the future. The author worries that people's inability or unwillingness to properly use Bitcoin could eventually lead to its demise, as the general public does not distinguish between those who use third-party services and those who do not.</p>
