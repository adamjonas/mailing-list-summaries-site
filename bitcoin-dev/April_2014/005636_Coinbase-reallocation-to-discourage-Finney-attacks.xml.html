    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email from 2014, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn criticized the idea of Bitcoin being seen as a natural mathematical law and stated that implementing any feature allowing for balances to be confiscated would render Bitcoin valueless. He claimed that proposals to implement such a feature were either malicious attempts to undermine Bitcoin or evidence of economic illiteracy, which he regarded as a danger to all Bitcoin users. Regardless of abilities or motives, Hearn rejected such proposals, suggesting that those who wanted to create a currency where miners could vote to steal from each other should implement it in their own alternative to Bitcoin. Furthermore, Hearn encouraged the use of email encryption to support online privacy, providing a link to a tutorial on how to do so.</p>
