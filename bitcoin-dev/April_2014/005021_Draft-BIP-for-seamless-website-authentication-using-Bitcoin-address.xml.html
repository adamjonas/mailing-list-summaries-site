    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from 2014, a user named "slush" expressed interest in using TREZOR for web authentication purposes. However, they were struggling to find a usable solution. They commented on a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and suggested not using bitcoin addresses directly and not encouraging services to use this login for financial purposes. Slush recommended using a function to generate a private/public key from the bitcoin seed/private key to prevent leaking bitcoin-related data. Another user named Eric questioned the risks of identifying oneself with a bitcoin address planned to be used for website transactions. He asked what the difference was between identifying with a bitcoin address and adding it to a settings field after logging in with a username and password.</p>
