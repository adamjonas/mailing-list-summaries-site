        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On May 2, 2014, Kristov Atlas confirmed that a dev binary runs smoothly in the latest version of Tails, v1.0, which was tested by him. Wladimir assured that the usual Linux binary would be compatible when incorporated into the next release of Bitcoin Core, but he mentioned the possibility of adding a binary linked to Qt 5.x for newer distributions at some point. Compatibility remains their primary concern. Earlier on April 30th, 2014, Kristov Atlas reported an issue with a binary built by Wladimir where the GUI segfaulted after choosing the default datadir. However, Wladimir fixed the issue and created a new test build which is available for download from visucore.com. This dev binary was confirmed to run smoothly in Tails v1.0 by Kristov Atlas. It is unclear whether this will make the usual Linux binary compatible or if there will be a special binary just for systems running the older Qt.In another email sent on April 26, 2014, Kristov Atlas thanked Wladimir for building a binary to fix the initial problem with Qt, but mentioned that after choosing the default datadir, it still segfaulted. Wladimir addressed this issue and made a new test build available for download. The details of the fix can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4094">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4094</a>. The new test build can be downloaded from <a href="https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/linux-gitian-3cbabfa.tar.gz,">https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/linux-gitian-3cbabfa.tar.gz,</a> with signatures available at <a href="https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/linux-gitian-3cbabfa.tar.gz.sig.The">https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/linux-gitian-3cbabfa.tar.gz.sig.The</a> context also includes a sample terminal output for the latest Tails operating system version 0.23. The user encountered errors when attempting to run the bitcoin-qt command, including "Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address," "IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon," and "sendto: Operation not permitted." Additionally, a "Segmentation fault" error occurred when running the command with a proxy. The user requested a traceback from Wladimir, the creator of Bitcoin.In an email exchange between Wladimir and Kristov, Wladimir mentioned modifying the gitian build to work with Qt 4.6 instead of Qt 4.8 in a pull request. He provided a test build of master with the updated gitian descriptor that should work on Debian Squeeze/Tails Linux. Kristov confirmed that the initial problem with Qt was resolved and he was able to load the GUI to choose his datadir. However, after selecting the default datadir, it segfaulted. The "sendto: Operation not permitted" message indicated that Core couldn't connect to the internet without going through Tails' Tor SOCKS proxy. When Kristov specified the SOCKS proxy through the command-line, there was a brief flash of the GUI before it segfaulted again. The "Bus::open" and "IBusInputContext::createInputContext" messages were considered atypical and might be related to the segfault. Lastly, in an email conversation between Kristov Atlas and Warren Togami Jr. on April 23, 2014, Kristov shared that he had modified the gitian build to use Qt 4.6 instead of 4.8, aiming to make it compatible with Tails/Debian Squeeze. He provided a link to a test build of master with the updated gitian descriptor that should work on Debian Squeeze / Tails Linux, along with the links to download the bitcoin-qt executables.</p>
