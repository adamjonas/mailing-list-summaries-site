    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin core development team should not spend precious coding hours chasing the goal of creating a node that can run on laptops, as desktop tower machines are dying and will not be coming back. However, the author argues that people have found it most efficient to work at a static desk for centuries and that desktop usage and sales will bottom out a long way from zero. Even just 1% of bitcoin users leaving their machine on could vastly outweigh the smaller percentage who would run nodes on expensive hosted capacity out of the goodness of their hearts. By educating users about the privacy advantages of full nodes and providing software that automatically contributes back within defined limits, tens of thousands more useful nodes could be created. The author suggests taking advantage of the fault tolerance inherent in what they are doing and ensuring that software can shrug off nodes with a few % of downtime. However, this doesn't fit in the business plans of those who might want to run full nodes to data mine and deanonymize users for marketing, tax collection, and law enforcement - one of the few profitable things to do with a full node.</p>
