    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Warren Togami Jr. and Kristov Atlas discussed the compatibility of Bitcoin-Qt with Tails/Debian Squeeze in an email exchange on April 23, 2014. Atlas reported that the latest nightly build was still not compatible with Tails/Debian Squeeze and asked if there was any intention to address the issue. Togami responded that bitcoind works but not bitcoin-qt due to qt-4.6. He added that the official Bitcoin 0.8.6 binaries didn't work on Squeeze either, so it is not a regression. The priority is for bitcoind to work on as many distributions as possible as older stable distributions are most often headless. If a user needs Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system, they can build it from source.Atlas pointed out that Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.6 worked fine on Tails (and Debian Squeeze, presumably), making it a regression. He shared the output from the latest nightly build for Linux, which gave an error message about an undefined symbol when attempting to run bitcoin-qt. However, since Tails has stripped out many simple development tools like "make" for security reasons, building from source in Tails is not straightforward. Atlas suggested that it might be possible to build in Debian Squeeze and transplant that. He argued that Tails is an important Linux distribution that Bitcoin should support. A link to Tails' press page was provided for reference.</p>
