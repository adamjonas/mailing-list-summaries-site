    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Wladimir van der Laan, the lead developer of Bitcoin Core, addressed concerns about the potential impact of high traffic on Bitcoin nodes. He stated that the default maximum amount of connections is 125, which should not be a problem for home routers even if they are cheaply made. Additionally, Bitcoin does not use UDP, so there should be no impact from UDP traffic. However, filling up a home DSL or cable modem's send buffer with outgoing data is possible and could cause delays in interactive traffic. Throttling to prevent this is planned but postponed until parallel block download is implemented. When asked about using uTP to improve network performance, Wladimir stated that there were enough other areas for improvement to focus on first, and that benchmarking and analysis should be done to identify these areas.</p>
