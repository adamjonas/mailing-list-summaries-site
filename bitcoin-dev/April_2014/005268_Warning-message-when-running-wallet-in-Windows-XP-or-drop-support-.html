    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread about the security of Windows XP for internet banking and Bitcoin wallets, Wladimir expressed concern that if even banks were warning against using Windows XP for online banking, it was definitely not secure enough to run a wallet. This prompted a suggestion from another user that multi-wallet support could eventually eliminate the need for default wallets and instead allow users to create their own, with options for added security measures like hardware security modules or multisig secured wallets.The user also suggested that if a user decides to run an ordinary unsecured wallet, the software could detect whether the host is known to not be secure and prompt them to follow best security practices. By implementing these changes, the user argued that people who never run a wallet or use a hardware security module would not be unnecessarily targeted by security warnings, making host security less of an issue overall.</p>
