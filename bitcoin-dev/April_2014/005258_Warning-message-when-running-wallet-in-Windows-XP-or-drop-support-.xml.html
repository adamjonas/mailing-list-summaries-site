    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The topic being discussed is the support of XP as a platform for Bitcoin Core. It is mentioned that if they say they support XP, they must run test passes against it and address any bugs reported by XP users. This makes it a test and support issue rather than a security issue. However, it is stated that it doesn't make sense to support an OS platform that the original vendor (Microsoft) no longer supports themselves. When asked if an alert message should be added to wallet installers stating that the software will not run on Windows XP, it is said that it is not their place to police it. It is also mentioned that running Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP is perfectly safe, but caution should be taken with the wallet functionality. The email ends with a promotion for a free book on graph databases and a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
