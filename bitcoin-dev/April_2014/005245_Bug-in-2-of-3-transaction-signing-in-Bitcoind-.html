    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Tuesday, 15 April 2014, Mike Belshe recommends btcd as a better implementation of bitcoind due to its error/diagnostics messages. In his follow-up post, he gives more information about the tool he has built in C++, which is a Swiss Army knife of Bitcoin allowing for key and address conversions, hash functions, encoding and decoding, script disassembly, BIP38 encryption/decryption, the Shamir Secret Sharing and transaction building and signing. The tool has its own wallet and UTXO cache that syncs with bitcoind's block data files by memory mapping them and doing a full scan of the entire blockchain in about a minute. The wallet can contain keys, seeds and multi-signature aggregates, derived from sequences of multi-sig P2SH addresses from a set of public seeds. The team tests by sending bitcoins to those addresses, finding the outputs in the block chain using their tool, creating transactions that redeem them, and then signing those transactions by supplying private seeds to the tool. The tool is much easier to use than bitcoind and requires less complicated command-line syntax.</p>
