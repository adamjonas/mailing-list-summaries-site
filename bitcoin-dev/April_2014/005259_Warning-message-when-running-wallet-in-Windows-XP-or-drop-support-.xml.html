    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core team does not support Windows XP, or any other distribution. They clarify that they might assume the question refers to providing a binary which runs on X. The team does not provide binaries for Windows XP and it doesn't make sense to support an OS platform that Microsoft no longer supports. While it may not be their place to say whether XP is secure or not, if they support it, then it becomes a test and support issue, not a security issue. If an XP user reports a bug, they have to do something to address it, which would lead to more issues. It's safe to run Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP, but people should be careful about using the wallet functionality as it is not supported. The Bitcoin Core team believes that it is not their place to police this issue and there are only a small number of people running XP, who have systems powerful enough to run Bitcoin Core and use the wallet functionality.</p>
