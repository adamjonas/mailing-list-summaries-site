    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of Windows has been a concern even during its support period, with only a few days in the year when it is not vulnerable to outstanding known remote root compromise or user compromise plus privilege escalation. The addition of phishing, watering holes, malware, and other threats means that the average Windows computer is likely to be compromised multiple times. Even if you try to secure Windows by installing updates, it may still get compromised before you can complete the process. Experts suggest that XP is no longer secure enough and will quickly become extremely insecure. Hackers may analyze patches for later versions of Windows to find vulnerabilities that still exist in XP.</p>
