    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context revolves around the discussion on the goal of a network where transaction submitters consider their transactions to be unchangeable and the network's goal is to confirm only transactions that have not yet been seen in a final transaction's input. Tom Harding believes that such a network has a chance to succeed. However, someone disagrees with him and says that the goal of miners is to maximize profits, not to follow altruistic motives. According to this person, if enabling replace-by-fee can help miners to maximize profits, they will do it without any consideration for altruism.</p>
