    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 2, 2014, Kevin shared a link to a project he was working on which he had forked from Bitcoin Core. However, the link he provided was incorrect and seemed to point to a phishing site. Some members of the Bitcoin community were skeptical of Kevin's intentions. Laszlo Hanyecz suggested that Kevin may have accidentally linked to a phishing site and provided a different URL. Later, Jud pointed out that Kevin was probably trying to point them to his fork for comments, which was located at <a href="https://github.com/kjsisco/bitcoin/tree/patch-1">https://github.com/kjsisco/bitcoin/tree/patch-1</a>. Kevin defended himself, stating that he would never set up a phishing site and that his project was a serious one. He also mentioned that he had forked correctly and would register a domain to get a page going and link from there. Ricardo Filipe requested the correct URL of Kevin's project, but it seems that the issue was resolved with the correct link being provided by Jud.</p>
