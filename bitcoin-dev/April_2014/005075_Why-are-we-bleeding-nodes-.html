    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on April 7, 2014, Gregory Maxwell and Mark Friedenbach discussed the resource requirements of running a full node for Bitcoin. While discussing the implementation issues that prevent people from running full nodes, they highlighted the importance of distinguishing between things that can be fixed through improvements to the code base versus those that require changes to goals or incentives. The resource requirements of running a full node were identified as an issue due to the indirect consequences of not having headers first and the parallel fetch. One individual expressed concern about the amount of electricity required to run a node at home but noted that they had a Webfaction account. No further context was provided.</p>
