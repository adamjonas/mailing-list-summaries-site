    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 30, 2014, Tier Nolan created a BIP for cross-chain atomic transfers due to popular demand. The BIP proposes a sequence of signing transactions labeled as TX0, TX1, and TX2, which requires both parties to sign before the transaction can be completed. However, there are concerns about the feasibility of this proposal, especially since either party could walk away or hold the funds hostage after TX0 is signed but before TX2 is signed. Additionally, the purpose of OP_EQUAL_VERIFY in TX4 is unclear. Nolan's suggestion to use JSON-RPC for negotiation and compressed keys to discourage the use of uncompressed ones is also under consideration. Finally, it is suggested that there should be separate BIPs for the exchange itself and the protocol to negotiate the exchange.</p>
