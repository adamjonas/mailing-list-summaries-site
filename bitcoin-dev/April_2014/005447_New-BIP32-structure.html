    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Pavol Rusnak and Luke-Jr discuss the idea of scanning all possible branches for UTXOs in a wallet. Luke-Jr suggests that it should scan all possible branches regardless of which features it supports, to which Pavol Rusnak raises concerns about showing balances but not allowing users to spend them. Luke-Jr explains that by scanning all branches for UTXOs, the balance for the wallet can be obtained. The wallet must define a more detailed file format if account restoration is needed. In another message, Luke-Jr disagrees with Tamas Blummer's claim that the wallet needs to know how it got the UTXO in order to be able to spend it. Just the assigned scriptPubKey and secret(s) required to satisfy it are necessary. Although knowing the address used to receive it is logically the same as knowing which key coordinate to use, once an address becomes a UTXO, its address is no longer relevant.</p>
