    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list focused on the use of "bits" as a unit of account in Bitcoin wallets. Some participants argued that "xbit" is no more distinct or intuitive than "µbit", and that the µ adds additional meaning that is lost with the x. Additionally, there were concerns about the overuse of the word "bit", which could be solved by using µBTC instead. It was noted that the display in software does not require concern for pronunciation or nicknames, as people will adjust to the new order of magnitude even if they do not know specifically what µ means. Nicknames will form organically, and suggestions for mBTC and µBTC included milly/millie and mike/micky, respectively. The consensus was that there is no good reason to code a nickname like "bit", "xbit", or "mike" into wallet software.</p>
