    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Bitcoin developers, Wladimir proposed the idea of adding an option to popular Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, to spin a bitcoind process in the background. The decrease in the number of full nodes running Bitcoin Core as the wallet could have several reasons, including that other wallets are getting ahead in both features and useability. As a result, the number of full nodes decreases despite many people who would support the network by running a full node but don't want to go through the trouble of installing Bitcoin Core separately and getting confused because it's a wallet too. By adding this option, SPV wallets can show statistics about the node while syncing in the background, without being dependent on it. In exchange, the user would get increased security, as the SPV wallet would have a local trusted node. Bitcoin Core could help to accommodate this "embedded" usage by providing specific interfaces, special builds, or maybe even adding a walletless bitcoind build to gitian, bindings, dlls, etc.</p>
