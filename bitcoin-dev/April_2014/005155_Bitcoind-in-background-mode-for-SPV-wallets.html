    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2014, Tamas Blummer stated that the SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) is a sufficient API to a trusted node to build sophisticated features that are not offered by the core. SPV clients of the border router can build their own archive and indices based on their interest in the chain, which means that the border router core does not need to store anything unnecessary for consensus. This results in the memory and disk footprint of the border router being as low as the optimal storage of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). The exchange also mentions that storing zero full blocks does nothing to aid the network.</p>
