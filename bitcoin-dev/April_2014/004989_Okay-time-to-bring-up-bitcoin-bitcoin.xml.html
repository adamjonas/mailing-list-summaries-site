    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Jeff Garzik and Laszlo Hanyecz are discussing a link shared by Kevin regarding a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin. However, Jeff Garzik thinks that the URL provided is not a good choice and it looks like a phishing attempt. Laszlo Hanyecz thinks that perhaps the website serves up exploits selectively. Kevin defends his project, stating that it is serious and he is a big believer in Bitcoin. He also explains that he chose the URL because he wanted it connected with the core. Despite some concerns raised by others, he invites an open dialog about his project. The conversation takes place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
