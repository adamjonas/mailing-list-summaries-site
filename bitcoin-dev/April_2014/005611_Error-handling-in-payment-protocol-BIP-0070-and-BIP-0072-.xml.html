    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about payment requests, Ross Nicoll expressed caution regarding the security implications of embedding files into the payment request. He noted that even file formats that are presumed safe, such as images, have had security issues in the past. Mike Hearn responded by pointing out that PaymentRequests are limited to 50,000 bytes and that he couldn't think of a reason why payment messages would need to be any bigger than that. While it might be nice to have images and other visual elements in payment requests to make UIs look prettier, the current size limit should be sufficient. In the longer term, Ross suggested embedding the PaymentRequest directly into web pages via the <object> tag, which could eliminate the need for BIP0072 and potentially improve user interface integration. However, this would require browser plugins. It's important to keep in mind that links don't always come embedded in html and that native mobile apps also need to be considered in discussions about payment requests.</p>
