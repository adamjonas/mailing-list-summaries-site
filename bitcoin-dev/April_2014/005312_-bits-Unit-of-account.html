    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about finding a culturally neutral term for smaller units of Bitcoin. The discussion involves avoiding any cultural references in the name of the unit, such as "satoshi," which is a common Japanese name and would be a reference to Japanese culture. The idea of using the term "bit" is brought up, but it is pointed out that this word phonetically collides with slang for phallus in French and means louse in Turkish. It is suggested that terms for smaller units of Bitcoin will arise naturally as the currency becomes more commonly used. The email includes a link to download a free book on graph databases and information on how to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
