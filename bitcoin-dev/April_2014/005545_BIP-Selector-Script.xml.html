    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) allows spenders to choose one of multiple standard scripts to use for spending the output. This is required as part of the atomic cross chain transfer protocol so that outputs can be retrieved if the process ends before being committed. The script allows for multiple standard scripts to be included in the scriptPubKey, and when redeeming the script, the spender indicates which of the standard scripts to use. Only one standard script is executed, so the extra cost is just the storage required. A more ambitious change would be a soft fork like P2SH, except the spender is allowed to select from multiple hashes, effectively making it "Multi-P2SH". This would provide many benefits, similar to MAST, but would require a formal soft fork to implement. If there is agreement, the reference implementation could be coded up as a PR, and multi-P2SH might actually be easier to implement.</p>
