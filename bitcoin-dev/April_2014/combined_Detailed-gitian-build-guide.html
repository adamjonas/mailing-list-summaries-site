        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a conversation between Wladimir and Miron/devrandom, the topic of discussion is building a basic virtual machine using Gitian for gitian builds. Devrandom asks if the process can be scripted, to which Wladimir replies that it can probably be done using vmbuilder or vagrant, as suggested by Nick Simpson. However, the purpose of providing exact steps is to allow anyone to follow them without needing scripting languages. The aim is to avoid ending up with a gitian-builder-that-builds-a-gitian-builder. While some parts may be scripted, Wladimir hopes that over time, Gitian itself will become easier to use and set up, requiring fewer steps. The ultimate goal is to make it easier for newcomers to get started with Gitian.In an email exchange between Wladimir and devrandom, Wladimir provides instructions on creating a basic virtual machine for gitian builds. The emphasis is on providing an exact guide that anyone can follow without scripting. Although automation is possible for certain aspects, Wladimir hopes that Gitian will improve in usability, reducing the number of steps needed.On April 2, 2014, Wladimir announces that he is working on a guide to install and set up a Debian VM for gitian building. The purpose of this guide is to simplify the process for people getting started with gitian builds. Wladimir shares the link to the rendered version of the guide on Github and invites comments and patches. He also encourages anyone facing problems while following the guide to inform him. Miron responds to Wladimir's email expressing admiration.Wladimir's guide aims to assist people in installing and setting up a Debian VM for gitian building. This guide can be used on any operating system that has VirtualBox. The intention behind this guide is to make it easier for individuals to begin with gitian builds. The rendered version of the guide can be found at <a href="https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/blob/2014_04_debian_gitian_build_doc/doc/gitian-building.md">https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/blob/2014_04_debian_gitian_build_doc/doc/gitian-building.md</a>. Feedback and contributions in the form of comments and patches are welcome, and users are encouraged to inform Wladimir if they encounter any issues while following the guide.</p>
