    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, Mike Hearn argues against the suggestion that miners be paid more for not being corrupt, insisting that they are already well-compensated. Instead, he proposes that miners who are not doing their jobs correctly should have any money they claim via coinbases taken back or destroyed. He also suggests that maliciously double-spending miners cannot justify their existence and do not deserve compensation. The message goes on to state that the integrity of Bitcoin is more important than individual preferences and that nobody has the right to decide which valid scripts in the blockchain will be disregarded. The sole purpose of the network is to enforce what is written in the blockchain. Finally, the message encourages using email encryption for online privacy and provides a link to learn how to use it.</p>
