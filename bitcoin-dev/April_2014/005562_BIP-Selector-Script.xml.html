    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Luke-Jr and another individual revolves around the standardization of interoperability between software in Bitcoin. While each miner could theoretically decide their own inclusion rules, in practice most miners would accept transactions that are updated in the reference client. The malleability issue has been known for years, but it is possible to tweak the protocol to work with 3rd parties. There is ongoing discussion of a softfork to redo the Script language, which will take time and development before implementation. Luke-Jr also questions the assignment of BIP numbers and suggests keeping them numberless until assigned to avoid confusion when searching.</p>
