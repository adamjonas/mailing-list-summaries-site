    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the issue of network performance and how it can be improved. Matt Whitlock suggests that the real problem lies with people not knowing how to configure their routers correctly. He mentions that Bitcoind only saturates the upstream link when he tries to transfer a file using SCP from a computer on his home network to a computer out on the Internet somewhere. This is because the router interprets the "maximize throughput" flag in the IP "type of service" field as meaning low priority, causing the SCP transfers to get stalled behind Bitcoind. However, other activities such as email, web browsing, instant messaging, and SSH show no degradation whatsoever regardless of what Bitcoind is doing. Matt suggests that the packet queue should be moved from the cable modem into the router where intelligent decisions about packet priority and reordering can be enacted to improve network performance. He also mentions that ÂµTP reinvents the wheel and does so in userspace where the overhead is greater. He believes that there's no need for it if proper quality of service (QoS) is in effect. The conversation highlights the importance of configuring routers correctly for optimal network performance.</p>
