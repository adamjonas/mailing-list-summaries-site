    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on April 23, 2014, Gregory Maxwell and Pavol Rusnak discussed the matter of funds being split across two wallets. Gregory expressed that it would be better if the split was not done silently so that users could have a better experience when spending their funds. However, Pavol disagreed, stating that it makes perfect sense for funds across accounts to never mix. He believes that a consistent user experience can still be achieved by sending funds from one account to another before performing another spend. To him, this is what accounts are for, and he compares it to how classic bank accounts work. He asked whether anyone has ever done one transaction from two bank accounts simultaneously.</p>
