    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the maintenance of namecoin and how it compares to the proposed distributed ledger for a device. The practical considerations of synchronizing the chain in a low bandwidth environment without direct internet access, pre-loading the chain at the factory, and the risks associated with it were addressed. It was felt that getting the proposed distributed ledger to work properly at the lowest common denominator level would make everything else easier. The Bitcoin software using a second blockchain, like namecoin, was not seen as necessary for providing safe communication of a non-face-to-face, person-to-person, pay-to address. Instead, a standard equivalent to BIP70 for this use case is expected to emerge. The inclusion of all incumbent coin stuff just to arrive at a distributed ledger for a set of ultimately disposable keys did not make sense when considering why a reward is needed for a ledger of information and confirmation time when no money is at risk.</p>
