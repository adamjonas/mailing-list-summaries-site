    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author expresses concern about losing intra-client HD compatibility for BIP32 wallets, which could result in vendor lock-in and a disservice to users. In an effort to avoid this situation, the author suggests creating an "HD Basic" agreement, which would allow for interoperability among entry-level users and keep things simple. However, using anything advanced would result in being locked into a specific wallet. The author acknowledges that standardizing everything is difficult but stresses the importance of at least having a minimum level of interoperability. In response to this concern, Andreas Schildbach proposes removing the "wallet structure" part of the BIP32 document and instead pointing to BIP43, which defines a "purpose" and allows standardization to evolve naturally over time. The author offers to submit a pull request if there is a level of consent from others.</p>
