    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In April 2014, Mike Hearn wrote about a strange incident regarding a transaction that was accepted into the block chain 15 blocks ago, but they couldn't get anything to accept it again. They had been trying to get a 2-of-3 to be accepted for hours, and every attempt was rejected by Coinb.in, their local Bitcoind, and the Eligius tx push form. It seemed that something had already accepted the transaction without their knowledge. They were starting over again and attempting to reproduce the success or failure of the transaction.</p>
