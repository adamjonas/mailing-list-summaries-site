    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context is about the possibility of a fixed range for nodes that host all history, which could be useful when these types of nodes become rare. The idea is to burn the node implementation, block data, and live operating system on a read-only medium, which would allow distributing 'pieces of history' in a self-contained form. There wouldn't be any consensus code to keep up to date with protocol developments because it wouldn't take an active part in it. While it may not be useful right now, it could be in the future. Peer selection would involve seeking nodes that have the least rarity in the ranges they offer, rather than preferring to fetch blocks from someone with a large range if it's only one of 100 nodes that has that range. In general, it would be best to request blocks from a node that serves the last N (N>~50) blocks, rather than a history node that could use the same bandwidth to serve earlier, rarer blocks to others.</p>
