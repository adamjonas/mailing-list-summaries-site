    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of the term 'bit' is not universal and can be confused with other meanings. Chris Pacia argues that it is primarily a techy term and not commonly used in daily life, but he sees it as a fitting unit for money since it was previously used as a unit of currency. However, Wladimir points out that this view is anglocentric and in the Netherlands, 'bit' refers to an object placed in a horse's mouth. The term has also been adopted as an imported word for information. It appears that the use of the term 'bit' is dependent on cultural context and may not have a universal meaning.</p>
