    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 9, 2014, Tamas Blummer wrote that block headers have to be available in Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and an UTXO only storing the core node. He suggested serving any additional information like known peer addresses or known full blocks if the bandwidth allows it. There are big security advantages of passing around block headers and full blocks. For instance, if an attacker hacks a percentage of hashing power, the next step for them to attack SPV clients is to try to Sybil attack them, so they won't find out about the longer chain. The fewer providers of blockchain data there are, the easier that attack is. Similarly, by passing around full blocks, the attacker has a harder time knocking other miners off the network. Regardless of whether or not a miner's peers are fully validating chain data, they still have the data they need to mine the next block and thus extend the longest correct chain.</p>
