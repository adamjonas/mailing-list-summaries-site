    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Pieter Wuille and Kevin on April 16, 2014, the topic of XP's security was discussed. Pieter responded to Kevin's question regarding whether or not XP is secure enough by simply stating "Yes." He then went on to explain that since support for XP had ended, it would quickly become extremely insecure. With no more updates or patches being released, people would be actively analyzing patches for post-XP versions to find security problems that are patched there, in order to see if they could be exploited on XP. Wladimir also participated in the email chain.</p>
