    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Mike Hearn sent an email on April 15, 2014, to the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding a rejected transaction. He advised checking the debug.log for the reason behind its rejection. The rejection was due to the first input being spent by another transaction that looked very similar. Furthermore, Mike suggested that version 0.9 should report a more detailed reason for rejections. In addition, Mike's email contained a link to a free O'Reilly book called "Graph Databases," which is a guide to graph databases and their applications. The book was written by three leaders in the field and was available for download at the time.</p>
