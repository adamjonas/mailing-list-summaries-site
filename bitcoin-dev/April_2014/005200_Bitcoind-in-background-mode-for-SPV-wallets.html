    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 10, 2014, Pieter Wuille initiated a discussion on the topic of indicating the availability of blocks. Two possible solutions were presented: using one or a few service bits to indicate block availability or extending addr messages with flags to show this information. Wuille suggested a hybrid approach where bits could indicate the general degree of block availability, but the actual availability would only be shown upon connecting through a "version" extension or a separate message. This is because the actual blocks available are likely to change frequently, and their availability is not that important for peer selection. A commenter proposed putting an expiration date on the information and delaying deletion until the expiration is reached. Additionally, it was noted that the node bit solution could be done as a gradual upgrade path for SPV clients. From the perspective of nodes that do not know about it, they would see pruned nodes as SPV nodes without any chain data at all. However, the potential issue is if large numbers of users turned off their full nodes, but this is a possibility regardless. Done with partial UTXO set mode, this may even result in an eventual increase in the number of full nodes.</p>
