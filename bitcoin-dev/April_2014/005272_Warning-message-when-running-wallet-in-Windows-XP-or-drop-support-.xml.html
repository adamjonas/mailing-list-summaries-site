    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Gregory Maxwell and Wladimir on April 17, 2014, the topic of internet banking with Windows XP being no longer secure enough was discussed. Wladimir also mentioned that running a wallet in Windows XP would not be secure enough, except for nodes without keys to protect. Gregory responded by saying that multi-wallet support would eventually make it so that a wallet wouldn't be created by default. Instead, users would create a wallet which would give them options like using a hardware security module (HSM) or multisig secured wallet. However, HSMs complicate this process, and it is unclear how Trezor plans to contribute support for their device to wallets including Bitcoin Core. After the wallet split-off, there will be two different options: Bitcoin Core Node and Bitcoin Core Wallet. The node would be as compatible as possible with any operating system, but the wallet can be more selective.</p>
