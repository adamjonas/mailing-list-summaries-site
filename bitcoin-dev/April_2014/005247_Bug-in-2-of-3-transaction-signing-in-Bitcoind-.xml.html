    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on April 15th, 2014 at 6:39 pm, Chris Beams asked if the source was available for a tool that could encode, decode, hash, and derive keys from stdin or octets. The author of the tool replied that their intent was to open-source it but would only do so when they are confident that all the kinks have been worked out. The tool had various functionalities such as encoding and decoding in hex, Base64, and Base58Check, disassembling hex script, hashing using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, deriving private and public keys, deriving an address from a public key, encrypting and decrypting private keys per BIP38, distributing private keys into m-of-n shares, reconstituting private keys by joining shares, deriving k private keys, public keys, addresses, and m-of-n P2SH addresses from public seeds. The author also created a tool named chaintool that can initialize a new cache file, add a public key or seed, remove a public key or seed, list public keys and seeds, synchronize with the blockchain, get available balance, list unspent outputs in JSON, create a transaction from address+amount pairs on stdin, and sign a transaction with private key(s)/seed(s).</p>
