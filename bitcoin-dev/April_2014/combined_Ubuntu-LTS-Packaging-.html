        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Oliver Egginger reached out to Matt Corallo on April 12th, 2014 regarding an issue with his dynamically-linked-to-openssl builds. Matt responded by stating that the version of 0.9.1 was up to date and did not change anything for these builds. Oliver apologized for the trouble and expressed gratitude for Matt's assistance.In an email exchange on the same day, Oliver inquired about updates regarding a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management on Ubuntu LTS basis. He provided a link to the Bitcoin Launchpad page and mentioned that he decided to maintain his own repository for the project due to the need for timely updates, particularly for critical vulnerabilities. Luke clarified that the mailing list is for development purposes only and suggested that the latest relevant version for packaging is 0.9.0, which can be found in the PPA that Oliver linked.Oliver also inquired about any updates regarding Bitcoin and shared a link to the official website. Wladimir replied that the only alteration in version 0.9.1 was OpenSSL's dependency version used in the binary gitian builds. However, the PPA build is reliant on the operating system OpenSSL, so upgrading it should suffice.In summary, Oliver Egginger is developing a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management based on Ubuntu LTS. He is looking for timely updates to address critical vulnerabilities. To do this, he has decided to maintain his own repository for the project. Oliver has shared a link to his project on Launchpad and is open to suggestions for better alternatives.</p>
