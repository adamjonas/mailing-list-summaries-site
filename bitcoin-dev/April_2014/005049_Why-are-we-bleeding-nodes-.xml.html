    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In April 2014, Mike Hearn raised concerns about the decreasing number of Bitcoin nodes, which had fallen from 10,000 to 8,500 in just two months. He cited various reasons why people might stop running a node, including disk space usage, bandwidth limitations, or loss of interest. However, Hearn was interested in gaining more insight into what was happening. He suggested that if the subVer included the operating system, they could tell whether the decrease was from desktops/laptops or virtual servers, which would be more concerning. Hearn also proposed an exit survey to gather information on why operators stopped running their nodes. This survey would be similar to the Tor project's email system, where users can receive updates and notifications sent by the Tor project. If a node disappeared for long enough, an email could be sent to the operator asking them why they stopped running their node. The discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, which is hosted by SourceForge. In addition to Hearn's proposals, the email also included a link to a Jenkins Continuous Integration tool for developers to try out.</p>
