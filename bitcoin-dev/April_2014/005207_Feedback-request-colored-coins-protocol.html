    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the concern with requiring a large BTC capital for issuing coloring coins. The sender is modifying the specification to address it and will post an update when finished. The proposed solution is to encode the asset quantity of every output in the OP_RETURN output. This way, whether one is issuing 1 share or 100 trillion shares, they never need to pay more than 540 satoshis. The recipient of the email argues that using padding is still quite simple, and there are only a few extra lines of code required to handle it. He suggests that it solves the problem once and for all, whereas the proposed solution would create inconvenience for end-users. He also points out that creating different denominations of colored coins would be much more complex and wouldn't work practically.</p>
