    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the main.cpp file, there is a function called ProcessMessage(). Within this function, there is a line of code that checks whether the size of a vector called vAddr is equal to 1000. If it is, then the function will return. The question being asked is whether it is possible for the variable pfrom->fGetAddr to be true only if the size of vAddr is 1000.However, the answer to this specific question could not be found in the list archive. It is unclear what the purpose of pfrom->fGetAddr is or how it relates to the size of the vAddr vector. It may be necessary to look at other parts of the code or consult with other developers to determine the answer to this question.Overall, it seems that there is a concern about the behavior of the ProcessMessage() function and how it interacts with the vAddr vector and the pfrom->fGetAddr variable. Further investigation may be needed to fully understand the issue and find a solution.</p>
