    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core developer, Mike Hearn, believes that optimising Bitcoin's usage on servers will create a better user experience for desktop users as well. Home environments are more hostile than servers due to various factors, such as virus scanners and asymmetrical upstream versus downstream bandwidth; therefore, improving memory and disk usage would benefit both server and desktop users. Additionally, given the decline of desktop tower machines in favour of laptops, Hearn believes it is not worth spending precious coding hours trying to improve Bitcoin's performance on desktops. Another issue discussed was the fundamental incompatibility between wallets and nodes; wallets need to be online for as little time as possible, whereas nodes should be online as much as possible. A full node background process could run if the wallet is closed, but a general solution is needed to encourage people to run a node when their wallet is not running. One suggestion was to create a separate 'node control' user interface instead of packaging it with wallets.</p>
