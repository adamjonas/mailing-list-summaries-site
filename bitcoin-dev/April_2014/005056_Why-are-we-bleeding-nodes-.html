    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email from April 7th, 2014, Mike Hearn reported that the number of Bitcoin nodes had drastically decreased from 10,000 at the beginning of February to 8,500 and still continuing to fall. This decline was not unexpected as even a few months prior to this, the bitnodes count indicated an even lower number of nodes. It is worth noting that Bitcoin.org has recommended against running Bitcoin-QT, which may be contributing to the decrease in nodes. Overall, it seems that the declining trend in Bitcoin nodes should not come as a surprise given these factors.</p>
