    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated April 7, 2014, Justus Ranvier discusses the increasing resource requirements of a full node in the Bitcoin network. He argues that while it may be true that these requirements are becoming too much for casual users, this is not necessarily a problem. Ranvier compares the situation to other tasks that most people do not do themselves, such as growing their own food or making their own clothes.Currently, running a full node in the Bitcoin network requires about $1 of disk space and costs only a few cents per month in power. Despite this, Ranvier acknowledges that there are still issues to be addressed. However, he challenges the notion that resource requirements are beyond the capabilities of casual users and asks for evidence to support this claim.</p>
