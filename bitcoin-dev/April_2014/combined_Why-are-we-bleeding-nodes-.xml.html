        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread from April 7th, 2014, various individuals discussed the issue of Bitcoin nodes. Tamas Blummer questioned whether a Bitcoin-QT block that had a transaction pruned would still be eligible to be served to other nodes. Mike Hearn disputed this, stating that pruning can work happily on a whole block at a time basis regardless of whether all transactions in it are spent or not. Mark Friedenbach stated that the current issue with running a full node on a home DSL connection was an implementation issue and not a requirements issue. Jameson Lopp agreed and suggested that more information was needed to determine how many nodes are needed.In the same email thread, Tamas Blummer asked about agreeing on service bits for an archive node, but there were concerns that a binary archive bit would cause extreme load hot-spotting. It was suggested that it would be better to extend the addr messages so that nodes could indicate a range of blocks they're serving, allowing all nodes to contribute fractionally according to their means. Finally, Jameson Lopp mentioned the Bitnodes project's updated counting algorithm and questioned how many nodes we really need.The number of full nodes is not important as long as it satisfies the demand by other nodes. What is important is how hard it is to run one and verify that no one is cheating on the network without significant investment. The number of Bitcoin nodes has been steadily decreasing since the start of February, with less than 8500 nodes now. However, some dispute this, claiming higher numbers. Regardless, running a full node consumes about $1 in disk space and costs a couple of cents in power per month, which does not make the resource requirements beyond the capabilities of casual users. Nonetheless, Bitcoin.org recommends people away from running Bitcoin-QT.</p>
