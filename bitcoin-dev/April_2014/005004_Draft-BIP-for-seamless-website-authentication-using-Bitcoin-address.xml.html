    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has created a draft BIP description of an authentication protocol based on Bitcoin public address. The aim is to prove that a specific Bitcoin address belongs to the user by signing a challenge, and securely link all related data and settings to the session. This protocol could greatly facilitate sign-ups and logins to services and applications, improving the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. Classical password authentication is insecure and can be solved with public key cryptography. However, managing private keys securely is complex, but this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The author has formatted the protocol description as a BIP so that all major wallets can implement it. The demo website for this protocol can be found at <a href="http://bitid-demo.herokuapp.com/">http://bitid-demo.herokuapp.com/</a>. The author invites readers to provide feedback to improve the draft.</p>
