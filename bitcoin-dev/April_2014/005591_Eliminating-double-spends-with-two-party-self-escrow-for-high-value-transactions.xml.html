    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2014, Mike Hearn proposed a mechanism for Bitcoin transactions that involved the use of an escrow service. The concern raised was that buyers could continuously request refunds, but Hearn explained that sellers would only release goods once they had received a valid transaction signed by the buyer sending them the escrowed funds. He also noted that his proposal was similar to Jeremy Spilman's micropayment channel and provided a link to the relevant post. There was no further discussion on the topic in the email thread.</p>
