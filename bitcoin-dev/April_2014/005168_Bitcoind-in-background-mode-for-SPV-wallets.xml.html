    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 9th April 2014, Wladimir proposed an idea aimed at developers of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets. He noted that the decrease in the number of full nodes could be due to less people running Bitcoin Core for the wallet since other wallets are getting ahead in features and usability. Although it's great to see innovation in wallets, the reduction in the number of full nodes is worrying. Therefore, he suggested exploring the idea of adding an option to popular SPV wallets to spin a bitcoind process in the background. This would be transparent to the user as it would sync in the background, and the wallet could show statistics about the node, but isn't dependent on it. The user would get increased security since the SPV wallet would have a local trusted node.Wladimir asked if there were specific interfaces, special builds, or bindings that Bitcoin Core can help to accommodate this 'embedded' usage. Kevin expressed interest in the idea and questioned whether it would involve a flag that could toggle this "in the background" mode or recoding for in the background use.</p>
