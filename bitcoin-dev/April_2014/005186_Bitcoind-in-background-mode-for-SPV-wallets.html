    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Wladimir J. van der Laan, the topic of discussion is the usage incompatibility between wallets and nodes. Hearn suggests that the main constraint with home devices is not their actual power but rather that a lot of people no longer keep computers switched on all the time. Therefore, he proposes optimising the NAT tunneling code, adding more diagnostic stuff to the GUI, and implementing STUN support to address this issue. Van der Laan agrees with Hearn's proposal but notes that a full node background process could also be running if the wallet is not open itself by running as a system service. Bitcoin Core's own wallet is also moving to SPV, so a general solution is needed to get people to run a node when the wallet is not running. He suggests that maybe the node shouldn't be controlled from the wallet at all and could be a 'node control' user interface on its own. In this case, there is no need for packaging it with a wallet. However, initially, people wouldn't know why or when to install this, which is why Van der Laan suggests packing it with wallets.</p>
