    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the possibility of deleting or reallocating coinbases to discourage double spending. The original idea was to delete the coinbases, but some people argued against destroying money and suggested reallocation instead. The question of whether deletion or reallocation is better remains open. The proposal of using this mechanism to claw back mining income from a hardware vendor accused of violating agreements on self-mining seems impractical without a way to identify blocks mined with pre-sold equipment. However, it should be possible to reliably identify blocks that are Finney attacking for profit. Despite the dire pool situation, a significant amount of mining hash power today is still effectively anonymous.</p>
