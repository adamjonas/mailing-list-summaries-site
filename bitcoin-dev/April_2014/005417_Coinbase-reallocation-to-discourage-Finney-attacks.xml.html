    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-development list, Peter Todd suggested that important protocol changes should be discussed publicly. He argued that a development list is an excellent place to decide how to implement a technical feature once it has been determined to be desirable. There are also conferences where people can announce ideas and get feedback from the community. Todd believes there is nothing so urgent about the recent double-spending attack that requires the consensus process to start in a place that most Bitcoin users don't even know about. Additionally, Todd corrected himself when he stated that they did not know who ran BitUndo, a company that was responsible for the recent double-spending attack. He provided a link to CoinDesk's article, which identified Eric Springer as the owner of BitUndo, and a link to his GitHub account. Todd acknowledged that the website was built using Twitter Bootstrap or something similar, and that wizards could create a site like that in a few hours. The email ended with Todd encouraging the use of email encryption to support online privacy.</p>
