    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The website www.githubb.com is associated with the IP addresses announced by AS53665. This Autonomous System (AS) does not have an IRR record for their AS or their only route, and they most likely have a dedicated server or VPS at Cogent. According to Google's Safe Browsing Diagnostic, AS53665 is a malware site. On April 1, 2014, Kevin shared a link to www.githubb.com/bitcoin/bitcoin on the Bitcoin development mailing list. He claimed to have forked it from Bitcoin Core and was working on a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin. However, Jeff Garzik, who replied to Kevin, believed that this URL was a poor choice and could be a phishing attempt that nobody should visit. Laszlo Hanyecz suggested that maybe the site serves up exploits selectively, and whoever is the target probably gets something special.Kevin insisted that his project was serious and held water, but he acknowledged that the good, the bad, and the ugly would come out of it. He expressed his belief in Bitcoin and invited open dialogue about his project.</p>
