    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 9, 2014, Tamas Blummer wrote that a border router not being able to serve blocks still protects consensus rules that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) does not. A majority coalition of miners could increase their reward if the network only consisted of SPV nodes. However, any collective group with hashing power will have no major issues running enough nodes that follow their rules to make SPV insecure anyway.There is no good reason not to have SPV security nodes distribute blockchain data, especially block headers. It helps provide redundancy in the network topology and resources for full nodes to sync up faster. In a network with many partial UTXO set nodes, forwarding block data can help them become fully fledged full nodes without putting all the load on existing full nodes.</p>
