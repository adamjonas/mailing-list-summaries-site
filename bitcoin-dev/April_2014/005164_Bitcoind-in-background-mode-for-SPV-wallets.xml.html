    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Tamas Blummer and Peter Todd, Blummer suggests that a border router that cannot serve blocks can still protect consensus rules that SPVs do not. However, if the network only consists of SPV nodes, a majority coalition of miners could increase their reward at will. Todd argues that there is no good reason why SPV security nodes should not distribute blockchain data, particularly block headers, as it helps provide redundancy in the network topology and more resources for full nodes to sync up faster. This would be beneficial in a network with a large number of partial UTXO set nodes, as they can become fully fledged full nodes without putting all the load on existing full nodes. Additionally, serving any additional information such as known peer addresses or known full blocks would be beneficial if bandwidth allows.</p>
