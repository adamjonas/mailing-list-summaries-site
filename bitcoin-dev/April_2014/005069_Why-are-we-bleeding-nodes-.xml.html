    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>One of the major issues for casual users who run a node at home is bandwidth. Jameson, an expert in this field, considers it as the most important issue. Setting up QoS rules requires technical knowledge which most casual users lack. As a result, they get annoyed when their Internet connection is slowed down. A discussion was held on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2014 about the resource requirements of running a full node. Justus Ranvier had argued that these requirements were moving beyond the capabilities of casual users but Gregory Maxwell disagreed and asked for a citation to support that claim. He stated that running a full node currently costs around $1 in disk space and a few cents in power per month. While he acknowledged that there were issues, he did not agree that the requirements were beyond the capabilities of casual users. The email also included a promotion for Jenkins Continuous Integration, a tool for automating build, test, and deployment processes.</p>
