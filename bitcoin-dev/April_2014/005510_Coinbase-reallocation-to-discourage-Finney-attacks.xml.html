    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn and Peter Todd discussed the idea of clawing back mining income from a hardware vendor who violated agreements on self-mining/mining on customers' hardware. However, identifying blocks that were mined with pre-sold equipment would be difficult unless there was a way to do so. Deleting/stealing coinbases of miners who don't identify themselves might be effective but it's not possible to produce a cryptographic proof that a given block engaged in a Finney attack. Another possible outcome could be for coinbase blacklisting to be used to force a minority of miners to adopt a transaction blacklist that the majority of miners had adopted. The mechanism proposed is simply a way of voting on what coinbases to either blacklist or reallocate.</p>
