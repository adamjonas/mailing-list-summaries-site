    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on April 23, 2014, Luke-Jr and Tamas Blummer discussed the functionality of a wallet. Luke-Jr stated that any wallet should be able to import all coins but would not use any account other than 0, and once the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) were in the wallet, they would no longer be associated with the address or any other details of how they were received. Tamas disagreed, stating that the wallet would need to know how it received the UTXO in order to spend it. Luke-Jr retorted that the wallet only needed to know the assigned scriptPubKey and secret(s) required to satisfy it, not necessarily the original address. However, Tamas argued that knowing the secret would logically require knowledge of the address used to receive it.</p>
