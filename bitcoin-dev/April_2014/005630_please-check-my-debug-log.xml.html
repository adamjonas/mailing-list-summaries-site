    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 29, 2014, Eugen Leitl put up some bitcoind nodes after the network was in need of some. He requested feedback to see if the nodes were fully operational and doing something useful. Leitl provided debug.log from a node that ran for a day and another one he just restarted. The logs show errors and warnings about transactions and connections. If nodes are left up for a while, they will start getting traffic from bitcoinj clients too.The context provided is a log of messages received by a Bitcoin node. The log shows the time, version number, number of blocks, IP addresses of the sender and receiver, as well as the peer's IP address. Some of the versions mentioned include Satoshi:0.8.5, Satoshi:0.9.0, bitcoinseeder:0.01, Dain 0.0.1, and Snoopy:0.1. Time data is also added to the log with sample numbers and offsets. The nTimeOffset is set to +0 minutes in all cases.The log ends with a message promoting automated cross-browser testing for Selenium tests and a link to sign up for free. The email also includes information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list and links to subscribe and unsubscribe.</p>
