    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Jorge Timón on 5 April 2014, the two discussed their preferences for date formats. Timón expressed his liking for both DD-MM-YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD formats but disliking MM-DD-YYYY and YYYY-DD-MM. Whitlock pointed out that Timón's preferences reflect a cultural bias. He further added that the only entirely numeric date format that is unambiguous across all cultures is YYYY-MM-DD and that no culture uses YYYY-DD-MM, or at least the ISO seems to think so. Timón acknowledged the point and noted that he probably accepted DD-MM-YYYY due to cultural bias. He also commented that the ISO YYYY-MM-DD is the most universal in addition to being standard. The conversation took place via email and can be found on Jorge Timón's website.</p>
