    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, the discussion revolved around coming up with a culturally-neutral name for a unit representing 1e-6 bitcoin. One user suggested "ubit" as it is easy to say and tied visually to the metric prefix "micro". Another user pointed out that "bit" phonetically collides with slang for phallus in French ("bitte") and means "louse" in Turkish. Additionally, they stated that all short possible words are usually taken, making it difficult to find a completely neutral name. A third user suggested that terms arise by themselves and there is no need to force a name for smaller units of bitcoin that have not yet established themselves. The discussion also included the promotion of a free book called "Graph Databases".</p>
