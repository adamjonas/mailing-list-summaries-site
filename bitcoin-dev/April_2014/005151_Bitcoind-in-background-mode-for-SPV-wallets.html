    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Natanael proposes a way to support Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients by bundling Stratum with Bitcoind. Stratum is a protocol that is already being used by Electrum and would allow SPV wallets to connect to it. However, it was pointed out that using Electrum as is would require additional indexes and preclude pruning which would increase resource utilization of the node. The suggestion was made that Stratum might be an easier way to support SPV clients than creating a new API in bitcoind since it already relies on bitcoind for its services. It was also noted that Bitcoin's own P2P protocol is already the API for an ordinary SPV client and no new API would be required except possibly for some process management stuff.</p>
