    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on April 2, 2014, Kevin requested Bitcoin developers to visit his secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin project hosted on Github. However, he mistakenly linked to a phishing site with two Bs in the URL instead of bitcoin/bitcoin on Github. The developers pointed out the issue and asked for the correct link. It is possible that Kevin did not realize that he linked to a phishing site and used speech-to-text or other assistive technology that accounted for the misspelling. It is advised to stay away from the phishing site with two Bs in the URL. Later, Kevin explained that he would register a domain for his project and create a page there to avoid confusion with the incorrect link. He emphasized that his project was serious and urged people to look at it to start an open dialog about it.</p>
