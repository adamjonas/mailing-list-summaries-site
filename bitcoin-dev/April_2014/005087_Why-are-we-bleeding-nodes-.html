    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Tamas Blummer and Gregory Maxwell, the topic of service bits for an archive node was brought up. Maxwell expressed concern that a binary archive bit would cause extreme load hot-spotting and suggested extending the addr messages so that nodes can indicate a range or two of blocks they're serving. This would allow all nodes to contribute fractionally according to their means. Currently, distributed storage is needed for the most recent blocks to prevent extreme bandwidth load on archives. Once a single transaction is pruned in a block, the block is no longer eligible to be served to other nodes. Transactions that are pruned can be customized depending on the wallet(s) of the node. Blummer suggests returning a bitmap of pruned/full blocks rather than ranges, as it may be more convenient.</p>
