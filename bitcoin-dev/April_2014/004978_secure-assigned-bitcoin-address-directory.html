    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Daryl Banttari posted code on Reddit suggesting a simple x509 digital signature to a Bitcoin address URL, allowing for an x.509 authenticated Bitcoin address without having to do a full BIP70 implementation. For added authentication, one could wrap the URL with a PGP signature. Chris D'Costa is working on a decentralized ledger of device keys that can be used for encrypting a message to an intended recipient without a third-party CA and prior dialogue. This would provide advanced knowledge of a public key that can be used for secure transmission of person-to-person pay-to addresses. The distributed ledger of device keys is referred to as the "Web-of-trust re-imagined". There is no assumed relationship between Bitcoin keys and device keys. Keys expire or may be compromised, and the public ledger needs to reflect that. The proof-of-life concept looks at the last heard from date of devices to determine which ones are expired. WoT tried to resolve fake keys issues via signing parties, or keys posted to a public forum by a known user. However, it is not a standard and not ideal.</p>
