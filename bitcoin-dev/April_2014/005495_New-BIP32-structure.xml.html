    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern that Electrum may be limiting itself with its proposed structure and that it will be unable to implement recurring payments. However, Thomas Voegtlin, the developer of Electrum, stated that it is too early to take decisions that might limit future functionality as there are still many possibilities to explore. The developer believes that it will take years to have a clear idea of what users need and how to organize everything. Voegtlin also acknowledged that it is challenging to find a consensus on wallet structure between wallet developers, and he has changed his mind several times on these questions. As a solution, he decided to include a version number in Electrum seeds that would be updated every time the wallet structure changes. Although not all developers agree with this approach, Voegtlin believes that Electrum needs it.Voegtlin thinks that it is too early to aim for inter-wallet compatibility, and it should be postponed. Instead, software releases should be moved forward. He emphasized that it is essential to ensure that an incompatible seed is not imported into another wallet as it would result in a terrible user experience. Therefore, the version number built in the seed will ensure that for Electrum.</p>
