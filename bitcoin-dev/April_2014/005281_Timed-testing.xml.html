    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and Gavin Andresen, they discussed the implementation of a new mode in Bitcoind. Timón suggested that the private mode only makes sense if it's useful enough for network attack simulations, which is still an open question. Andresen responded by proposing that the same effect could be achieved with -regtest by controlling node connectivity. He provided a simulation method where two nodes are started, connected to each other, and mine a -regtest chain they both agree on. After restarting them so they're not connected, one node mines normally while the other simulates an attack. To simulate launching the attack, they are connected together again, and the two chains compete to see what happens.</p>
