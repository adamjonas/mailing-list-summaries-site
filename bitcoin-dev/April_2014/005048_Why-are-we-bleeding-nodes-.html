    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of February, there were around 10,000 bitcoin nodes, but now it has fallen to 8,500 and still decreasing. The reasons behind this drop could be due to disk space usage, bandwidth, or lost interest in running a node. However, the author is seeking more insight into this issue and suggests that if the subVer contained the operating system, it would be easier to determine whether the decrease was mostly from desktops/laptops (Windows/Mac) or virtual servers (Linux), which would be more concerning. The author proposes a solution inspired by the Tor project where users can add their email address to the config file, and the project sends emails from time to time about things they should know about. Similarly, for Bitcoin, the author suggests having an exit survey to email operators whose nodes have disappeared for long enough. This survey will help understand why they stopped running the node.</p>
