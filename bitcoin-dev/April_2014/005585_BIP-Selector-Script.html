    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about how to change IsStandard by creating an application-oriented BIP using new standard transaction types such as hash-locked transactions. Creating a BIP detailing the applications of these transactions will allow for constructive engagement and consensus-building on the best way to implement cross-chain atomic swaps, which will then be implemented. While it is possible for miners to decide their inclusion rules for themselves, most miners will accept transactions if the reference client is updated. However, submitting changes as a pull request for the reference client would increase the odds of it being accepted. There is ongoing discussion of a softfork to redo the Script language entirely, but it will take significant time and development before it is seen in the wild. The implementation of multi-P2SH gets many benefits of MAST in terms of efficiency. Finally, the BIP editor has not assigned numbers yet, and it is recommended to keep them numberless until assigned to avoid confusion when people Google the real BIP 44 and 45.</p>
