    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitnodes project updated their counting algorithm a month ago, which made it more accurate and faster. Prior to the update, it was reporting over 100,000 nodes. However, according to Gregory Maxwell, a few months before that, the count was less than 8,500 and had been falling consistently since the bitcoin.org change. The old bitnodes.io data is no longer available, so he is going off his memory. It is worth noting that the Bitnodes counts have always been higher than Gregory Maxwell's or sipa's node counts. This email was sent on the Bitcoin-development mailing list by Gregory Maxwell on April 7, 2014. The email focused on the Bitnodes project's counting algorithm and how it compared to other node counts. Additionally, the email included an advertisement for Jenkins Continuous Integration, encouraging developers to start a new project with it in the cloud.</p>
