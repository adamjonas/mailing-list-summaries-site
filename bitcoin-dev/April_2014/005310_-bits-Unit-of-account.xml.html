    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The word "bit" in English is commonly used as a term for a unit of digital currency. However, the word has cultural connotations that may not be neutral across all languages. In French, the phonetic pronunciation of "bit" collides with slang for phallus, and in Turkish, it means "louse." Despite this, finding a culturally neutral short word for a unit of digital currency may be difficult as most short words have already been taken. A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list named Oliver Egginger wrote in 2014 that he did not see a problem with there not being a term for smaller units of bitcoin yet as the currency was still primarily being used for speculation at the time. The email also included a link to a free book on graph databases.</p>
