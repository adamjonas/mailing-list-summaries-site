    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Justus Ranvier raised a point that if miners do not like a block that has been mined, they can work together to orphan it without any change in protocol. However, this requires them to establish a majority consensus and be sure it is indeed the majority. The response questioned why an out-of-band mechanism would be better than using the actual consensus mechanism. The email also mentioned that Bitcoin imposes more rules than just execution of the scripting language, some of which are arbitrary and based on human judgment, such as the inflation schedule. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that Bitcoin implements only some natural law.</p>
