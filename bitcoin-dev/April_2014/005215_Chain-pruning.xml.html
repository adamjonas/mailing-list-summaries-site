    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread from 2014, members of the Bitcoin-development mailing list discuss ways to reduce the size of the blockchain. Brian Hoffman suggests forming "superblocks" that are chained together and served by different nodes to allow participants with limited resources to serve full portions of the blockchain rather than limited pieces. However, Mike Hearn points out that the block chain is mostly random bytes and doesn't compress well enough to make a significant difference. He suggests that in the future, when the chain is truly gigantic, it could be stored on tape and spooled off at high speed. The idea of blockchain pruning is also mentioned as a potential solution. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding ways to address the scalability issues faced by the Bitcoin network due to the ever-increasing size of the blockchain.</p>
