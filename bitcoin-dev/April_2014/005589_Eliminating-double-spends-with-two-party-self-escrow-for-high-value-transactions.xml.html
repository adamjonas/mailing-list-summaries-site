    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When it comes to online shopping, one question that often arises is what stops a buyer from always requesting a refund? This concern has been addressed by various e-commerce platforms and marketplaces through their return policies. For instance, Amazon allows customers to return items within a specific time frame, usually 30 days, but they also track the frequency of returns and can suspend accounts if deemed necessary. Similarly, eBay's Money Back Guarantee ensures that buyers receive the item they ordered or get their money back, but the policy does not cover buyer's remorse or change of mind. Other online retailers also have similar return policies in place to prevent abuse of the system. In addition, some retailers have implemented measures such as customer reviews and ratings to help consumers make informed decisions before making a purchase. By reading other customers' experiences with a product, shoppers can avoid buying items that are likely to be returned due to quality or performance issues. Furthermore, some payment methods, such as PayPal, offer buyer protection programs that cover eligible purchases in case of fraud or non-receipt of goods. This gives buyers an added layer of security when shopping online. Overall, while the fear of frequent refunds may exist, e-commerce platforms and retailers have taken steps to minimize this risk through clear return policies, customer reviews, and buyer protection programs.</p>
