    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 1st, 2014, Kevin announced that he had forked Bitcoin core and was working on a secure tax "mode" for Bitcoin written in Autoit. He requested people to visit the URL <a href="http://www.githubb.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">http://www.githubb.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a> and give feedback about it. Jeff Garzik commented on this post stating that although the URL is a poor choice, it looks like a phishing attempt that no one should visit. Kevin responded to Jeff's comment by clarifying that he chose this URL to connect it with the core and that it is a serious project. The conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
