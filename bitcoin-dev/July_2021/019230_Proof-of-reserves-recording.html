    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of Proof of Reserves has been proposed, which would allow users to create private keys and generate a public key from this seed to represent their account. The custodian would update a map of addresses to balances, and this data would be combined with an HD wallet and hashed. The hash would be published in an on-chain transaction daily, allowing software for each user to continuously validate their balance. A receipt system could also be added, whereby users request a receipt for any balance updates. However, some argue that these schemes are only relevant to literal vaults or "warehouses" of Bitcoin and that there is no way to prevent a smash-and-grab. Furthermore, the proposal relies on the assumption that all assets and liabilities are provable, which is prohibitive.</p>
