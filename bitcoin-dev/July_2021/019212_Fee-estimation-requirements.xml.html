    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>At Github, a Bitcoin user named Dave has raised a query regarding the peculiarity of estimating fees. According to him, the software requires waiting for a couple of blocks after being synced before fee estimation will work. Although it is a true rule, it doesn't seem necessary and the software would be more useful if it didn't require this wait time. Dave estimates fees frequently but relies on block explorers to report the fees for the most recent blocks. Once the software is synced, it doesn't need to trust anything. He suggests that if this is a matter of priorities, it should be mentioned.</p>
