    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Billy and James discusses the use cases of a covenant opcode, specifically OP_CD. While James questions the benefits of this type of opcode compared to a 2-of-2 multisig wallet, Billy explains that it allows for the creation of highly secure wallet vaults with better redundancy than traditional multisig wallets. With a wallet vault using OP_CD, the user only needs one key to spend funds, but an attacker must steal two or more keys to access the funds. This provides the same level of security as a 2-of-2 multisig wallet, but with added benefits such as the ability for the user to recover their funds even if one key is lost and the second key can stay in a more secure location. The covenant opcode can also be used to limit the sender of an output or to limit a user's ability to send from one address they own to another. Overall, the proposal for OP_CD outlines several potential use cases and benefits for creating more accessible yet highly secure wallets for self-custody of keys.</p>
