    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>After receiving high level feedback, it has been suggested to spec out the opcodes as separate pieces of functionality. This is due to the fact that OP_CD seems to include 3 or 4 opcodes in one, such as amounts to outputs, output addresses, and something with fees. However, there is a major drawback to this approach. All transactions are twice as large as they would need to be for simple things like congestion control trees. This is because all of the output data must be repeated twice.</p>
