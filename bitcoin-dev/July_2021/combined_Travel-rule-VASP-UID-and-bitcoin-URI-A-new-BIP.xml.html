        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Karel Kyovsky proposed standardizing the bitcoin URI parameter name to contain the unique ID of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) that host a user's wallet address. The purpose is to integrate the travel rule for Bitcoin ATMs, where the operator must find out who the VASP is and send customer identity data. Currently, the ATM operator can search for the VASP using several ways, but they are not ideal. Therefore, the author suggests that users enable VASP UID in their mobile wallet settings, so that the Bitcoin ATM operator can communicate with them immediately after scanning the QR code. All wallet providers need to use the same parameter name in URI, which is the purpose of the proposed new BIP. The VASP UID could also be used as a public key to encrypt the customer's identity information before sending it to the wallet provider VASP from the Bitcoin ATM.The directory of VASP UIDs, how VASPs can be contacted, and the method of transfer should all be outside the scope of this BIP. The author expects this to be covered by third-party tools/platforms/regulators. Bitcoin ATM operators need to stay compliant with US regulation to stay in business, and the same applies to US custodian wallet service providers. Therefore, the majority of custodian wallets offered on Appstore/Google Play in the US would provide their VASP UID in bitcoin URI as a new default with an option for users to turn it off. It is important to note that the Travel Rule does not apply for unhosted (non-custodian) wallets.In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Karel Kyovsky proposed standardizing a new bitcoin URI parameter name. He asked whether he should create a new BIP or modify BIP21. In response, Dave suggested creating a new BIP and pointed to BIP72 as a previous instance where another URI parameter for BIP21 was standardized. Dave did not comment on Karel's compliance situation, which he mentioned in his original message.</p>
