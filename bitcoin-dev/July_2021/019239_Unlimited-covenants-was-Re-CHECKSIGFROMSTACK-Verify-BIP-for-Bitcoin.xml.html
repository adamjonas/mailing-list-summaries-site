    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post discusses the issue of permitting recursion at the transaction level and the arguments against it from a safety perspective. The author raises concerns about the ability to "go wrong" in surprising ways with recursive covenants and provides an example of a non-recursive covenant that demonstrates the issue. The example program is subtly "wrong" because the state transition of add_member does not verify that the pool's future withdraw call will be valid, and this could lead to a premature termination of the program. The author suggests that as we explore enabling covenants, we should add primitives in a methodical way and give users/toolchain builders primitives that enable and encourage safety and good program design. The CTV/Sapio model with its AOT compilation of automated state transitions and ability to statically analyze is a concept that can mature and be used in production in the near term, but the tooling to safely do recursive computations at the txn level will take quite a bit longer to mature.</p>
