    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, a member of the Bitcoin community named Jeremy expresses concern over the broader community's reluctance to embrace arbitrary covenants as they believe it could lead to more than what was bargained for. However, another member of the community named Dave argues that respecting the concerns of others can also be achieved by showing that their concerns are unfounded or less severe than they thought, rather than lobotomizing useful tools. Dave points out that some of the concerns raised in a recent post by Shinobi are already present in altcoins and recursive covenants may not necessarily make those problems worse. He believes that limiting Bitcoin's flexibility to avoid those problems is unnecessary when unlimited covenants could potentially offer interesting and useful features.</p>
