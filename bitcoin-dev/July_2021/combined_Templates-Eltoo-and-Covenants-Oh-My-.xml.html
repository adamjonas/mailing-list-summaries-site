        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed potential upgrades to Bitcoin, which he discussed in his recent blog post. The post covers four proposals, namely SH_APO (BIP-118), OP_CAT, OP_CSFS, and OP_CTV (BIP-119). Each upgrade is discussed in detail, including its use cases and design questions. Rubin provides a comparative analysis of the upgrades across several dimensions such as design specificity, hoping to foster discussion around potential new features, risk minimization, and pragmatic design for Bitcoin.While this is not an official roadmap or prioritization, the article discusses the safety and potential benefits of the proposed upgrades. Rubin ranks the upgrades in terms of safety, with CTV being the safest and CAT being the least safe due to its potential for unintended functionality. He suggests pairings of upgrades that can work together to deliver more advanced smart contract functionality, such as arbitrary covenants.Rubin recommends implementing the upgrades in the following order: CTV, CSFS, APO, and CAT. This approach represents a gradual relaxation of Bitcoin's restrictions around smart contract programming that introduces useful, safe primitives and gives the community time to build and deploy useful infrastructure. Overall, Rubin hopes to encourage discussion around potential new features, risk minimization, and pragmatic design for Bitcoin.</p>
