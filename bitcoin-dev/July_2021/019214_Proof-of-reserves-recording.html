    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has proposed an idea for proof of reserves that would allow ongoing verification of sufficient reserves. This involves users creating private keys using a seed to generate a public key, which they give to the custodian to represent their account in a public record of account balances. The custodian would update a map of addresses to balances and store funds on one or more HD wallets, creating a proof of ownership using the xpub for the wallet. These structures would be combined and hashed, with the hash published in an on-chain transaction daily. Users could continuously validate their account balance and verify owned addresses have sufficient funds. Receipts could also be requested for any balance update. Recording this on-chain prevents custodians from changing history and enables cross-verification among custodians. Losing keys is not a big deal as users can create a new seed and give a new public key to the custodian. Having a daily record reduces the possibility of short-term loans of large cryptocurrency amounts.</p>
