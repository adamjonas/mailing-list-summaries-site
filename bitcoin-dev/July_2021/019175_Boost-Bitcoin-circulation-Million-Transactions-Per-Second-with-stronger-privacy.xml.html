    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Sabu protocol is a cryptocurrency solution that offers several improvements over Lightning, including lower transaction fees and increased privacy. Transactions can be made without the need to open channels or pay Bitcoin transaction fees, which reduces costs and provides greater privacy. The Sabu protocol aims to motivate people to circulate transactions, ensuring that no one knows how much money is transferred from whom to whom. In case of fraudulent activity by the issuer, a Guarantee Transaction recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain can resolve the issue. The Sabu protocol also allows users to use any communication tool they prefer, making it transport-agnostic.Sabu's security model involves the issuer being the owner of UTXO(s) used in transactions and creating and signing valid transactions. This model presents a risk of the issuer cheating, but the Guarantee Transaction resolves this problem. Miners will choose transactions with the highest feeRate, making it unbeneficial for issuers to cheat creditors. Sabu's usability involves mobile/desktop wallets with encrypted communications between wallets and 12 seed words used for both Bitcoin wallet private key and PGP private key. Users can buy Satoshi without KYC and spend it, and the Bar can aggregate small transactions to one single transaction and send it to the Bitcoin network. Sabu offers a pure peer-to-peer network architecture without centralization or routing, and end-users are not exposed to its complexity. Although email has some privacy issues, Sabu uses email as a user identifier and communication tool to reform part of internet architecture and make it more decentralized. Users can choose between an unstoppable, permissionless, self-sovereignty, and decentralized pure peer-to-peer communication network (with resolvable privacy issues) or some efficient central limited network. Sabu's infrastructure is accessible globally, making it a better option than proprietary or closed protocols.The bitcoin-dev mailing list, hosted by the Linux Foundation, serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It is an open forum where anyone can participate in discussions and share their insights or questions regarding Bitcoin development.
