        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A chart has been created to assist in the ongoing review of BIP-118, which may be helpful for understanding the conditional logic involved in evaluating it. The chart shows that input index is never signed and APO signs the amounts but APOAS never does. Additionally, there are 16 different possible modes in total, including | Default and | All which overlap, leaving an opportunity to reserve or assign four additional sighash modes if desired.APO signs both the SPK and Tapleaf hash, and the signature binds APO to a specific script fragment within a Taproot key. Furthermore, because BIP-118 defines a new key type, the notion that sighash flags are "flags" could be converted to an enum, giving each signature type a sensible name.Although the chart is not free of errors, it provides valuable insight into the evaluation process of BIP-118. By understanding the conditional logic involved, individuals can make informed decisions about the implementation of BIP-118.</p>
