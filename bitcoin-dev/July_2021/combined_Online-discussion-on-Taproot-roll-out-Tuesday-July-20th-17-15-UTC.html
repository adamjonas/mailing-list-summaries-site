        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On July 20th, there was an online Zoom call held to discuss the Taproot roll out post activation in November. The focus of the discussion was on developers and the event was livestreamed on YouTube, allowing anyone to attend or watch. Murch, a participant in the call, has created a wiki page that tracks planned ecosystem support of P2TR addresses. The organizers of the event encouraged projects and businesses with Taproot support on their development roadmaps to contribute to the discussion. The meetup link, where the Zoom link was announced, was shared for participants to access. Prior to the call, draft pre-reading links were provided, which were expected to be finalized before Tuesday. These links can be found on <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/0803271754f851530fe8242087859254.In">https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/0803271754f851530fe8242087859254.In</a> summary, the online discussion on Taproot roll out took place on July 20th.
