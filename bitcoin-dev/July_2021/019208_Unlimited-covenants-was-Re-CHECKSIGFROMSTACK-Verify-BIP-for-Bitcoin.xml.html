    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Russell O'Connor raised concerns about recursive covenants and the implications of enabling OP_CAT. He suggested that such worries should be left for the OP_TWEAK operation as he had not seen any evidence that recursive covenants could be simulated with CHECKSIG(FROMSTACK). However, upon further thought, he acknowledged that recursive covenants could still be created by sneaking state into a few bits of the UTXO's amount or stashing it into a sibling output accessed via the txid embedded in the prevoutpoint. This highlights the importance of avoiding giving too much power, as people can be very clever and find unexpected ways to exploit limitations. Nonetheless, it was noted that altcoins already exist, some of which are substantially worse, and altcoin implementations would run on Turing machines anyway, making full EVM support possible.</p>
