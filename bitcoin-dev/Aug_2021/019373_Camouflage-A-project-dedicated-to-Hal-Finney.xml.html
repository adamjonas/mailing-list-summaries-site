    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Aymeric and Prayank revolves around the discussion on using the Tor protocol between Bitcoin nodes via node-Tor. The nodes can be browsers or wallets as well, but the use of Tor browser is neither foreseen nor encouraged. Prayank observes that the project uses JavaScript and WebRTC, which users who care about privacy generally disable while using a browser. Aymeric suggests adding to the links the discussion/issue regarding improving privacy in Bitcoin projects. Prayank also introduces his project to initiate discussions about improving privacy in different Bitcoin projects through issues and PRs related to privacy, a blog section for opinion on privacy-related issues and PRs, and a 'Hall of Fame' section to appreciate the contribution of developers working towards improving privacy. The project aims to never turn into a paid newsletter or require any sponsors, but contributions to make the website better are appreciated. The links provided in Aymeric's signature include several projects such as move your coins by yourself, Bitcoin transactions made simple, torrent-live, node-Tor, Zcash wallets made simple, Bitcoin wallets made simple, and peersm.</p>
