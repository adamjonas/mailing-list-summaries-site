    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty, CTO of Atkama, expressed his stance on planning for quantum computing. He suggested that planning should be limited to "a provable and written ability to upgrade if it becomes clear that it's necessary."  The conversation then turned to the subject of Taproot, which lost an important safety protection against quantum. According to Mark Friedenbach, there is no gain from Taproot as the features proposed can be implemented with hashed keys as well, albeit using more CPU time and bandwidth. Despite this issue, Luke Dashjr does not believe it's a reason to NACK Taproot. However, Dashjr believes it's essential that the wider community is aware of the tradeoff so they can make their own judgments.</p>
