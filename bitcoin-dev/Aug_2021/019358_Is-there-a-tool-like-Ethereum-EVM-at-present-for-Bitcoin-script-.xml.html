    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin does not have a virtual machine, but higher level languages such as Miniscript, Min.sc, Simplicity, and Sapio can compile to Bitcoin Script. However, Simplicity does not compile to Bitcoin Script, and Sapio assumes extensions that are not currently part of the consensus code. Although programming with Bitcoin script is based on reverse Polish expression, it has rich opcode expression ability which may be unfriendly for programmers and affect the promotion of Bitcoin in the technical community. A tool similar to Ethereum EVM does not exist at present, but users can write bitcoin scripts in a syntax similar to Python or other programming languages and translate them into original bitcoin scripts. Gijs van Dam suggests Sapio as it is written in Rust and might fit better in a user's setting. The Ivy lang Playground by Dan Robinson compiles contracts to Bitcoin Script but is not actively maintained.</p>
