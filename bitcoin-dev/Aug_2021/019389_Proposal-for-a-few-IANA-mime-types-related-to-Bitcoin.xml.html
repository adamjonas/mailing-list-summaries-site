    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Peter D. Gray stated that QR codes do not use IANA mime-types and discouraged the use of UR encoding for PSBT data in a web context, NFC, or email. While he understands the need for UR encoding in animated QR codes, he believes introducing new word lists (ByteWords), unique checksum algorithms (Xoshiro256), fountain codes (Luby Transform), and CBOR to wrap a few kilobytes of binary is unnecessary. However, he loves CBOR and thinks it's the best.UR is URL conformant text optimized for compression in QRs. The UR format is explained at the 20m0s mark in this video. The rest of the video explains why the choices were made when creating the UR specification. The goal was to leverage existing standards, but there were too many compromises, especially given QR requirements. The "Why Another Standard" section of the overview provides more information.The UR specification is not only being adopted by wallet vendors but also a number of online services and transaction coordinators that only have access watch-only keys. These services can then make a crypto-request for the airgapped wallet to sign the PSBT.</p>
