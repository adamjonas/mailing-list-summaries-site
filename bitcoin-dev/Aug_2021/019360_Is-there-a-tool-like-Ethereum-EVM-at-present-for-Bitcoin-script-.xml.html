    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sapio assumes extensions to Bitcoin Script that are not currently part of the consensus code, and Simplicity does not compile to Bitcoin Script. However, there are higher-level languages like Miniscript, Min.sc, Sapio, and Simplicity that can compile to Bitcoin Script. Sapio is written in Rust, which could be a good fit for some users. Additionally, users can stub out missing extensions with a signing federation instead, configurable as flags. It is also possible to write contracts that do not use ctv based components at all. The protocol for emulation is designed to ensure that contract compilation is completely offline and the oracles are stateless. Relevant links to learn more about the CTV emulator and finish options are provided. There is a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about whether there is a tool like Ethereum EVM for Bitcoin Script programming. While Bitcoin Script programming is based on reverse Polish expression and may be unfriendly for some programmers, it is noted that Bitcoin's opcode expression ability is very rich. The promotion of Bitcoin in the technical community may have been affected by this unfriendliness.</p>
