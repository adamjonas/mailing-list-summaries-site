        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 29th, 2021, a user named Prayank posted on the bitcoin-dev forum, suggesting that more numbers should be allowed in transaction version. The author shared an example of how transaction version could be used to bet on something with two outcomes without any involvement of centralized server or trusting third parties. The approach involved creating a multisig address using two public keys, one entered by the user and the other from mempool, followed by a funding transaction that uses version bits to indicate if Alice wants to bet on India or Australia. However, another user named Pieter expressed confusion regarding the suggestion and its relevance to transaction version numbers. Pieter's opinion was that Bitcoin transactions should only contain necessary information for validation. Currently, there are no consensus rules or relay policies that care about the version number except it being 1 or 2 (due to BIP68).Pieter further argued that using anything besides these two numbers would be pointless and a loss of privacy. Furthermore, currently-unused version numbers may be used for future consensus rules, so using them for non-protocol-defined purposes could interfere with these rules. In summary, Pieter does not believe that version numbers with no protocol-defined meaning should be standard and should instead be reserved for future extensions.The author also provided a link to Github with the full example of their proposed approach. It is clear that there are varying opinions on whether more numbers should be allowed in transaction version, with Pieter arguing for caution in extending the standard beyond what is currently needed for validation.</p>
