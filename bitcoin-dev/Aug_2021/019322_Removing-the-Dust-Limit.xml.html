    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user Jeremy proposed removing the dust limit from Bitcoin. While some argued that this would introduce spam and fingerprinting attack risks, Jeremy provided several reasons for removing the limit. These include allowing users to create any output they want, enabling dust-sized outputs to be used in various smart contracts and protocols, simplifying regulatory classification of lightning channels, using sats as value markers for colored coin protocols, and potential issues with confidential transactions. However, others like Antoine Riard were more conservative about increasing the standard dust limit, citing concerns about lowering funds safety and introducing trust vectors. Instead, they suggested smarter engineering solutions like utreexo or compressed colored coins/authentication smart contracts to solve scalability issues. While there was no consensus, some suggested possibly lowering the dust limit to 200 sats.</p>
