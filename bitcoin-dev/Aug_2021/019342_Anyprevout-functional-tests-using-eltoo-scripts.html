    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Richard has implemented basic functional test scripts for the eltoo channel update scheme to understand BIP-118/Anyprevout (APO). These tests are based on AJ Towns' rough Taproot eltoo scripts and his APO branch of core. Richard's functional tests are available in "test_tapscript_eltoo" function and can be accessed through Github. In addition, he has written a blog post that provides detailed information on how to run the tests and includes notes that may help anyone interested in APO and eltoo. Richard is open to working with others interested in eltoo and APO to extend and elaborate these tests, and any pull requests would be welcome. He expresses gratitude towards AJ and Christian Decker for their time and support in helping him understand the nuances of APO and eltoo.</p>
