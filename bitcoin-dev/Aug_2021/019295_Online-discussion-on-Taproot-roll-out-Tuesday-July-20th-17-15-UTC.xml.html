    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 20th, an online Zoom call about Taproot roll out post activation in November was held. The discussion was focused on developers and was livestreamed on YouTube. The call was open to everyone who wanted to attend or watch. Murch has a wiki page monitoring planned ecosystem support of P2TR addresses. It would be great to hear from projects and businesses that have Taproot support on their medium/long term development roadmap or are considering it. The link for the meetup was shared where the Zoom link was announced. Before the call, draft pre-reading links were shared, which were expected to be finalized before Tuesday. The reading list can be found on <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/0803271754f851530fe8242087859254.The">https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/0803271754f851530fe8242087859254.The</a> video and transcript from the online discussion on Taproot roll out that was held on July 20th are available.
