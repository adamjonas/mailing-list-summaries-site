    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Prayank shared his observation regarding the use of JavaScript and WebRTC in 'bitcoin-transactions' and 'node-Tor', which he found interesting but noted that users who prioritize privacy often disable both while using a browser. Aymeric suggested adding a discussion/issue on improving privacy in Bitcoin to Prayank's links. Prayank also shared a link to his project called 'Camouflage,' aiming to improve privacy in different Bitcoin projects through issues and pull requests, blog section, and a 'Hall of Fame' section to appreciate developers who contribute to privacy improvements. The project will not turn into a paid newsletter or require any sponsors, and Prayank welcomes contributions to make it better. He provided a link to the current website and mentioned moving everything to a new repository soon.</p>
