    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email from ZmnSCPxj discusses the implementation of a proposal and its potential costs and benefits. One issue is the need for explicit visibility to implement "change outputs must also be rate-limited." This can be done through allocating new SegWit versions or using anyone-can-spend `scriptPubKey` templates, but both options have drawbacks such as privacy concerns. Additionally, storing data with each output is necessary for this proposal, but this larger data is undesirable. Ideally, each output should just be a commitment rather than containing any actual data. However, this proposal requires explicit tagging to ensure "change outputs must be rate-limited too," which adds to the amount of data needed. The residual limit also needs to be kept with the output, and dropping the "change outputs must also be rate-limited" requirement would eliminate some of the gaps in the proposal but would reduce privacy. Overall, the email presents various challenges and considerations for implementing this proposal.</p>
