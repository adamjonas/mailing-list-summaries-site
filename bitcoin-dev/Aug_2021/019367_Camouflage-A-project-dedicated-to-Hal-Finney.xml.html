    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email wishes to improve privacy in Bitcoin and expresses their admiration for Hal Finney, who they believe could have helped with this effort. They provide a link to one of Finney's posts on the subject and mention having emailed about privacy-related issues on July 23. The author admits their email may not have been focused due to the fact that it was their birthday and they had consumed alcohol. Despite only receiving one response from someone who liked a video mentioned in the email, the author has created a project called Bitcoin Camouflage, which is intended to help improve privacy in different Bitcoin projects. This project includes a section for issues and PRs related to privacy from various Bitcoin projects, a blog section for the author's opinions on privacy-related issues and PRs, as well as a "Hall of Fame" section for appreciating the contributions of developers who are improving privacy in different Bitcoin projects. The author states that the project will never turn into a paid newsletter or require any sponsors, but they would appreciate any contributions to make the website better. Finally, the author invites Edward Snowden to contribute if he wants to do more than just tweet about improving Bitcoin privacy. The author provides two links: one to the current location of the project and another to where it will be moved to this weekend.</p>
