    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 29th, 2021, a user named Prayank posted on the bitcoin-dev forum, asking whether more numbers should be allowed in transaction version. They provided an example of how transaction version could be used to bet on something with two outcomes. However, another user named Pieter expressed confusion regarding the suggestion and its relevance to transaction version numbers. Pieter's opinion was that Bitcoin transactions should only contain necessary information for validation. Currently, there are no consensus rules or relay policies that care about the version number except it being 1 or 2 (due to BIP68). Therefore, using anything besides these two numbers would be pointless and a loss of privacy. Furthermore, currently-unused version numbers may be used for future consensus rules, so using them for non-protocol-defined purposes could interfere with these rules. In summary, Pieter does not believe that version numbers with no protocol-defined meaning should be standard and should instead be reserved for future extensions.</p>
