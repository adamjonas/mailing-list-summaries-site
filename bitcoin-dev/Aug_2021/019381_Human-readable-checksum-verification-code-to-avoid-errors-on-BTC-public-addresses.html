    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user "ts" proposed adding a verification code to bitcoin addresses to make them more user-friendly. However, Pieter Wuille questioned the need for such a code, noting that base58check and bech32/bech32m already protect against random typos through checksums. Ts clarified that the code was meant to prevent copy-and-paste errors, which can be caused by technical or user error. While Wuille acknowledged that comparing a few characters of the address could provide similar protection, Ts argued that a quick check of a 3 or 4 digit code in bigger font next to the address would improve user experience and prevent users from forgetting to check the characters altogether. The proposal also sparked discussion about the potential adoption challenges and the possibility of using visual checksums instead. Another user, Slush, agreed with Wuille that the proposal did not solve any particular problem and could even make things worse.</p>
