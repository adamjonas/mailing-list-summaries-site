    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Andrew Poelstra of Sapio revealed that the company needs the rust Bitcoin taproot ecosystem to mature before it can take advantage of Taproot with Sapio. He also stated that they need a spec for miniscript taproot, but they could "monkey patch" one in without it.  Michael Folkson asked about Sapio's plans to take advantage of Taproot and suggested updating the "No Taproot" section of the Sapio docs. Poelstra replied that Sapio assumes extensions, but if they are not present, they can be stubbed out with a signing federation. He also mentioned the protocol for emulation, which he considers clever. In addition, Poelstra mentioned having technical difficulties with getting Libera to work and expressed interest in retrying to get it to work. Meanwhile, there have been questions about Sapio and CTV on the Libera equivalents of Freenode channels #sapio and ##ctv-bip-review over the past months. It is unclear whether Sapio plans to join and claim those channels. Relevant links were provided to resources on the Sapio website.</p>
