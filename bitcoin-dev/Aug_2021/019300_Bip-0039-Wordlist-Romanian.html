    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin development team has created a new Romanian wordlist for Bip-0039 and requested permission to push it to GitHub. Another member responded, suggesting that the words be uniquely identified using the first four letters as most backup "plates" only have space for four letters. This would make it easier for restoring from seed on mobile wallets. However, there were several occurrences of conflicting words on the list, and the unique identification proposal was not considered a hard requirement. The second member also noted that the word list was not acceptable in its current form and should be revised by someone with knowledge in Romanian lexical area. They pointed out some errors, such as the misspelling of _adesiv_ instead of *adeziv*, and the inclusion of non-Romanian words like _walkman_ and _web_. Additionally, some words such as _yachting_ were not Romanian and could be replaced with a more appropriate term like *navigatie*. The member concluded that the word list needs changes and requested that the necessary corrections be made.</p>
