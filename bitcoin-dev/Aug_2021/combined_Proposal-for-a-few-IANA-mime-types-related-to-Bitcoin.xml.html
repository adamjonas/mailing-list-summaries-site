        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email to Peter D. Gray, Andrew Chow expressed uncertainty about the possibility of registering mime types for Bitcoin things in the desired way. He explained that he had attempted to register "application/bitcoin-psbt" back in 2019 but it was not accepted due to limitations with accepted top-level types and tree requirements. To be in the standards tree, registration must be either associated with an IETF specification or registered by a recognized standards related organization. Unfortunately, the closest thing to a standards organization that Bitcoin has is the BIPs process, which is neither a standards organization nor recognized by IANA. As a result, they would need to write an RFC to register the mime types as Standards tree types, but this could be an independent submission rather than an IETF-stream submission. Chow also provided an alternative option to use the Vendor tree, which would prefix the mimetype with "vnd." so it would end up being something like "application/vnd.bitcoin.psbt". However, he did not think this was reasonable and did not pursue it further. In another email, Peter D. Gray proposed to register three MIME media types with the IANA: bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri. He explained that these types are useful for web servers and also elsewhere, and he intends to use them in NFC (NDEF records) where a shorter length is critical. He added that some mime-types are proposed in BIP-71 but those are unrelated to the above and have never been registered. Gray also noted that for those who like to encode their binary as base64 or hex, that can be indicated as "encoding=hex" or "encoding=base64" in the optional parameters, just like "text/plain; encoding=utf-8" does. However, the default must be binary.</p>
