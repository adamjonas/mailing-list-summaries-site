        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Prayank, who is not skilled in UI/UX, expressed gratitude to Alekos for launching bip174.org, a PSBT viewer and editor that runs in the browser. Prayank suggested adding a light and dark theme switch option and color highlighting for certain elements. He also proposed a similar project for experimenting with descriptors. In response, Alekos mentioned the availability of a web-based tool on BDK's website for building descriptors graphically based on Scratch.Alekos Filini, a member of the Bitcoin development community, announced the launch of bip174.org, a PSBT viewer and editor that operates in the browser. The Airgapped Wallet Community has requested the addition of UR-based animated QRs as an output option on the website. This is because advanced hardware and software wallets now support Airgapped UR/QR PSBT signing. There are multiple libraries available in various languages to support these UR QRs, making it easy to output them from the site. Furthermore, major web-based transaction coordinator services plan to incorporate browser scanning of PSBTs using laptop cameras. Christopher Allen shared a video example demonstrating this capability between the Foundation Devices hardware wallet and Blue Wallet.bip174.org allows users to paste a PSBT to view its content. Any changes made to the fields within the PSBT are automatically updated on the site. The website includes pre-built examples for quick testing. Daniela Brozzoni and Alekos developed this tool to simplify the dumping and modification of PSBTs they encounter in their daily work. Inspired by bip32.org, the web app is entirely built in Rust compiled to WASM. Contributions, feedback, and bug reports are encouraged, and the source code can be found on GitHub.</p>
