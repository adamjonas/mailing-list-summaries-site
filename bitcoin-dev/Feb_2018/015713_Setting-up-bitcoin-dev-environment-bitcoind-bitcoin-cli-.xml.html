    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is seeking help to set up a bitcoin development environment on their Mac. They have installed the Bitcoin Core client and downloaded the binaries but are facing several issues. Firstly, they are unable to open the configuration file from bitcoin-qt even though it exists at $HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf. When attempting to open it via bitcoin-qt (Preferences -> Show configuration file), a popup appears with an error message saying "Configuration file could not be opened". The writer has also attempted to change the permissions, but this did not work. Secondly, they can launch bitcoind in -regtest regime, but when they try to launch *bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101*, they receive an error with the message "error code: -32601" and "error message: Method not found". Lastly, when they try to use *bitcoin-cli getinfo*, they receive an error message stating "error: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (/Users/..../Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)". The writer hopes someone can assist them in resolving these issues so they can successfully set up their bitcoin development environment.</p>
