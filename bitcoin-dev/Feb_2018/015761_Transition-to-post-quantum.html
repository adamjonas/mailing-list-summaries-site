    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Tim Ruffing proposed a scheme for securing transactions by using hash commitments. The scheme would require users to commit to a transaction with a hash before revealing the full transaction details, preventing attackers from modifying the transaction in advance. However, some members of the mailing list raised concerns about the security and practicality of the proposal. One issue raised was that allowing transactions to expire could make them vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. Another concern was that the proposed scheme could lead to miners being flooded with invalid transaction commitments. Some participants suggested using a simple hash commitment that could be "folded away" in a Merkle tree hash until the full transaction is published. Ultimately, no consensus was reached on the proposal.</p>
