    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Damian Williamson and an anonymous individual have disagreed on the method used by developers of Bitcoin Cash to improve the cryptocurrency's capabilities. Williamson has suggested that the statement "Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize" is incorrect as it does not acknowledge that the developers also wanted to implement other improvements besides SegWit. The anonymous individual has countered Williamson's argument by pointing out that SegWit includes several features beyond scaling, such as transaction tree creation, smart contracts and micropayment networks. Furthermore, while Bitcoin Cash did increase the block size, it has yet to implement the improvements provided by SegWit. The anonymous individual believes that Williamson's wording implies that Bitcoin Cash has implemented SegWit, when in fact it has not.</p>
