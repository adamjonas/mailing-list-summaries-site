        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 9th, 2018, Maksim Solovjov encountered problems when trying to launch bitcoind in the -regtest regime. Specifically, when attempting to run the command "bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101", an error with the code -32601 and the message "Method not found" was displayed. Further investigation revealed that the setgenerate command had been removed in version 0.13.0, as explained in the release notes (doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md). Additionally, when the writer tried to execute the command "bitcoin-cli getinfo", another error occurred. This time, the error message stated that no authentication cookie could be found and that no rpcpassword was set in the configuration file located at "/Users/..../Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf". The user was advised to check their installed version of Bitcoin and understand that, even before deprecation, a bitcoin.conf file needs to be correctly located for bitcoin-cli to locate it.The writer is seeking assistance in setting up a bitcoin development environment on their Mac. They have installed the Bitcoin Core client and downloaded the binaries, but are encountering several issues. Firstly, they are unable to open the bitcoin.conf configuration file from the bitcoin-qt application, despite its existence at the path "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf". When attempting to access it through bitcoin-qt's preferences and selecting "Show configuration file", an error message appears stating "Configuration file could not be opened". The writer has also attempted to change the permissions of the file, but this did not resolve the issue.In addition to the configuration file problem, the writer is experiencing errors when launching bitcoind in the -regtest regime. Although they can successfully launch it, when attempting to use the command "bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101", they receive an error message with the code -32601 and the message "Method not found". Furthermore, when they try to execute the command "bitcoin-cli getinfo", they receive an error stating that no authentication cookie could be found and no rpcpassword is set in the bitcoin.conf configuration file.Given these challenges, the writer is hoping that someone can provide guidance or assistance in resolving these issues. Their ultimate goal is to successfully set up their bitcoin development environment.</p>
