    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Feb 18, 2018, a question was asked on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in regards to the increased blockspace enabled by the segregated witness upgrade. The user named Cannon asked if the extra blockspace beyond the legacy 1 MB limit is limited to just witness data. The response given was "effectively yes" and that the discount on weight applies to the witness data. Cannon's PGP fingerprint and email were also provided. The email signature stated that all email correspondence not signed/encrypted with PGP should be considered potentially forged and not private. An HTML attachment was included but no further information about it was given.</p>
