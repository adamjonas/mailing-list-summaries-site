        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The latest version of Bitcoin Core, version 0.16.0, includes full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces, as well as a new argument `address_type` that can be added to generate a specific type of address. Full support for native segwit addresses (BIP173 / Bech32) has also been added. However, wallets created with version 0.16.0 will not be compatible with previous versions due to a backward-incompatible change in the wallet database.Other updates include default BIP125 RBF usage on the send screen, a new RPC `rescanblockchain` to manually invoke a blockchain rescan, and disabled safe mode by default. The SHA256 hashing optimizations have now been enabled by default, and there are notable changes in the wallets directory configuration (`-walletdir`).Bitcoin Core's network has also received several new features, including an "errors" field to `getblockchaininfo` and unified "errors" field in `get*info` RPCs. Other updates include a fix for `getchaintxstats()`, process improvement for shutdown, and measures to avoid slow transaction searches with `txindex` enabled. Improvements have also been made to the GUI, build system, testing, and QA.The Bitcoin Core team has been working on improving functional tests and documentation. They have fixed inconsistencies and grammar in various files, updated release notes and manpages for 0.16, and made various other fixes and updates to the documentation. There have also been updates to the codebase, such as the addition of the `const` keyword and replacement of the deprecated `throw()` with the `noexcept` specifier. Lastly, the list provided consists of the names of individuals who have contributed to the development of Bitcoin, including developers, translators, and other contributors from around the world.</p>
