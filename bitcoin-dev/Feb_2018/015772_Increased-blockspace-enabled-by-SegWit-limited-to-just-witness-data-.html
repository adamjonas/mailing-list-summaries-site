    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The block size limit of one megabyte has been replaced by a block weight limit of four million weight units. Although Eric Voskuil argues that no rule has been replaced, it is clear that the new rule is more restrictive than the previous one. The semantics on the difference between "replacing with a more restrictive rule" and "leaving the existing rules, but adding a new one" are unimportant, as there are not two separate limits or anything. As a soft fork, all preceding rules remain in effect, and blocks must validate against pre-SegWit rules or are invalid. Additional rules are applied that further restrict validity and consider additional (witness) data in the context of the block.</p>
