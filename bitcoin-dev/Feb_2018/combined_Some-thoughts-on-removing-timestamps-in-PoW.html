        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion arose regarding the modification of Bitcoin via a mailing list. Greg Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, shared his thoughts on modifying Bitcoin but clarified that his post was not meant to be interpreted as a proposal to modify Bitcoin. Ryan J Martin replied to the thread and suggested that such changes would be better attempted as a fork to a new coin. The author supports forking to a new coin instead of changing the max number of coins, block reward, difficulty algo, mining policy, and protocol.Greg Slepak proposes an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm for Bitcoin that would remove the need for timestamps in the blockchain. The new algorithm allows miners to mine blocks of any difficulty they choose, with a maximum deviation of 20% from the previous block. However, this system could introduce risks related to potential centralization pressures on miners and full nodes due to the increase in total transaction throughput. The proposal suggests introducing state checkpoints into the chain itself or implementing a sharded protocol that uses a sufficiently different PoW algorithm to address these concerns.The email conversation discusses modifying the protocol to address concerns related to state checkpoints and full node verification. Some propose designing a new blockchain where these issues are not a problem, while others raise concerns about new full nodes not having complete knowledge of utxo's if large sections of the blockchain are skipped during verification. Overall, the proposal suggests forking to a new coin rather than attempting to make these changes to the existing Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
