    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent flurry of Bitcoin hard forks is exacerbating the confusion about the very nature of the project and is harming it in many ways, according to a contributor to the Bitcoin community. The liberal MIT license, which Bitcoin is licensed under, is beneficial to many other projects, companies, and individuals. However, it is believed that several projects are unfairly taking advantage of this generous license to attack Bitcoin, confuse the public, and gain personal profit in a way that is severely harming the Bitcoin ecosystem. Therefore, there has been a suggestion to amend the MIT license by adding a line such as: "No part of this software can be included in any other project that uses the name Bitcoin as part of its name and/or its marketing material unless the software produced by that project is fully compatible with the Bitcoin (core) blockchain."</p>
