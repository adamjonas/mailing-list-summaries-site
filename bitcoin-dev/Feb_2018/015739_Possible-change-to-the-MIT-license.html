    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal to alter the license terms for Bitcoin to prevent it from being used by fork coins has been met with criticism. Some believe that such a move would damage the credibility of the protocol, which was born to be an independent, freedom-based, government-free, and boundaries-free approach to the current monetary system. Jameson Lopp argues that any defense against branding attacks on Bitcoin should be social/marketing based rather than relying on courts or governments. Others suggest that a trademark could better solve the problem, but it also adds legal uncertainty and may not affect those forking older versions of Bitcoin or using existing independent blockchain implementations and renaming them Bitcoin-Whatsoever. It is argued that being unable to mention Bitcoin is overkill and the software license does not affect the blockchain data.</p>
