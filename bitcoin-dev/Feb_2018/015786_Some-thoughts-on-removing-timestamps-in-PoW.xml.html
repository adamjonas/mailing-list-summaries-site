    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the possibility of modifying the protocol to address concerns related to state checkpoints and full node verification. The suggestion is to design a blockchain where these issues are not a problem, as opposed to being limited by Bitcoin's current design constraints. There have been proposals for this type of protocol across the web, with some blockchains already implementing it (such as Ethereum via parity). Damian Williamson raises concerns about the proposal, stating that new full nodes may not have complete knowledge of utxo's if large sections of the blockchain are skipped during verification.</p>
