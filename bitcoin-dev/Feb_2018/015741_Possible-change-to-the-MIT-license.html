    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There has been discussion among developers on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a proposal to alter Bitcoin Core's license terms in order to limit liability for developers subject to lawsuits. However, there are concerns as to who would have the right to assert an offensive claim that their license terms had been breached. Additionally, some believe that any defense against attacks on Bitcoin should be social/marketing-based rather than relying on courts or governments. There is frustration over ongoing FUD and scammery going unanswered in any "official" capacity. One suggested solution to disincentivize fork coins from using the word Bitcoin is altering the license terms, but this may not be effective as it requires an entity that intends to use court systems to threaten noncompliant projects into submission. Some argue that trademarks would be a better solution. There are also concerns that the proposed license change would create legal uncertainty and would not affect anyone forking older versions of Bitcoin or existing independent blockchain implementations. Additionally, being unable to even mention Bitcoin is seen as overkill.</p>
