        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Helder Garcia is researching the signalling and activation mechanism of updates in Bitcoin, and has studied several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) including BIP34, BIP9, and BIP8. While going through BIP8, he came across a concept where an update will be activated even if the threshold of 95% signalling is not reached in the STARTED state, as soon as blockchain height equals or exceeds the timeout_height. Helder sought to clarify his understanding and the risks associated with activating a change without the majority of hash power accepting it.ZmnSCPxj responded by explaining that assuming the update is widespread among economic actors, only miners who do not follow the more stringent rules of the update will suffer as their blocks will have a high probability of not following those rules and thus will be implicitly rejected by economic actors. Rational miners who follow the update, no matter how small their hash power share, would prefer the chain that economic actors will accept as real and would build only on blocks that follow updated rules strictly. The time from STARTED to ACTIVE simply serves to let miners upgrade their software, as a concession that in the real world we cannot safely deploy new software in a single day.</p>
