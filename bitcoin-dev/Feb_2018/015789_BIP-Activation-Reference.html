    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Damian Williamson has submitted a query on the possibility and desirability of adding a `nBlockHeight Activated` column to the README.mediawiki or including such information in the BIP Header format. The purpose of this addition would be to show a specific reference to when a BIP was activated. Williamson's query is related to bitcoin/BIPS, which is a repository for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The BIPs are design documents that describe new features, processes, or improvements for the Bitcoin protocol. The README.mediawiki is a file in the repository that serves as the main page for the project. It provides a brief description of each BIP along with its status. The proposed addition would provide additional information about the activation of BIPs. Currently, the README.mediawiki only includes the status of a BIP and its author(s). If the proposed column were added, it would show the block height at which a BIP was activated. This would make it easier for developers and users to track the implementation of BIPs and determine when they became available. Additionally, if such information were included in the BIP Header format, it would be easier to identify the activation block height by examining the BIP itself.Overall, the proposed addition of a `nBlockHeight Activated` column to the README.mediawiki or inclusion of such information in the BIP Header format would provide more specific information about the activation of BIPs. This could be beneficial for developers and users who want to track the implementation of BIPs and determine when they became available.</p>
