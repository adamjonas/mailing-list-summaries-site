    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Several members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list have expressed their disagreement with a proposed change to the Bitcoin Core software licensing terms. The proposed change would prohibit any other project that uses the name Bitcoin from including any part of the Bitcoin Core software, unless that software is fully compatible with the Bitcoin Core blockchain. Some members argue that this is not the right solution to the problem of fork coins using the Bitcoin name, and instead suggest that social and marketing-based approaches should be used. Others also point out that such a licensing change could cause legal uncertainty and harm the credibility of Bitcoin's philosophy of being free and independent. Furthermore, they argue that the use of the name Bitcoin cannot be avoided due to its nature as a protocol and that prohibiting it would be like prohibiting the use of the word "Linux" in brands based on the Linux kernel.</p>
