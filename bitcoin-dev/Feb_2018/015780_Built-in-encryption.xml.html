    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on the bitcoin-dev mailing list asked if it was possible to encrypt data in a way that only the receiver could read it without exchanging information off the network. A response suggested that theoretically, if the recipient address had already disclosed the public key or shared it with the sender alongside the address, then the sender could use the recipient's ECDSA key to encrypt the message with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), as both ECDSA and ECC share the same kind of public/private key pair. However, in practice, it is uncertain whether nodes would broadcast such a non-standard transaction. The email also mentioned the possibility of using a sidechain or RSK for encryption. The original post included ideas for potential uses of encrypted transactions.</p>
