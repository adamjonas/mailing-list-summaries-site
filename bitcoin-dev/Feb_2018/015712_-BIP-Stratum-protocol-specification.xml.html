    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jules Lamur, along with two student colleagues, is developing a mining pool as an academic work. Due to lack of documentation, they are currently reverse engineering existing implementations of the protocol, with the aim of publishing their own specification. Their referent professor suggested publishing an IETF RFC draft for the protocol's specification, but Jules feels that a BIP would be more appropriate. Upon further research, Jules found that BIP 40 and BIP 41 were allocated for the wire protocol and mining protocol respectively since August 2013. However, nothing has been done since. Jules is now considering writing a draft for BIP 41 (mining protocol) with his colleagues.</p>
