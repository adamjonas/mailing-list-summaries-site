    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent discussion among members of the Bitcoin community has centered on whether BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) that document buried deployments should be labeled as "soft fork" or "hard fork." While BIP 123 suggests that all consensus layer BIPs should be assigned one of these labels, some argue that buried deployments do not require community and miner coordination for a safe deployment and therefore should not be classified in this way. Luke Dashjr points out that buried deployments do not require software coordination either, leading him to question the necessity of having BIPs at all. However, others argue that these documents help people understand the Bitcoin system and aid developers in understanding what safety analyses have already been conducted. Inaccurate analyses could lead to serious consequences, so it is important to have clear documentation in place.</p>
