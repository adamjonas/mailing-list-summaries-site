    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Damian Williamson and CANNON, Williamson disagreed with the statement that Bitcoin Cash decided to increase the blocksize over implementing SegWit changes alone. He suggested that the wording be changed to "Rather than being satisfied with the implementation of SegWit changes alone, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to also increase the blocksize." However, CANNON pointed out that SegWit includes many improvements unrelated to scaling, and that Bitcoin Cash has yet to implement these improvements and capabilities. SegWit enables advanced transaction trees, enhanced smart contracts, trustless mixing protocols, micropayment networks, and increases the security of signatures. The email exchange also included a PGP signed message.</p>
