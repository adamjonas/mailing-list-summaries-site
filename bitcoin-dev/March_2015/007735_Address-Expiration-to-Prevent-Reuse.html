    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion back in July 2014, the idea of limited-lifetime addresses was explored for Bitcoin. This hypothetical address would have an expiration date embedded in it, allowing the sender to refuse to send funds after that time. However, if the sender is uncooperative, they can still change the destination address and proceed with the transaction. This method could potentially work as well as the non-reorg safe network version without impacting the network, but it would require additional space to communicate the limit. Another proposal mentioned in the email thread involves blocking transactions if a prior confirmed transaction has already paid the address. This method would require an unprunable verification state.</p>
