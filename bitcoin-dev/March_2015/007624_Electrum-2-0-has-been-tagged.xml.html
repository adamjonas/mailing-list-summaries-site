    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin has released the latest version 2.0 of Electrum, which has been on a very long hiatus due to the time it took to decide about the new seed derivation method and wallet structure. The release includes a large amount of changes and new features such as new seed derivation method, new address derivation, support for multisig wallets, hardware wallets, compact serialization format for unsigned or partially signed transactions, BIP70 payment requests, two-factor authentication service by TrustedCoin, Cosigner Pool plugin, Audio Modem plugin, OpenAlias plugin, and more. Electrum is now saved as JSON file format, but old wallet files can still be converted to the new format. Additionally, the client accepts servers with a CA-signed SSL certificate. The Android GUI has received various updates and works much more stable now. The Authenticator script was added to Android which reads an unsigned transaction shown as QR code, signs it and shows the result as a QR code.</p>
