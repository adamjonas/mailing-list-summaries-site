    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and another individual, the issue of duplicate checks in Bitcoin transactions was addressed. Harding proposed limiting the duplicate check to an X-block segment, with X being hard-coded as 144 (equivalent to "1-day addresses"). The idea of a selectable expiration duration was also suggested. The other individual questioned why this limitation couldn't be made a client feature instead of a consensus rule, as people could still bypass it if they wanted to. They gave an example of how someone could take someone else's pubkey, add G to it, strip off the time limits, and send funds to hide their payment under a rock. Harding responded by stating that payment can only be tendered when it is made exactly to the payee's specifications, and violating those specifications would only result in the destruction of coins. He suggested that a simpler and safer client-enforced behavior may be preferable, as anyone who wants to hack their client to make a payment not according to the payee's specifications will have to live with the consequences.</p>
