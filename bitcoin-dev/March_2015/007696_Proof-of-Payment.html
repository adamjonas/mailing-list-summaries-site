    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A person named Kalle Rosenbaum has come up with a new idea known as Proof of Payment (PoP) for proving that a payment has been made. There are various scenarios where PoP can be useful such as for pre-paid hotel rooms, online video rental services, ad-signs, and lotteries. The unique feature of PoP is that it can be generated on demand and is only usable once to avoid any issues due to theft. Additionally, it can create PoP for any payment regardless of script type. Anonymous Credentials is another concept discussed in the context, which allows an issuer to declare that a person has certain rights like using their service until a certain date. It provides privacy for usage of services while keeping a degree of accountability for the payment. Although issuance of Anonymous Credentials is not atomic with payment transactions, a proof of having paid for the credentials can be used in court if they are not issued.Furthermore, Zerocoin developers have also come up with a paper on a blockchain version of Distributed Anonymous Credentials. A link to the blog discussing this topic is provided for additional information.</p>
