    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is focused on a web wallet server and the privacy concerns related to it. The clients being SPV can check their own balances and download transaction history, which means the coordination tasks could be done by storing encrypted blobs on the server rather than the server itself having insight into what's going on. It is mentioned that private keys are not stored at the server and addresses can be generated offline. Copay uses the encrypted blob idea to check balances and transaction history thought Insight. However, it is believed that having some visibility of the wallet by the multisig facilitator will make the user experience much better. The engineering cost to prevent the server from knowing xpubs keys needs to be evaluated. A reference to Subspace was provided for further exploration.</p>
