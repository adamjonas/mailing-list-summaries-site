    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message is a first-time poster who seeks the opinions of others regarding a proposal called "transaction locking" which claims to make it possible to accept 0-conf transactions with a guarantee that they will be mined. The author expresses skepticism about this claim and questions why there has been no discussion of it on the mailing list. The scheme works by broadcasting an InstantX transaction that spends certain outputs in Darkcoin. Certain nodes sign a message that locks this transaction in the mempool, preventing its inputs from being double-spent. All nodes are told to reject conflicting transactions and flush out any existing ones in the mempool that conflict with the locked transaction. Once a transaction receives a consensus lock across nodes in the mempool, it is guaranteed to be mined as there is no way it can be double-spent, and miners cannot mine a double spend of the consensus-locked transaction. However, the author points out that there may be an attack vector that could cause blocks to be rejected and potentially fork the network, and provides a link to a paper that offers a full explanation of the proposal.</p>
