    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email correspondence, Gregory Maxwell suggests that for an emergency transition, it is better to use an explicit unstructured mass private key export and a sweep function. He also recommends guaranteeing compatibility with the function is much easier, and there is less chance of going from secure to insecure as it moves funds in one direction. However, he expresses concerns about the availability of sweep functions that create at least the same number of keys or possibly more for sweeping purposes. Bryan adds to this by suggesting that there are different levels of emergency where you may want to sweep all at once in a single transaction and lose out on already nebulous privacy benefits. Bryan believes that broadcasting a bunch of transactions all at the same time during the sweep can compromise privacy even when the transactions have no common ancestor outputs.</p>
