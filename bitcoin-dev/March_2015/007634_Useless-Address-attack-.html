    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoind protects against potential attackers by storing the addresses it has learned about in randomized buckets based on the IP of the peer that advertised the address message and the address in the message itself. The bucket selection is organized into 256 "new" buckets for untried addresses and 64 "tried" buckets for known accessible nodes. When adding a new address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry is removed from it first based on a bias favoring less recently seen or tried ones. Bitcoind also detects and blacklists misbehaving nodes for a period of time to prevent continual connection attempts to tarpit nodes. Someone on the Bitcoin-development mailing list suggested filling up the address pool with dummy nodes to slow down communication over the P2P network, but this would be prevented by Bitcoind's measures against malicious attacks.</p>
