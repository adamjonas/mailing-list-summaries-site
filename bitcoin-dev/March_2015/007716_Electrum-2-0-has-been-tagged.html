    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on the Bitcoin-development mailing list from March 12th 2015, Andreas Schildbach discussed issues with using BIP70 for mobile wallets. The problem was that they needed to consider the offline case, and in order to fix it, they would need to extend BIP70 to tell the merchant where to forward the half-signed transaction. However, this may not be desirable for privacy reasons. In response, another participant suggested un-multisigging some of the coins for daily use, up to a defined velocity limit. The discussion also touched on the topic of multisig adoption, which was predicted to increase exponentially, reaching the majority of coins by the end of the year.</p>
