        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Pindar Wong, the idea of adding a statement indicating that a BIP number will be assigned after copy-editing and acceptance, and that it will be published on the Bitcoin Wiki page, is discussed. Wong suggests introducing a 'Bitcoin-Draft' status with an auto-expiry period similar to the concept of 'Internet Drafts' used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Maxwell explains that posting to the list is already considered a draft document and requires no approval beyond filling out the appropriate form, but agrees that calling it a distinct step might be better.On March 11, 2015, Pindar Wong suggests the creation of a 'Bitcoin-Draft' (BD) status with an auto-expiry period, drawing a comparison to the success of the IETF's 'Internet Drafts' (ID). Another participant in the conversation notes that posting to the list serves a similar purpose and creating a draft document requires no approval beyond filling out the appropriate form. It is suggested to potentially establish a distinct step for creating a draft document.The suggestion to create a 'Bitcoin-Draft' (BD) status with an auto-expiry period similar to the IETF's concept of 'Internet Drafts' (ID) is met with caution due to past issues with people squatting on prior draft proposals and demanding access to the same numbers. It is emphasized that squatted numbers will not be assigned and discussion must come before number assignment. Proposals should not be referred to as "BIP[nn]" until they are actually a BIP, and placeholder names can be used during the drafting process.Thomas Kerin proposes a new standard for creating standard multisignature P2SH addresses given 'm' and a set of public keys. He creates a PR on bitcoin/bips and uses BIP0090 as a placeholder, requesting a BIP number for this purpose. The method is currently used by CryptoCorp for their external signer service. The email is sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list and also includes a promotion for the Go Parallel website, sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media, which provides resources related to parallel software development.In the email thread from March 11, 2015, Thomas Kerin requests a BIP number for his proposal. The issue of individuals squatting on BIP numbers and demanding access to them is discussed, leading to the suggestion that proposals should not be referred to as "BIP[nn]" until they are actually a BIP. Instead, placeholder names can be used during the drafting process. It is emphasized that discussion should come before number assignments, and that many proposals are withdrawn after further discussion shows that they are without public interest or subsumed by other functionality. If there is any confusion regarding the process, individuals are encouraged to bring it to attention.Bitcoinj, a Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, uses the convention of representing units of Bitcoin as "satoshi" in code, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. This convention is also used by other Bitcoin implementations, including Bitcoin Core.Thomas Kerin's proposal for creating standard multisignature P2SH addresses given 'm' and a set of public keys can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/146">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/146</a>. The email message also includes Thomas Kerin's PGP key.</p>
