        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread from 2015 between Adrian Macneil and Coinbase discusses the impact of the proposed Replace-by-Fee (RBF) protocol and its potential difficulty in making Bitcoin a viable alternative to credit card payments for large merchants. Several questions were asked, including whether Coinbase was contractually obliged to accept zeroconf transactions with existing customers, their double-spend losses to date, and their plans to move away from dependency on "first-seen" mempool policy. Mike Hearn wrote two blog posts on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding replace by fee and double-spending mitigations. The first post argues against RBF-SE and explains why it could be harmful to Bitcoin, while the second summarizes double spending incidents against merchants and discusses several techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of double spending. These techniques include risk analysis of transactions, payment channels, countersigning by a trusted third party, remote attestation, ID verification, waiting for confirmations, and punishment of double spending blocks. The material is considered useful and interesting to those interested in the topic. In addition, the post includes a link to the Go Parallel Website, which is a hub for all things parallel software development.</p>
