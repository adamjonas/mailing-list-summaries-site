    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this message is pondering the possibility of slowing down communication over the P2P network by creating dummy nodes that only exchange version and relay addresses. They suggest sending addr messages with all 1000 addresses pointing to their useless nodes, which may cause clients to connect to those nodes instead of legitimate ones. The writer wonders if filling up the address pool with enough addresses to dumb nodes and keeping them fresh could have a significant impact, particularly if all eight outbound connections are used up by their nodes. However, they clarify that they do not actually intend to carry out this plan and are simply considering it while building their own node. They question what measures exist to prevent such tactics from being employed.</p>
