    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 11, 2015, Thomas Kerin proposed a new standard for creating standard multisignature P2SH addresses given m and a set of public keys. He created a PR on bitcoin/bips and used BIP0090 as a placeholder but requested a BIP number for this purpose. This method is currently used by CryptoCorp for their external signer service. The email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The email also includes a promotion for the Go Parallel website, which is sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media. The website provides weekly thought leadership blogs, news, videos, case studies, tutorials, and more, all related to parallel software development. The email was signed off by devrandom / Miron.</p>
