    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The topic of address expiration has been discussed in the context of reducing the rate of increasing bitcoin addresses. However, it has been argued that enforcing this practice by default is not necessary. There are certain use cases where address re-use is justified, such as a donation address spread on multiple static pages or even printed on papers/books. In some situations, users may need to archive all keys, hashes of transactions and everything due to accounting requirements. Thus, enforcing expiration would undermine an user's rights to re-use their addresses if a situation requires it. One suggestion to reduce the rate of increase of bitcoin addresses is to encode an expiration into the address people are using and specify that clients enforce it. This approach could make a significant difference if used by default someday. Meanwhile, the Go Parallel Website, sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media, provides a hub for all things parallel software development, from weekly thought leadership blogs to news, videos, case studies, tutorials and more.</p>
