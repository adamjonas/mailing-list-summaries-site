    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has written two blog posts discussing the topics of replace by fee and double spending mitigations. The first post, titled "Replace by Fee Scorched Earth, a Counter Argument", presents arguments against RBF-SE and explains why it could be harmful to Bitcoin. The second post, titled "Double Spending and How to Make It Harder", summarizes a couple of double spending incidents against merchants, and then discusses several techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of double spending. These techniques include risk analysis of transactions, payment channels, countersigning by a trusted third party, remote attestation, ID verification, waiting for confirmations, and punishment of double spending blocks. While the author acknowledges that their views may not be comprehensive or unbiased, they hope that their thoughts will be useful and interesting to readers who are interested in these topics.</p>
