        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Factom is a third-party platform that aims to create a publishing platform resistant to censorship and spam. It sits between Proof of Work and a centralized solution, making it ideal for interpreted protocols while proofchains are good for audited protocols. Both are immutable and serve as proof of publication (POP). Factom allows users to choose how they audit data independent of the packager. Factom is attempting to create a dispassionate third party, while interpreted protocols like Counterparty filter out invalid transactions after the fact.The Factom protocol creates a proof-of-publication medium where facts can be published, and the token incentivizes people to maintain the infrastructure required for that medium. However, the Factom consensus layer requires trusting Factom servers, which may break the ability to prove that Factom-secured records are honest. Additionally, securing ledgers in the Bitcoin blockchain technically without using Factom is possible, although transaction fees must be paid. Threshold signatures can ensure that a majority of cities have to sign off on any updates to a meta-ledger for all their per-city property title systems. The only disadvantage to securing records directly in the blockchain is paying transaction fees. Brian Deery shared a link to an archived thread on Reddit discussing the launch of Factom's software token on a Bitcoin mailing list. Peter Todd requested that Deery explicitly list what he believes Factom prevents from happening as its primary function is security software. Todd suggested being specific about the guarantees one expects from the Factom system. Ultimately, the viability of Factom and the value of its token depend on Bitcoin transaction fees rising or people choosing to use more complex and less secure systems over simpler ones.</p>
