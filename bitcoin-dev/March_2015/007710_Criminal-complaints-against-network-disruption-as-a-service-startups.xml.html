    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group of researchers from Chainalysis used a class C IP range to determine the flow of funds between countries. Their nodes responded with valid blocks and merkle-blocks but not transactions, which caused issues for Breadwallet. The researchers now acknowledge that they should have relayed transactions and advertised addresses from "foreign" nodes. They believe it is not illegal to log incoming connections and make statistical analysis on them, though they have no intention of giving away IP addresses. The researchers also note that if nodes that do not relay transactions are a problem, then there is work to be done. In terms of legality, there are definitional issues and it may be tricky territory. It remains to be seen how this will all play out.</p>
