    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2015, multiple individuals discussed the best practices for shared wallet use cases. Devrandom suggested multi-device multi-sig, where different devices have different security profiles on different keys, and a third-party security oracle holds the third key with varying security thresholds for countersigning the mobile. Meanwhile, Mike Hearn argued for allowing users to share their wallets between devices, despite the risks of increased attack surfaces and exposure to flaws. Aaron Voisine disagreed, expressing concern over wallet seed interoperability increasing the risk of intrusion, and Gregory Maxwell emphasized the importance of minimizing gratuitous incompatibility and reducing flawed constructions in standardizing BIPs. One issue raised was the difficulty in extending BIP70 to offline cases for mobile wallets while maintaining privacy. The group also lamented the lack of standardization in phrase handling and compatibility. Finally, they promoted the Go Parallel Website, which is sponsored by Intel and developed in partnership with Slashdot Media.</p>
