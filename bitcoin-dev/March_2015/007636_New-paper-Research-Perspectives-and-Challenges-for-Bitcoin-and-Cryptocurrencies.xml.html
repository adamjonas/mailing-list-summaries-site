    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>AI Coin is an altcoin that is set to launch on April 27. It utilizes principles from the ‘Bitcoin Cooperative Proof of Stake’ whitepaper written in May 2014. Unlike other coins, AI Coin does not use staking for network-wide algorithmic trustworthiness and has a single version of blockchain appended by a single peer. Peers wrap Bitcoind instances, controlling the transaction and new block routing for scalability. The peers have self-signed X.509 certificates to encrypt messages and prevent impersonation. The tamper-evident technology used to secure Bitcoin's blockchain is extended to secure the entire network. Peers maintain tamper-evident logs inspired by an idea published by Nick Szabo, which are replayed, verified and signed by other peers. The innovation enables immediate settlement of transactions. More information can be found on their forum.</p>
