    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A team of researchers from Stanford, Maryland, Concordia, and Princeton have written a "systemization" paper about Bitcoin-related research with the goal of bridging the gap between the computer science research community and the cryptocurrency community. The paper is set to appear in the IEEE Security and Privacy conference later this year but has been announced as a draft to the public ahead of time. The team's main objective is to help some of the best ideas and research questions from the Bitcoin community bubble up, inspiring researchers to build on them. The team did not limit their scope to Bitcoin but also tried to explain all the dimensions along which altcoins and other next-generation cryptocurrency designs differ from Bitcoin. This effort took approximately two years but stopped and restarted several times along the way. The team is still open to comments and suggestions and plans to continue updating their online version for the foreseeable future. The paper can be found at <a href="http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/BMCNKF15-IEEESP-bitcoin.pdf">http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/BMCNKF15-IEEESP-bitcoin.pdf</a>.</p>
