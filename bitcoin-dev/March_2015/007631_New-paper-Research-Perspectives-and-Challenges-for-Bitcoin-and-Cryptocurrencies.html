    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group of researchers from various universities have written a paper about Bitcoin-related research that will appear in the Oakland security conference later this year. The authors' main goal was to build a bridge between the computer science research community and the cryptocurrency community. They hope their paper helps some of the best ideas and research questions from the Bitcoin community bubble up and inspires researchers to build on them. The scope of the paper is not limited to Bitcoin, but it also explains all the dimensions along which altcoins and other next-generation cryptocurrency designs differ from Bitcoin. The effort has been ongoing for around two years, though it stopped and restarted several times along the way. If anyone has comments or suggestions, they still have a week before the final version is due, and regardless they plan to continue updating their online version for the foreseeable future. Additionally, an intelligent assistant responds to a minor point made by one of the authors regarding SPV clients not needing to maintain an ever-growing list of PoW solutions.</p>
