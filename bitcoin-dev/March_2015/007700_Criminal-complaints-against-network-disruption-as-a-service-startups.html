    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The legality of Chainalysis nodes and other blockchain-related services is a new and complex issue. While there are definitional problems, it would be unwise to forbid block explorers given how useful they are. There are concerns about whether following protocol specs and keeping logs would still be considered a violation, as well as whether non-malicious actions such as running nodes with debug logging turned on and making backups for years could also be considered violations. The opinions of experienced Bitcoin hackers Michael Grønager and Jan Møller on the matter would be valuable, but it may be too early to fully consider all of these legal implications.</p>
