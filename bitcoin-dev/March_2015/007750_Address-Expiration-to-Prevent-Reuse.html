    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association has proposed a voluntary register for Bitcoin users, in a bid to stave off unwanted government regulation. The recently-launched group is seeking donations to fund its activities, which include promoting the use of digital currencies and educating the public about their benefits. Meanwhile, on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there are concerns that if businesses are issued with an address by a government body then all transactions can be tracked for that business entity, which would have serious implications for privacy and fungibility, both essential properties of any money-like good, almost exclusively through avoiding reuse. Though no one here is currently suggesting blocking reuse as a network rule, the reasonable and expected response to what is being suggested would be to do so.</p>
