    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group of researchers including Joseph Bonneau, Andrew Miller, Arvind Narayanan, Jeremy Clark, Ed Felten, and Josh Kroll have written a "systemization" paper about Bitcoin-related research. The paper aims to build a bridge between the computer science research community and the cryptocurrency community and organize the best ideas from the latter. It will appear in the Oakland security conference later this year (IEEE Security and Privacy). The researchers didn't limit their scope to Bitcoin but tried to explain all the dimensions along which next-gen cryptocurrency designs differ from Bitcoin. The effort has been in progress for roughly two years, though it stopped and restarted several times. There is still a week before the final version is due, and the online version will continue to be updated for the foreseeable future. Joichi Ito from the MIT media Lab has made reference to the work during yesterday's MIT Bitcoin Expo.</p>
