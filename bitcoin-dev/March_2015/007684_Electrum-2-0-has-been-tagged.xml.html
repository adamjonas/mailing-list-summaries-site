    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2015 email, Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn discussed the need for a common file format that can be interpreted by a library which all wallets can use. He suggested creating something extensible that can describe how to derive all addresses used by the user, including HD branches, block numbers, and known transactions related to the wallet. The format should also allow for different types of wallets, such as multisignature wallets tied to hardware wallets and those using custom extensions or stealth addresses. Additionally, there should be labels for transactions and P2SH script templates for address recovery. Hearn emphasized the importance of having an import/export format rather than just a backup format, as it would allow for the most recent metadata to be included when importing. He also suggested asking wallet developers to offer conversion tools to generate export format files from custom wallet data files.</p>
