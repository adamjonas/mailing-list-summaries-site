    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The user is developing a .NET node for communication on the P2P network and is now looking to migrate to the testnet in order to start making and validating transactions. They are currently using packet magic 0x0b110907 and have confirmed that their messages are going out with that packet magic using Wireshark. However, when they try to connect to a test node obtained from DNS seed testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org and send it a version message with the testnet3 packet magic, they get no verack or version in response and only receive a ping before the connection is severed by the remote node. The user is debugging their code and ensuring it is looking for the testnet3 packet magic but still not receiving a response from the node. The mainnet packet magic value of 0x0f9beb4d9 works fine.</p>
