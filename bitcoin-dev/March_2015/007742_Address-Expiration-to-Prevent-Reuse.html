    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on March 26, 2015, Tom Harding discussed the motivation behind address expiration for Bitcoin. He stated that the purpose of address expiration is to reduce the rate of increase in the number of Bitcoin addresses that need to be monitored for future payments. This issue has become increasingly problematic given the massive pile of Bitcoin addresses out there. Harding believed that implementing a solution like address expiration could make a significant difference if it were used by default someday.One possible solution that Harding suggested was encoding an expiration date into the Bitcoin address itself. By specifying that clients enforce this expiration, users would be forced to create new addresses periodically instead of keeping old ones active indefinitely. This would help to reduce the burden of monitoring old addresses and also prevent the buildup of unused addresses over time.Overall, the implementation of address expiration could have a positive impact on the scalability and efficiency of the Bitcoin network. While it remains to be seen whether or not this idea will be adopted in the future, it presents an interesting potential solution to a pressing problem facing the cryptocurrency community.</p>
