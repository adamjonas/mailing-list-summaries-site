    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion, Mike Hearn lists various Bitcoin wallets and their key derivation schemes. He notes that myTREZOR, Multibit HD, and GreenAddress all use BIP39, but with different key derivation schemes. Marek Palatinus disagrees with the need for version flags or creation dates stored in the mnemonic, as it would not necessarily save implementation failures, and creation dates are irrelevant in the long-term storage of cold wallets. Palatinus also highlights that wordlists do not need to be fixed between wallet providers according to BIP39 recommendations. Additionally, he notes that BIP39 has been changed to be one-way only, allowing any wordlist to be used to create a mnemonic and any other implementation to derive a BIP32 root node without knowing the particular wordlist. Finally, Palatinus believes that BIP39 does a perfect job and there is no need for anything else.</p>
