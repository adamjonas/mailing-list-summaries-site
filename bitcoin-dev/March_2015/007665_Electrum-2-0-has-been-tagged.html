    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the use of BIP39 in Electrum 2.0. One user expresses disappointment that Electrum 2.0 does not use BIP39. Another user responds that changing the word list used by BIP39 has no effect on the derived seed, and that the word list is only used to generate a mnemonic phrase. The second user also states that a word list of complete rubbish could be used as long as it is 2048 words long. There is a debate about versioning in BIP39, with one user arguing that a version number should be included in the seed phrase. Another user argues that a fixed word list is unfortunate because it prevents innovation and may lead to conflicts between languages. Thomas V., the developer of Electrum 2.0, explains that Electrum 2.0 uses a new seed derivation method that is not compatible with BIP39, but includes an explicit version number to ensure wallet interoperability.</p>
