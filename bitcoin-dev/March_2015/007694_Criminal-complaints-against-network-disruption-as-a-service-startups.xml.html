    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The recent news about Chainanalysis and other companies disrupting the Bitcoin network has led to a call for a review of the terms of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as similar legislation in other countries. While it may not be possible to stop network attacks by making them illegal, there is potential to prevent traditionally funded companies from engaging in such activities. It's also worth considering ways to make the responsibilities of network peers more explicit in the protocol, so that any entity that decides to access the network for purposes other than those for which full node operators made connection slots available will be in violation of various anti-hacking laws. There are currently no VC-funded DDoS-as-a-service companies operating openly.</p>
