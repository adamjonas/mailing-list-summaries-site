    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between ZmnSCPxj and Antoine discusses various topics related to Lightning Network (LN) and Bitcoin. They consider the possibility of splicing as a form of merged closing plus funding, which would change the short channel ID, making it a different channel. To keep channel routing-score across splicing, an alias may be needed. The privacy properties of Coinjoin traffic may be better if redirected through LN in the future. RBF and its controversies are discussed, and Electrum's default RBF setting is questioned. An issue with MuSig is that if not all participants contribute to the fees equally, there is an incentive to broadcast the highest-fee version only. They also discuss the need to nail down details of a format that could be used by other protocols such as submarine swaps and lightning loops.</p>
