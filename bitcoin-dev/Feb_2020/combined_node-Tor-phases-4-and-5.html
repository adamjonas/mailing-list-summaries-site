        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Node-Tor is a self-funded javascript implementation of the Tor protocol inside nodes and browsers. While phase 4 has been developed, it has not been fully tested or released yet. The team was about to implement phase 5 which includes elliptic crypto, Tor v3 features and WebRTC, but they are running out of funding. They are seeking funding to complete this work. Node-Tor has subtle and minimal code, representing only 1MB browserified not minified, so 500kB minified, with zero external dependencies. It anonymizes any protocol and implements direct P2P via the Tor protocol or via RendezVous (RDV) points using also Tor protocol hops to connect to them. Peers are implementing both direct P2P and RDV functions making it difficult to understand who is doing what and how many hops finally are used between the peers.It would look logical that this technology is integrated natively one day inside browsers. This is different from what the Tor Browser is doing and is not a replacement for it. Restarting such a project in months or years would be difficult despite the huge efforts for the refactoring/update/cleaning of the initial code and split into modules. It is probably still difficult to use/integrate/modify.</p>
