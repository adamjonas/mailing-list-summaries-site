        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A potential form of sabotage attack, named Purge attacks, that can be conducted by miners to create coordination disincentives among Bitcoin users has been discovered. The attack replaces the most recent blocks full of transactions with empty blocks, causing previously confirmed transactions to return into the mempool. This enables anyone with technical knowledge or access to public tools to opportunistically double-spend their transactions back to themselves. The attack is intended to undermine trust in Bitcoin's assurances regarding the future finality of transactions and disrupt the coordination process among users in response to the attack.Purge attacks do not constitute a bigger risk than other known forms of sabotage attacks but are an interesting spin where the attacker specifically targets the pre-coordination of defenders. The discussion revolves around how to prevent Purge attacks. The aim is to discourage miners from including transactions in their block that conflict with the eventually-consistent state of consensus in the mempool. It is noted that the mempool has no consensus, but it is an optimization that prevents a node from needlessly broadcasting transactions. Making consensus dependent on the state of the mempool requires that the state of the mempool at the point at which the block snapshot was taken be recorded.The attacker in a purge attack offers some users the opportunity to benefit from the attack, creating a vested interest in continuing the chain. This could make it more difficult to come to a consensus on how to deal with the attack if enough users accept the invitation to double-spend. The report provides some mitigations against sabotage attacks and can be found at <a href="https://blog.deribit.com/insights/destabilizing-bitcoin-consensus-with-purge-attacks/">https://blog.deribit.com/insights/destabilizing-bitcoin-consensus-with-purge-attacks/</a>. Feedback regarding this issue is highly appreciated.The conversation ends with M agreeing that a purge attack is a form of sabotage that compromises the integrity of previously-adequately-confirmed transactions by allowing users to double spend them. Overall, the discussion highlights the risks posed by Purge attacks and explores potential solutions to prevent such attacks from damaging the network's future ability to offer settlement assurances.ZmnSCPxj argues that getting rid of RBF is not possible because miners have an incentive to implement it. They also point out that regardless of however many blocks are attacked, it is still a censorship attack attempting to censor Bitcoin completely. The attack itself is better classified as a form of sabotage than censorship. Incentives of miners mean they will actually want to implement RBF and ignore any "convention" of RBF-flagging.Regardless of however many blocks are attacked, always remember that in the end, this is still a censorship attack: it is attempting to censor Bitcoin completely.</p>
