        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Suredbits and Crypto Garage are collaborating to develop a specification for using discreet log contracts (DLCs) in a safe, private, and interoperable manner. They aim to establish a common standard to use Bitcoin oracles by producing documents similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLTs). The goal is to enable others to easily integrate the technology into the protocol and remain compatible with standards used by other Bitcoin-related protocols like Lightning. The team hopes to create a toolbox of agreed-upon standards for future Bitcoin-related protocols to avoid duplication and facilitate library developers to reuse software for many Bitcoin-related protocols. To achieve this, they have released some working code for executing 2-outcome Discreet Log Contracts as well as documentation on how to use it. They have shared a short blog post containing a video demo of an execution. They would love if anyone interested in reviewing or contributing took a look at their work-in-progress specification. The team's secondary goal is to remain compatible with standards used by other bitcoin-related protocols, like Lightning, so that every future bitcoin-related protocol can reach for a "toolbox" of agreed standards for things like funding transactions and closing transactions. A community feedback is also solicited to agree on a common standard for using Bitcoin oracles. LL suggested that Schnorr-based DLCs can be done in two transactions, which can also be implemented in Bitcoin as it is today using ECDSA adaptor signatures, which are easier to specify and implement besides being cheaper and more private.For those who are interested in learning more about DLCs, there are several resources available, including a whitepaper, articles, and research papers. The specification repository can be found on GitHub. Overall, the team hopes to make DLCs a widely accepted and standardized tool for the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
