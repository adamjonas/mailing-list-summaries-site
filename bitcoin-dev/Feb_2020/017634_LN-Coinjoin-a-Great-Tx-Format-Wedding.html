    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard asked the Bitcoin-dev community how a Bitcoin transaction can leak protocol usage. He listed several factors that could reveal information about the transaction, including output type, spending policy, outputs ordering, nLocktime/nSequence, RBF-signaling, equal-value outputs, weird watermark, fees strategy like CPFP, and in-protocol announcements. Another potential factor is the utxo selection algorithm used by the wallet. CoinJoin was also discussed, with waxwing pointing out that for existing protocols (joinmarket's, wasabi's, samourai's) there isn't much that can be done to address this issue. However, he suggested that people should consider CoinJoinXT more seriously in a taproot/schnorr world since it addresses this exact point. The protocol allows participants to arrange the effect of coinjoin without the on-chain watermark of coinjoin through a short interaction. The taproot/schnorr part is required because multisig is needed from transaction to transaction in that protocol.</p>
