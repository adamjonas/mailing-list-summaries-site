    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list involved the ways in which a Bitcoin transaction can leak protocol usage. Some of the factors that can lead to protocol leakage include output type, spending policy, output ordering, nLocktime/nSequence, RBF-signaling, equal-value outputs, LN commitment tx obfuscated commitment number, fees strategy like CPFP and in-protocol announcements. Another factor is utxo selection algorithm, which may be difficult to deduce but not impossible. CoinJoinXT was suggested as a possible solution for privacy enhancement in a Taproot/Schnorr world, as it addresses the exact point of avoiding on-chain watermark of coinjoin. While existing protocols such as joinmarket's, Wasabi's, and samourai's are limited in this area, CoinJoinXT allows participants to arrange the effect of coinjoin without the on-chain watermark through a short interaction. The implementation of multisig from transaction to transaction in that protocol requires Taproot/Schnorr, making it less interesting to do it today. The author suggests specifying this now as it would take a fair amount of time/coordination to get adopted, enabling users to start enjoying the privacy enhancement when Taproot/Schnorr happens, with 2p-ecdsa as fallback.</p>
