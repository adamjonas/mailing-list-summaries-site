    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussed self-containment rule is meant to be violated intentionally, but this can cause persistent chainsplits that may lead to a worse consequence than any purge attack. Purge attacks can still be defended against and do not require mass cooperation as users can offer increased mining fees for transactions being censored to convince non-censoring miners to mine those transactions. However, the attack itself is better classified as a form of sabotage than censorship, and trying to defend in a bidding war against an opportunist attacker retrieving spent Bitcoin via RBF is not a winning game. Miners risk persistent stable chainsplits if they violate the self-containment rule. The best solution is to wait for more than a small number of confirmations before accepting a transaction.</p>
