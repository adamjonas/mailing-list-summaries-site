    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the use of blockchain for establishing identities and as a "root CA" to sign arbitrary certificates. The author suggests that signing the root in the DNS tree requires more effort than building a CA off the bitcoin blockchain. To associate identifiers for payment addresses, the writer suggests putting those in DNSSEC signed records in the DNS. For routing around x.509 CAs, participation in the DANE working group in the IETF is recommended. The email includes a link to a Github repository with a technical specification and full-length examples for using bitcoin certificates and payment protocols. The examples have been carried out on testnet3. Payment methods include static bitcoin addresses, client-side derived payment addresses (pay-to-contract), and pay-to-contract with multisig destinations (P2SH).</p>
