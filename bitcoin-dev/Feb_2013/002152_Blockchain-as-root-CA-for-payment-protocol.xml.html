    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation from February 9th, 2013, Timo Hanke and Luke-Jr discuss using Namecoin or another alt-chain to establish an identity for a payment protocol. Hanke explains that Namecoin is designed to solve a different problem - namely, domain name resolution via blockchain technology. Instead, he wants to create a new namespace for payments. Luke-Jr suggests that this could still be accomplished with an alt-chain, which Hanke acknowledges is possible but may not be as strong as Bitcoin due to potential issues with cross-mining. Additionally, if the alt-chain disappears, there may be no way to prove that old Bitcoin transactions went to valid addresses. If the identity system is based in Bitcoin's blockchain, however, it will be possible to track transactions as long as Bitcoin exists.</p>
