    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion thread is focused on the development and testing of Bitcoinj code for Android builds. Andreas has uploaded Android builds that use the new bloom filtering and peer selection code, which resulted in significant performance gains. The app syncs faster and has a better start-up time. There is a plan to release it after more testing and after Bitcoin 0.8 comes out to avoid overloading 0.7 snapshot nodes. The next step would be optimizing disk accesses as current bitcoinj is very inefficient in how it writes. Matt Corallo made a minor algorithmic change to the way the hash function is computed. His latest code has been tested by Andreas and works correctly. The discussion also touches upon profiling and missed optimization in the code, which can come post-0.8.</p>
