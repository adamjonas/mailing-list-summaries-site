    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Petr, a Bitcoin developer, is seeking feedback from the community regarding his plan to implement trading across chains in a P2P manner. He specifically references Mike Hearn's example of trading across chains and notes that this implementation is intended more as an alternative chain development rather than a merge back into the main client. Petr mentions Open Transactions, which can also do multicurrency trading, but he prefers to make relatively small changes in the mainline Bitcoin client rather than diving into something new. According to Petr, this project is part of his research towards his Master's thesis on multicurrency (alternative chains) in Bitcoin. He hopes to use this project as an excuse to hack on Bitcoin and sell it as research. Petr ends his message by acknowledging that he hopes his question is not too off-topic but cites a thread indicating that it should be fine to post alternative development questions on that platform.</p>
