        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the future, fees will be the primary source of income for miners. This may lead to large miners intentionally attempting to mine a block that would orphan the current best block to increase their profits. However, this strategy is limited by the number of transactions that can fit into a block. The best strategy for miners is to accept and move on. To defeat this strategy, clients should create their transactions with nLockTime set such that only the next block can include the transaction or even farther into the future if the transaction is not time-sensitive. With nLockTime, to get ahead, one needs to mine two blocks, and the first block could only gain the transactions in the block it orphans. A conversation between Peter Todd and an anonymous source in 2013 revealed that if there is a sufficient backlog or immature nlocktime of transactions with fees beyond the maximum block size, the incentive to orphan blocks to take their fees is greatly reduced or eliminated. While a 1000BTC fee transaction is one possibility, more realistic examples could arise due to a large number of transactions with decent fees. Using nLockTime in this way does not harm clients and provides benefits in the future. Clients can protect themselves from any potential loss due to miners' deliberate actions by using nLockTime.</p>
