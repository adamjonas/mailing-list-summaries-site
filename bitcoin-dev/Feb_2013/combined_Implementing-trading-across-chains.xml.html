        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2013, a discussion thread emerged amongst Bitcoin developers regarding the implementation of trading across chains in a P2P manner. Petr Praus expressed his interest in this area as part of his research towards his Master's thesis on multicurrency in Bitcoin. He sought feedback from the community and referenced Mike Hearn's example of trading across chains. Jorge Timón responded to Petr's post by suggesting two related projects that he thought could be of interest to him. The first was Colored Coins, which allows satoshis to represent smart property, shares, IOUs of other currencies, and can be traded atomically for Bitcoin. The second was Ripple, a concept where people who trust each other on a network can pay with IOUs transitively, and has a new P2P implementation similar to Bitcoin but without mining.Petr tried using Ripple but found out that it didn't have any contract enforcement built-in. However, he still believed that trading across chains was an important feature to have. He did not plan to merge it back into the main Bitcoin client, but rather implement it as an alternative chain development. He also mentioned Open Transactions, which can do multicurrency trading but is quite ambitious. If it's possible to trade across "chains" with Ripple, users will have to wait for the release of the full node (validator) code since only a JavaScript web client was open-sourced at the time of the discussion. Nonetheless, it seems Ripple has plans for contracts judging from their wiki. The email thread provides a useful discussion of various related projects and their potential applications in implementing trading across chains in a P2P manner. It highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing such a feature and sheds light on the different approaches that developers are taking to tackle this problem.</p>
