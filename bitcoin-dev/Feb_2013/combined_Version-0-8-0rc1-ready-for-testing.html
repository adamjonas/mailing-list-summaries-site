        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin version 0.8.0 release candidate 1 has been launched for download from the Sourceforge website. The new release is aimed at handling the growing number of transactions on the network and improving its performance. It no longer maintains a full index of historical transaction ids by default, making it impossible to search an arbitrary transaction with the getrawtransaction RPC call. New features include Mac and Windows binaries signed with certificates owned by the Bitcoin Foundation, to be compatible with the new security features in OSX 10.8 and Windows 8. LevelDB, a fast, open-source, non-relational database from Google, is now used to store transaction and block indices.Pieter Wuille implemented many optimizations to the way transactions are verified, so a running, synchronized node uses much less memory and does much less I/O. Parallel signature checking has also been implemented, so if you have a multi-CPU machine all CPUs will be used to verify transactions.There are some important bug fixes in this release. One of them was related to the position of the “change” output in most transactions which was not being properly randomized, making network analysis of the transaction graph to identify users' wallets easier. Another bug fix makes it a little bit more difficult for attackers to double-spend a certain type ("lockTime in the future") of zero-confirmation transaction. The release notes include instructions on how to upgrade to the new version.To upgrade to the new version, shut down any older version and wait until it has completely shut down. Then run the installer (on Windows) or copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoin-qt (on Linux). The first time you run after the upgrade, a re-indexing process will be started that will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. If you have enough memory, running with the -dbcache setting (e.g. -dbcache=1000 ) may make re-indexing faster. Overall, the new Bitcoin release is expected to improve its performance and handle the growing volume of transactions on its network.</p>
