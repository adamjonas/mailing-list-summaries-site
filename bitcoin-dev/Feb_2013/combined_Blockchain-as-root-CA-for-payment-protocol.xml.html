        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Timo Hanke has drafted a general specification for Bitcoin certificates that allow for various payment protocols and new signatures under the certificates. The Bitcoind program was patched to handle certificates, submit signatures to the blockchain, verify certificates against the blockchain, pay directly to certificates with different payment methods, and revoke certificates. Signatures in the blockchain are stored entirely in the UTXO set, making signature lookup and verification reasonably fast.In a conversation from February 9th, 2013, Timo Hanke and Luke-Jr discuss using Namecoin or another alt-chain to establish an identity for a payment protocol. Hanke explains that Namecoin is designed to solve a different problem - namely, domain name resolution via blockchain technology. Instead, he wants to create a new namespace for payments. Luke-Jr suggests that this could still be accomplished with an alt-chain, which Hanke acknowledges is possible but may not be as strong as Bitcoin due to potential issues with cross-mining. Additionally, if the alt-chain disappears, there may be no way to prove that old Bitcoin transactions went to valid addresses.In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Timo Hanke proposed to establish an identity for a payment protocol using a new namespace rather than tying names to data like Namecoin does. The technical difference between the two is not significant; it is the different use that can result in different security demands. Hanke suggests that DNS has a lower demand than payment ids have, and therefore, DNS data can be in a chain with a hashrate lower than Bitcoin's hashrate. Payment ids meant for Bitcoin, on the other hand, must be in a chain with equal hashrate. Hanke also discusses merging the new chain with Bitcoin's blockchain.The email thread shared among developers discusses the possibility of using blockchain for establishing identities and as a "root CA" to sign arbitrary certificates. The author suggests that signing the root in the DNS tree requires more effort than building a CA off the bitcoin blockchain. To associate identifiers for payment addresses, the writer suggests putting those in DNSSEC signed records in the DNS. Hanke proposes using a payment base address as a universal identifier instead of domain names. The pay-to-contract principle is explained, where authenticated communication is not necessary when paying, so funds are never lost even if ordered from the wrong website.However, Peter Todd argues that using the UTXO set will encourage squatting behavior and create significant costs to the network. He suggests working on Namecoin to make it more usable while adding some PKI to it using the same domain names. Moreover, he proposes storing the alt-chain block header hashes outside the UTXO as storing all the data in the UTXO would mean users need to have the entire blockchain available, which is not desirable.Todd's suggestion leads to a consensus that storing the alt-chain block header hashes outside the UTXO is better than storing all the data in the UTXO. Payment methods such as static bitcoin addresses, client-side derived payment addresses (pay-to-contract), and pay-to-contract with multisig destinations (P2SH) are discussed, with examples carried out on testnet3.Ultimately, the email thread presents different perspectives on the use of blockchain technology to establish identities and payment methods. While Hanke proposes using payment base addresses as a universal identifier, Todd suggests improving Namecoin to make it more user-friendly. The discussion on storage of alt-chain block header hashes leads to a consensus that storing them outside the UTXO is better. The email also shares a link to a Github repository with a technical specification and full-length examples for using bitcoin certificates and payment protocols.</p>
