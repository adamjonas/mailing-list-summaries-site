        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ruben Somsen has proposed a design for fully decentralized two-way peg sidechains called Softchains. This mechanism requires a soft fork to activate new sidechains, and all softchains are validated by everyone via Proof-of-Work Fraud Proofs (PoW FP), which is a consensus mechanism that only requires the validation of disputed blocks. PoW FP provides a low-bandwidth way of determining if a chain, and thus a peg-out, is valid. Peg-ins occur by freezing coins on the mainchain and assigning them to a softchain, while peg-outs occur by creating a mainchain transaction that points to a peg-out transaction on a softchain and waiting for a sufficient number of mainchain confirmations.Potential dangers include non-deterministic consensus bugs and major reorgs, but these risks can be mitigated by basing softchain designs on Bitcoin Core and introducing a rule disallowing reorgs bigger than half the peg-out time. Softchain consensus still requires validation from mainchain users, with consensus bugs potentially causing a chain split. Each softchain must produce a non-trivial amount of PoW to maintain security and prevent cost reductions in creating forks. Merged mining could help maintain security, but it would also put an additional validation burden on miners.The peg-in/peg-out mechanism itself would require a soft fork, and every softchain that gets activated will also require a soft fork. Softchain consensus still requires validation from mainchain users, with consensus bugs potentially causing a chain split. Ruben believes that this proposal could provide more opt-in block space and open the door to chains with entirely different consensus rules, but it may turn out to be prohibitively risky. Softchain consensus still requires a form of validation from mainchain users, which means that consensus bugs can have an adverse effect. It is important that each softchain produces a non-trivial amount of PoW because if the difficulty is too low, the cost of creating forks and increasing the resource usage of PoW FP consensus goes down. Ruben Somsen proposes this idea to provide more opt-in block space and potentially open the door to chains with entirely different consensus rules. However, it may turn out that the consensus risks outlined above make this prohibitively risky, and the author invites feedback on issues that they might have overlooked and ideas on mitigating problems to ensure maximum safety.</p>
