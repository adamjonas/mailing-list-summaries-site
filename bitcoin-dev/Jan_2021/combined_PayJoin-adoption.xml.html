        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>exchange due to new regulations highlights the urgent need for increased adoption of PayJoin. If PayJoin is widely adopted, it can help ensure that crypto remains permissionless money for the internet. While implementing PayJoin directly with companies/in respective software repositories seems like a strong first step for greater adoption, it is not enough. The lack of PayJoin adoption may be due to the lack of visibility. To increase awareness and adoption of PayJoin, efforts should be made to push merchants towards accepting Bitcoin specifically via software like BTCPayServer, which already supports PayJoin.PayJoin adoption is being tracked on a wiki page similar to the Bech32 adoption page. Directly contributing to the software by writing an implementation is the most helpful but harder option. However, one of the barriers to greater PayJoin adoption is the need for a server endpoint on the receiving side, according to a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Ideally, all wallets should be able to conduct Payjoin transactions with each other without the need for a server endpoint on the receiving side.The economic incentives to use PayJoin are not significant compared to the privacy benefits, which are beneficial for the global transactions graph as a whole. This means that PayJoin requires some level of altruistic attitude from payers. The UX of PayJoin is also not optimal because most users are not familiar with bip21 uris. Wallets' developers should make PayJoin payment by default because it is the right thing to do to fight against surveillance aimed at spying on Bitcoin users and improve Bitcoin's fungibility. In that case, it should be completely transparent to the users and not cost anything.Recently, a UK Bitcoin exchange shut down due to new regulations, with the owner writing a blog post about the issue. The post highlighted that using entities that are paranoid about keeping their coins clean and adhering to all the regulations can increase risk scores, making it difficult to use personal wallets or donate to someone online. As people use entities that are paranoid about keeping their coins clean and adhering to all the regulations, their risk scores will continue to increase, and without even knowing why, their deposits may become rejected, they may be asked to supply documents or lose the coins, and their account may become suspended without them having any clue what they did wrong.The author of PayJoin recently thanked the creator of a Wiki page tracking its adoption. Despite the economic benefits of using SegWit transactions, many users have yet to adopt the technology. While PayJoin offers privacy benefits for the global transactions graph as a whole, it requires an altruistic attitude from payers, and its user experience is not optimal since many users are not familiar with bip21 uris.PayJoin is already implemented in several projects such as BTCPayServer, Wasabi Wallet, JoinMarket, and BlueWallet, and a protocol standard has been defined. One exchange that has already adopted PayJoin is a no-signup altcoin exchange called sideshift.ai. P2P exchanges are expected and hoped to be one of the earlier adopters.</p>
