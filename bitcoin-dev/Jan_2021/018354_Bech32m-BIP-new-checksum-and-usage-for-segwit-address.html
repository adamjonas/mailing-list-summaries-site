    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to Pieter Wuille, Takatoshi Nakagawa has written that he read the BIP draft of Bech32m and implemented it in Go. He then asked if the Checksum has to be fixed or not. Takatoshi suggested that the 'bech32_verify_checksum' function which has hrp and data as parameters could commit checksum with these two values. He proposed calculating the checksum from hrp and data using hash, chacha20, etc. Pieter Wuille had previously shared a BIP draft for changing the checksum in native segwit addresses for v1 and higher, following the discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list. The overall idea is to define a new encoding which is a tweaked variant of Bech32 called Bech32m. This new format would be used for v0 witness addresses and other versions while Bech32 remains in effect for BIP173. Wuille has invited comments, suggestions, and ideas on this proposal.</p>
