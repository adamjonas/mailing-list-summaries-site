    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Suhas Daftuar has proposed the addition of a new optional p2p message to allow peers to communicate that they do not want to send or receive transactions for the lifetime of a connection. The goal is to facilitate connections on the network over which only block-related data are relayed, creating low-resource connections that help protect against partition attacks on the network. The specification mentions that a node that has sent or received a disabletx message to/from a peer must not send any inv messages for transactions and that it is recommended that nodes not send addr/getaddr or addrv2 (BIP 155) messages to the peer. However, Andrew Jackson suggests separating the ideas of the protocol change to indicate that you don't want transactions and the policy change to protect against partition attacks using that protocol addition. He believes that combining these doesn't make sense for nodes running with -blocksonly and non-listening nodes running with -connect to one/more preselected peers. Therefore, he suggests making the protocol more flexible by introducing DISABLETX and DISABLEADDR.</p>
