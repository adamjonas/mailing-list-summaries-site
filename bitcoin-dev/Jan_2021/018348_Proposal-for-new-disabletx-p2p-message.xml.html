    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev discussion, Matt Corallo raised the question about the disabling of bloom filters and fRelay interaction. Anthony Towns responded by stating that in the current Bitcoin implementation, there is no way to enable fRelay later if bloom filters are disabled on a connection. Bloom filter support is indicated through a service bit in BIP 111 and can be assumed as soon as the VERSION line is received. BIP 37 specifies fRelay as a boolean value that determines whether broadcast transactions will be announced until a filter command is received or not. BIP 60 references BIP 37 and defines the field as "relay". It is important to note that dropping all bloom support would result in killing two birds with one stone as precomputed filters are provided via P2P connections.</p>
