    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>PayJoin is a bitcoin privacy technology that could negatively impact the ability of blockchain surveillance to spy on bitcoin users and damage bitcoin's fungibility. Protocol standards have already been defined and implemented by various projects such as BTCPayServer, Wasabi Wallet, JoinMarket, and BlueWallet. Adoption of PayJoin can be tracked on a wiki page similar to the Bech32 adoption page. A UK-based bitcoin exchange recently shut down due to new regulations. The owner wrote an interesting blog post explaining how using marketplaces and Coinjoin are considered high-risk activities. As risk scores continue to increase, users may experience rejected deposits, account suspension, and requests for documents without knowing why. This trend may cause people to become afraid of using personal wallets, receiving bitcoins from unregulated exchanges, and donating online. To fulfill the dream of permissionless money for the internet, it is crucial to work on increasing adoption of PayJoin.</p>
