    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is from Rusty, who expresses excitement over the progress of a project he seems to be involved in. He apologizes for delayed feedback and provides some input regarding an additional global field he'd like to add. The field is called PSBT_GLOBAL_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION, which is used to signal whether inputs and outputs can be added to the PSBT. This flag may be set to True when inputs and outputs are being updated, signed, and finalized. However, care must be taken when there are existing signatures. If this field is omitted or set to False, no further inputs and outputs may be added to the PSBT.Rusty wonders if this can be flagged simply by omitting the redundant fields PSBT_GLOBAL_INPUT_COUNT and PSBT_GLOBAL_OUTPUT_COUNT. He also suggests that such an under-construction PSBT should not be signed and proposes changing the name to PBT (Partial Bitcoin Transaction) since it's more than just signing. Finally, he mentions that for their uses, there would be no signatures at this stage; it's simply a subdivision of the Creator role, which would be terminated by removing the under-construction marker.</p>
