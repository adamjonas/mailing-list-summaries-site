    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses improvements that would benefit everyone, and some that are more suitable for "layer 2" or pre-signed transactions protocols. The goal is to spark discussions and hopefully iterate to a more secure and more usable hardware ecosystem for all bitcoiners. The proposed improvements include displaying the Bitcoin Script itself when possible (including the unlock conditions), knowing pubkeys or xpubs it does not hold the private keys for, and display a label, making Bitcoin HW actually compatible with Bitcoin, keeping track of inputs already signed once for protocols that require it, and adding a way to check that a "clawback" has been signed first, with the same input. The author believes most of these points are a must-have for any decent security. Revault does not plan on building hardware wallets, but hopes existing and upcoming manufacturers will implement strong security that could be used for the Revault protocol users.</p>
