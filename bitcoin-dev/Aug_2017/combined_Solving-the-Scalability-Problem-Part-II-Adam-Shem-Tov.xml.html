        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The issue of storage space and scalability in Bitcoin has been a recurring problem over the years. On August 26, 2017, Adam Tamir Shem-Tov proposed a solution to this problem by minimizing the blocks on the blockchain without losing any relevant information. However, changing the transaction and block chain requires knowing the private key of the sender of funds for each account, which is not feasible.To overcome this challenge, Shem-Tov suggested creating a special account called the "Genesis Account," with its public and private keys available to everyone but unable to send or receive any funds in a normal block. The Genesis Account would only be used in the pruning block or Exodus Block when creating the new pruned block chain and transaction chain.All funds in the Exodus Block need to be legitimate, and it would be difficult to legitimize them unless they were sent from a verified account with a public and private key that can be verified. Therefore, the Genesis Account would appear as though all funds originated and were sent from it using its private key to generate each transaction. To expand the number of Bitcoins, the funds in the Genesis Account would also need to expand. Shem-Tov suggested showing as though the Genesis Account is the account mining the coins, and it would be the only account in the Exodus Block "mining" the coins and receiving the mining bonus. In the Exodus Block, all coins mined by the real miners would show as though they were mined by Genesis and sent to the miners through a regular transaction.The proposal aims to solve the issue of storage space becoming too expensive for private citizens to afford, making Bitcoin the worst decentralized or uncentralized system in history. The Genesis Account would also help prevent fraud and ensure the validity of the Exodus Block. Shem-Tov believes it is time to stop ignoring the issue of storage space and realize that something needs to change. Despite being discussed in several threads over the past six years, the proposal has not been acted upon yet.</p>
