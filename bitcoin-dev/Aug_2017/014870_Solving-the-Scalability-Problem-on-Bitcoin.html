    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, the sender proposes a solution to the problem of node pruning in Bitcoin. The proposed solution involves adding a Genesis Account, which would be the new sender for transactions. The idea is to remove all intermediate origins and make the funds untraceable and unverifiable. To fix this issue, a new transaction needs to replace old ones, which would require A's private key. In order to make this publicly implemented, the key needs to be public so that any node creating this Exodus Block can sign with it. The sender suggests keeping 10 older blocks, but is open to debate on this number. They also mention that the number 1000, which they suggested earlier, was arbitrary. The problem with node pruning is that it is not standardized, and for a new node to enter the network and verify the data, it needs to download all data and prune it by itself. This process would drastically lower the information needed by the full nodes by getting rid of the unnecessary data. Currently, the size of Bitcoin's data is around 140GB and is increasing exponentially due to the number of users and transactions created. It could reach a terabyte sooner than expected, which is why action needs to be taken now.</p>
