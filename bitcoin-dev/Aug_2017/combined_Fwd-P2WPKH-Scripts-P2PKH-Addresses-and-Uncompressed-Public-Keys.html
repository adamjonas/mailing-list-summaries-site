        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alex Nagy asked whether it is safe for Bob to issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice when she provides him with a specific address. The response was that paying people to a script pubkey they did not specify is not possible and constructing an alternative one that they did not specify could be considered unsafe and flawed.Wallets may sometimes display outputs they did not generate but could spend due to technical issues, but this is not a generic case. It is impossible for wallets to determine what they did or did not issue because of durability to backup recovery. Therefore, wallets will not see the payment, and even if the recipient is informed of it, they may have no mechanism to recover it. Using an uncompressed key could also make it unspendable later on.</p>
