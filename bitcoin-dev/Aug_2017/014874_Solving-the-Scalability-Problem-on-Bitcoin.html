    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There may be a problem with the concept of pruning in Bitcoin due to the fact that wallets, particularly those made by third-party software, do not always fully empty. Even if instructed to send all funds, some wallets leave a small fraction of Bitcoin remaining. This could lead to difficulties in pruning, as wallets with any coins left cannot be pruned. For example, if A has 1 BTC and sends it to B, who then sends it to C, but both wallets do not remove all of the BTC, B will not be able to be pruned out of the chain. To address this issue, people need to be persuaded to get their wallets to send everything instead of leaving a small fraction left over. It is unclear how problematic this could be or how frequently it happens.</p>
