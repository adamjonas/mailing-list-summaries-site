    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made by Алексей Мутовкин via bitcoin-dev on August 16, 2017, to split the Bitcoin blockchain database (BBD) annually into two parts. The reason for this proposed improvement is that having a 140gb full wallet is inconvenient. The first part consists of old blocks before the date of the split and the second part comprises new blocks starting from the first technical block with all rolled totals on the date of the split. The proposal also includes the transfer of tiny totals due to their unprofitability to miners, which cuts the long tail of tiny holders. Additionally, old blocks packs into annual megablocks and stores in the side archive chain for some needs for FBI investigations or other goals. To implement this routine, one would need to explain not only *why* it is necessary but also *what specifically* to do and *how* to do it. This concept, historically known as "flip the chain" and/or "UTXO commitments," is not new, merely complicated to design and implement.</p>
