    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by Алексей Мутовкин via bitcoin-dev to improve the Bitcoin blockchain database (BBD) size. The proposal suggests an annual split of the BBD, where old blocks before the date of split will be stored separately from new blocks starting from the first technical block with all rolled totals on the date of split. This approach is believed to be better than pruning, which involves deleting old transactions to reduce the blockchain size. In addition to splitting the BBD, tiny totals may be transferred to miners to cut long tail of tiny holders. Old blocks will be packed into annual megablocks and stored in the side archive chain for future needs such as FBI investigations or other goals. Overall, the proposed approach aims to address the inconvenience of a large 140gb full wallet.</p>
