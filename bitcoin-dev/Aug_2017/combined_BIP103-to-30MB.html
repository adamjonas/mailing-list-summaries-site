        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The given context talks about a formula that uses a decaying percentage and takes around 100 years to reach the limit of 30MB. The limit of 32 is never exceeded, except in case of another hard fork. This schedule allows for the block size to scale with technological growth asymptotically. The formula used here is P=17%, Pn = P*0.95, X = 1, Xn = X * (1+P).The mentioned formula uses a decaying percentage which means that the decrease in size occurs gradually over time. After a certain point, the limit of 30MB is reached, and it never goes beyond that. Even though the limit of 32 is present, it is not crossed unless a hard fork occurs. This helps in maintaining stability and consistency in the blockchain.The main advantage of using this formula is that it enables the block size to scale with technological advancements. As technology evolves, the size of blocks can increase accordingly without affecting the stability of the network. This provides a long-term solution for the scalability problem faced by many blockchain networks.In conclusion, the use of a formula with a decaying percentage has proven to be an effective solution for scaling block sizes in blockchain networks. With its ability to adapt to technological growth, it allows for consistent and stable performance while ensuring long-term scalability.</p>
