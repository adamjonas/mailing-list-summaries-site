    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the idea of removing stale coins at a certain block height in order to keep the mining rewards up and encourage people to keep moving their money around. Chris Riley raises concern about this idea, stating that it goes against the idea of being your own bank and controlling your own money. He gives an example of Hal Finney, who was cryo-preserved at Alcor, and how he may expect his coins to be there but find out they were deemed "stale" and reclaimed. Thomas suggests that moving the coins once every ten years or so could prevent such a situation from happening. Erik Aronesty agrees with the idea of removing stale coins only in the event of a quantum computing threat to the security of Bitcoin. Matthew Beton proposes removing stale coins at a certain block height and burning them up, which would keep mining rewards up and encourage people to keep moving their money around the economy instead of hoarding it.</p>
