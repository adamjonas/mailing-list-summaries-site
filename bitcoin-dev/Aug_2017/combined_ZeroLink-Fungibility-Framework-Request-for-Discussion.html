        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZeroLink is a project aimed at providing complete anonymity on the Bitcoin blockchain. It combines and organizes all the research on Bitcoin privacy and defines a pre-mix wallet that can be incorporated into any Bitcoin wallet with minimal implementation overhead. Post-mix wallets have strong privacy requirements to ensure that mixed out coins do not lose their uniformity. The Wallet Privacy Framework defines the requirements and recommendations for both types of wallets. Coins are moved from pre-mix wallets to post-mix wallets through mixing, which can be done using most on-chain mixing techniques. However, ZeroLink also includes its own mixing technique called Chaumian CoinJoin, which is considered the most performant, fastest, and cheapest one. The project covers many topics, including mixing technique, coin selection, private transaction and balance retrieval, transaction input and output indexing, broadcasting, and UX recommendations. The goal of ZeroLink is to ensure users' privacy is not breached on the blockchain or network level. Several Bitcoin wallets have committed to implementing and complying with ZeroLink, including SamouraiWallet and HiddenWallet, while BreezeWallet has shown significant interest in the project. The proposal can be found on GitHub.</p>
