    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation on bitcoin-dev, Gregory Maxwell suggested that improvements can be made to reduce the size of headers in Bitcoin. He pointed out that the bits field can only change every 2016 blocks, the timestamp cannot be less than the median of the last 11, and the block version is usually one of the last few. These changes would save a few bytes per header. However, he mentioned that these improvements are just a constant factor. Maxwell suggested using compact SPV proofs described in the appendix of the sidechains whitepaper which creates log scaling proofs. Kalle Rosenbaum also chimed in and shared his blog post on compact SPV proofs, which offers more insight into this topic.</p>
