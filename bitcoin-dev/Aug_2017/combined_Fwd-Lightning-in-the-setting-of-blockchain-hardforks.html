        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers are discussing the issue of payment channels during a hardfork and how to handle open channels during a fork. In cases where channels are open during the fork, a single channel is opened and will have to be settled twice. If no replay protection was implemented on the fork, then the last commitment can be used to close the channel. However, if replay protection was implemented then commitments become invalid on the fork and people may lose money. The suggestion was made to change the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and require replay and wipe-out protection to solve this problem. It was questioned whether these requirements could be relaxed and if slow block times would pose an issue. It was also suggested that timestamping of commitments could be integrated into the channel design as a possible solution to replay protection. It was acknowledged that hardforking while having open channels will always be problematic and anyone unaware of the hardfork or updating their client too late risks losing their money. The discussion also includes whether Lightning can transact on "almost frozen" block chains suffering from a sudden loss of hash power, and whether there have been any previous discussions or studies of Lightning in the setting of hardforks.Christian Decker welcomes Martin Schwarz to the Lightning-dev mailing list and agrees with his proposal of using the first forked block as the forkchain's genesis block to avoid disruption. Bryan's contact information is provided at the bottom of the email thread. Overall, the discussion focuses on addressing the challenges posed by hardforks in relation to Lightning transactions and payment channels.</p>
