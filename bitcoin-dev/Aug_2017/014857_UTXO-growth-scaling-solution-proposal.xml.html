    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Thomas Guyot-Sionnest and other Bitcoin developers discussed the proposal of implementing a system where coins expire after a certain number of years. The discussion raised concerns about the risks associated with forcing individuals to bring their offline coins back online, which poses inherent security risks. To implement such a system, the entire ecosystem would require several years of warning, transparency, and absolute radical change. Additionally, it was suggested that creating a "never expire" transaction output should also be considered in case such a feature is seriously proposed. The discussion also touched on how this issue should not be conflated with the discussion about what to do when ECC or SHA256 is broken. Finally, the email also discussed the argument that individuals cannot be their own bank, and the requirement for individuals to move their coins every ten years or so to ensure they won't come back years later and complain that their addresses have been scavenged.</p>
