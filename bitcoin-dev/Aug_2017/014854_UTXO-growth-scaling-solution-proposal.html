    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this message thread revolves around the potential for Bitcoin to be secure and usable for a long period of time, even as technology advances. One member suggests that both SHA256 and existing wallet formats may not survive 200 years due to advances in quantum computing and Moore's Law. They propose a solution in the form of a PoW change using Keccak and a flexible number of bits, which could be designed as a "future hard fork." Additionally, they suggest introducing new address formats and signing protocols with a flexible number of bits and a configurable maximum number of bits. The maximum number of supported bits can be trivially changed, and these can be made immediately available but completely optional. Finally, the POW difficulty can be used to inform the expiration of any addresses that can be compromised within 5 years assuming this power was somehow used to compromise them.</p>
