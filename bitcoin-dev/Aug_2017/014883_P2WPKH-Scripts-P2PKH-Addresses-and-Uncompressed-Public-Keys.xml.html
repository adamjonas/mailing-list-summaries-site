    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to Gregory Maxwell, Alex Nagy asked if Bob could safely issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice if Alice gives him 1MsHWS1BnwMc3tLE8G35UXsS58fKipzB7a. Gregory replied that it's not possible to pay people to a script pubkey that they have not specified and constructing an alternative one would be like paying someone by putting a cheque in a locked safe labeled "danger radioactive" that you quietly bury in their back yard. Technical reasons led to some wallets sometimes displaying some outputs they didn't generate but could spend, but these cases are flaws that cannot be used for all cases. Uncompressed keys could also render the payment unspendable.</p>
