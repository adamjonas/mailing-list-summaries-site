    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first paragraph discusses the issue of full RBF and its impact on transactions made by wallets. While technically simple to transition to, there is uncertainty about the path forward for stakeholders. The opt-in RBF policy is problematic for retail wallets, and alternative solutions may be necessary.The second paragraph provides an overview of AngelList, a website connecting startups with investors and job seekers. It was founded in 2010 and has since become a popular platform with over 1 million registered users and $2 billion in reported investments. In addition to connecting startups with investors, AngelList also offers a job board for startups looking to hire employees.One notable feature of AngelList is its Syndicates program, allowing smaller investors to participate in deals alongside larger, more experienced investors. Overall, AngelList has become an important player in the startup ecosystem, providing a platform for startups to connect with investors and find top talent. Its success has made it a go-to destination for anyone involved in the startup world.</p>
