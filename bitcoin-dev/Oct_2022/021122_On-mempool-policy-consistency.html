    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, bitcoin developers are discussing the inclusion of a full-RBF option in the protocol. While some argue that this option could be removed later to prevent negative impacts on compact blocks, others suggest that it may be better to have a uniform transition to avoid degradation of fast block propagation. The implementation of compact blocks already efficiently deals with instances where miners have different policies than nodes. As such, occasional full-RBF replacements should not have much impact, as nodes that had full-RBF disabled will forward transactions to their peers directly. Overall, discussions focus on ensuring smooth transitions and minimizing latency impact on the network.</p>
