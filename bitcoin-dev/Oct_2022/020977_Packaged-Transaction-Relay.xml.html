    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is centered around the implementation of sendaddrv2 messages and the version constraints associated with it. While BIP155 defines addrv2 and sendaddrv2 for all protocol versions, some implementations reject messages they don't know. As a courtesy, the messages are therefore not sent to nodes with a version before 70016, as no software is known to support BIP155 that doesn't announce at least that protocol version number. The version string in the log message implies that it may not be a Core release, yet it is BIP155 compliant. However, it is pointed out that protocol cannot be defined on an ad-hoc basis as a "courtesy" - and it's not exactly a courtesy to keep yourself from getting dropped by peers. It is suggested that authors update BIP155 and BIP330 (both still in Draft status), as well as any pending proposals that may have picked up this pattern from BIP155. The discussion also touches upon Bitcoin's P2P protocol versioning, which has been criticized for its complexity. While there has been a proposal to update it, it hasn't been a priority. The author invites anyone interested in collaborating on it to contact them directly.</p>
