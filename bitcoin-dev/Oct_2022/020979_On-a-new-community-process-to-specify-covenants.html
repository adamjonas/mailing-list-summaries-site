    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first part of the context is an email proposing the creation of a new decentralized, open, and neutral community process for Bitcoin contracting primitives R&D. The communication channel proposed is IRC on Libera Chat, with meetings scheduled to take place between 16:00 UTC and 21:00 UTC. The author has created a GitHub repository to collect and document all known contracting protocol use-cases. The author believes that a covenant working group could yield one common contracting primitives toolchain servicing all the known use-cases. The author proposes a new covenant open specification process, in the same spirit as we have with the BOLTs or dlcspecs, with regular meetings, an open agenda where topics of discussion can be pinned in advance, and documentation artifacts would be built with time driven by consensus.In the second part of the context, several links are provided to various discussions, proposals and papers related to Bitcoin development. These include congestion-controlled transactions, advanced contracts, Taproot protocol, spacechains, mempool optimization, and smart contract-based transaction withholding. These discussions provide insights into the ongoing efforts to improve Bitcoin's scalability, privacy, and functionality. The links to these resources can be useful for anyone interested in understanding the current state and future direction of Bitcoin development.</p>
