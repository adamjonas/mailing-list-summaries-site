    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ruben thanks David for his suggestion to improve the protocol and increase its practicality. He also agrees that there is overlap with BIP78. However, from the recipient's perspective, there may be a potential privacy reduction when a placeholder transaction goes through. Ruben suggests marking these transactions in the wallet to notify the recipient. David proposes an alternative mitigation that requires the sender to reveal their intended transaction to the server before receiving the address. This would essentially look like an incomplete but signed transaction where the output address is still missing. David suggests maintaining a guaranteed unique address instead of a database of blocked inputs or mapped addresses. The spender submits a valid transaction paying a placeholder address and receives a guaranteed unique address, which they can use to broadcast their transaction. If the server doesn't see the transaction within a reasonable amount of time, it broadcasts the transaction paying the placeholder address. This approach is similar to the BIP78 payjoin protocol without any payjoining. BTCPay already implements BIP78, and several wallets do as well.</p>
