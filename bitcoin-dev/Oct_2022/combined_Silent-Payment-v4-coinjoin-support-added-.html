        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The latest update to Silent Payment, version 4, brings several important changes and improvements. One of the key enhancements is the use of all inputs to create transactions, which not only increases privacy but also makes it compatible with coinjoin. The `getspaddress` RPC command has been renamed to `getsilentaddress` for better clarity.Another significant addition is the support for silent payment in PSBT through the `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC. This allows for a more seamless integration of silent payments into the Bitcoin network.Furthermore, a new index scheme has been introduced, storing the sum of input public keys for each transaction. As a result, the previous index `bitcoin/signet/indexes/silentpaymentindex` has become incompatible with this new version and has been removed.Silent payments now rely solely on publicly available transaction data on the blockchain, eliminating the vulnerability to rogue-key attacks that can be present in multi-party schemes.However, the implementation of the new scheme encountered an issue due to the lack of support for x-only public key sum by `bitcoin-core/secp256k1`, possibly because of a missing prefix byte. To address this, a pull request (#1143) has been opened to introduce a function that converts x-only public keys to compressed public keys with even y.The tutorial has also been updated to reflect these changes, ensuring users have access to accurate and up-to-date information on how to utilize the new features and improvements.In summary, Silent Payment v4 introduces comprehensive improvements to enhance privacy, compatibility with coinjoin, and overall functionality. Users are encouraged to update to this latest version to leverage these advancements and enjoy a more secure and efficient silent payment experience.</p>
