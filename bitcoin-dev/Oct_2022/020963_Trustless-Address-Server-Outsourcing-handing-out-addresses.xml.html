    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Ruben and Peter on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, they discussed several topics related to Bitcoin addresses. Ruben suggested that handing out xpubs could lower the gap limit for generated addresses because there is less of a reason to expect a gap if those addresses are used by the same person. He also provided a link to a related thread. Peter added some points for discussion, including how handing out xpubs can make the gap limit problem quadratic, and questioned whether there could be an exotic deterministic path that doesn't split receive and change addresses. He also proposed adding invoice functionality to wallets that manage issuing fresh addresses even without them being used and have a configurable gap limit. Additionally, he suggested embedding a sunset date in the address format to allow an expiry for layer 1 addresses, similar to PGP keys.</p>
