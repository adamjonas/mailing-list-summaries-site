    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, relay of full-rbf (replace-by-fee) transactions was discussed. One member claimed that it works well already, except for a few percent of hashrate that will accept fullrbf replacement transactions. However, another member disagreed and stated that the missing piece is important and necessary for all full node users to try fullrbf. The first member responded by explaining that relay of full-rbf transactions works well currently due to the existence of a few implementations of preferential rbf peering. They are personally running four nodes with it enabled and have not seen many non-opt-in doublespends get mined. However, they have seen a few via their Alice OTS calendar. This may increase dramatically as miners turn on full-rbf.</p>
