    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, developers discussed the value of posting development ideas to the list vs. using a Github repository and the BIP process. While one developer argued that the public process and community standards development are important, another suggested that there is no central authority enforcing some particular way of doing things. They also talked about how Bitcoin Core developers consider it to be the protocol documentation and their internal process is the process of arriving at community consensus. The discussion touched on the topic of protocol versioning, with a proposal to update it being made and an invitation given to anyone interested in collaborating on it. Finally, one developer was accused of exhibiting arrogance when discussing their proposals.</p>
