        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ruben and Peter discussed various topics related to Bitcoin addresses. Ruben suggested that distributing xpubs could potentially reduce the gap limit for generated addresses since there would be less reason to expect a gap if those addresses are used by the same person. He shared a link to a related thread for further reference.Peter contributed to the discussion by highlighting some points worth considering. He mentioned that handing out xpubs can create a quadratic gap limit problem, where wallets need to scan multiple xpubs and their receive addresses. However, in the Lightning network, this issue can be avoided by utilizing Lightning addresses that employ plus addresses. This alternative approach proves to be effective in addressing the problem.Another topic of discussion was the need for an expiry date on layer 1 addresses to ensure that the receiver still possesses the corresponding keys. Peter pointed out that the Lightning network offers a solution to this concern as well.Furthermore, the conversation delved into the possibility of using a deterministic path that doesn't separate receive and change addresses. Satoshi's original wallet concept proposed an ever-growing key pool with a 100 address gap, which may serve as a potential solution to the gap limit problem.As the discussion continued, the idea of incorporating invoice functionality into wallets arose. This feature would allow wallets to issue fresh addresses even if they haven't been used, while also providing a configurable gap limit. Additionally, embedding a sunset date in the address format, similar to PGP keys, was suggested as a means to enable address expiry for layer 1 addresses.Overall, these discussions surrounding xpubs, invoice functionality, and address expiration are crucial considerations for businesses and individuals engaged in Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning network presents viable solutions to some of these concerns, and concepts such as an ever-growing key pool and configurable gap limits show promise in addressing the gap limit problem.</p>
