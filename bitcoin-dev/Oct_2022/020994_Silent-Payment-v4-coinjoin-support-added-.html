    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Silent Payment v4 has been released and it includes some important changes. Firstly, silent payments now use all inputs to create transactions which increases privacy and makes it compatible with coinjoin. The `getspaddress` RPC has been renamed to `getsilentaddress` for clarity. Additionally, support for silent payment in PSBT has been added via `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC. A new index scheme has also been included which stores the sum of input public keys for each transaction.The new version uses a different scheme for silent payments which is described on Github. However, as inputs can be Taproot, this introduced a new issue as `bitcoin-core/secp256k1` does not support x-only public key sum (perhaps due to missing prefix byte). To resolve this issue, a new PR (#1143) has been opened to add a function to convert from x-only to compressed public key with even y. This is the solution being used by the current silent payment implementation. Finally, the tutorial has been updated accordingly and the link is provided for reference. These changes are expected to enhance privacy and compatibility with coinjoin. It is recommended that users update to Silent Payment v4 to take advantage of these improvements.</p>
