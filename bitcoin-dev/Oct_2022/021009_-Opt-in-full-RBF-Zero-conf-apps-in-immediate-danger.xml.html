    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitrefill, a platform that supports on-chain payments for gift cards and phone top-ups, could encourage lightning payments as a win-win situation for the platform and its users. Currently, Bitrefill has a drop-down option for on-chain transactions where users select their wallet and are shown a tutorial on how to create the transaction. Bitcoin ATMs, which allow users to sell bitcoin for cash, could also benefit from showing lightning transfers more prominently. With full-RBF, wallets should educate users that unconfirmed transactions are unsafe. Muun is currently working to transition from zero-conf submarine swaps to payment channels, but they are still several months away from being production ready.</p>
