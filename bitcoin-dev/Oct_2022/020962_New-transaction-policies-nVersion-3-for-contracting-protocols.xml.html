    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers have been discussing proposals to improve v3 transactions. The changes include limiting the number of OP_TRUE outputs per transaction, adding an "ephemeral output" to pay CPFP fees without making the parent tx have fees itself, and allowing outputs that are below dust. They also discussed the need for new logic to handle package RBF, which is ParentTx*s*(plural) and ChildTx(singular). A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes to limit the pinning counterparty to attach a high fee to a child due to the limited size. Bitcoin Core developer Gloria Zhao has proposed a set of mempool and transaction relay policies to aid Layer 2/contract protocols. These involve additional rules for V3 transactions, such as only allowing one descendant per transaction to prevent pinning attacks. There are concerns that LN transactions could be fingerprinted based on nVersion. Finally, the Bitcoin development team has proposed modifications to the Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policy that will affect the way transactions are replaced and incentivized for mining.</p>
