    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange between members of the Bitcoin development community, concerns were raised about the use of zeroconf transactions and opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policies. While some businesses claim that zeroconf transactions work great for them, it was noted that this is achieved through sybil attacks on the network to measure propagation, which is not sustainable nor decentralized. The end result of this practice is not good for Bitcoin as it uses up inbound slots. Opt-in RBF policies were also discussed as potentially vulnerable to systematic exploitation by bad actors. However, it was suggested that once this starts being abused systemically, something else may need to be done with RBF payments, such as crediting the amount in BTC to a custodial account. It was noted that this option isn't available to normal payment processor type businesses. Overall, the discussion centered around ensuring the sustainability and decentralization of Bitcoin practices.</p>
