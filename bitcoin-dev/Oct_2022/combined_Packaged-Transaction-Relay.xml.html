        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the propagation of incentive-compatible transactions, with a proposed change to the Bitcoin protocol involving packaging transactions together based on feerate and sending them as a set to peers. The proposal includes additional constraints for packaged transactions to ensure they can be mined into one block and minimally satisfy peer.feerate.There is also discussion about the role of courtesy in public standards development and the use of BIPs. Some participants express concern that protocol cannot be defined on an ad-hoc basis as a "courtesy," but others argue that BIPs are a courtesy in the first place and that there is no central authority to enforce some particular way of doing things. The conversation highlights the challenges and benefits of public standards development in the Bitcoin community. Other topics discussed include bandwidth waste, packaged transaction relay processes, package validation and transaction relay rules, and the Package Relay Proposal for Bitcoin.Suggestions were made to address potential issues, such as using compact blocks to announce validated sets of transactions within a package, relying on the existing feefilter message in BIP133 to address potential dishonesty, and encoding parent txs as short hashes of wtxid to dedupe parents while avoiding round trips.Overall, the conversation aims to simplify the Package Relay Proposal and prevent unnecessary complexity while ensuring a live transaction relay network.</p>
