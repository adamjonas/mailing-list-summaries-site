        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers are proposing a new approach to testing and deploying soft forks on the Bitcoin network. The current process is seen as inefficient as it involves coming up with an idea, socializing it within the technical community, proposing a concrete idea, and getting rough consensus. However, this has not been effective in achieving broader-consensus due to the lack of champions following these steps.To address this issue, developers are suggesting that proposed changes be tested on the Segnet or Signet testnets before being deployed on the mainnet. Signet was created to address the unreliability and weaknesses of the testnet. Anthony Towns, among others, suggests that evaluations should consider whether a proposal is superior to any alternative ideas and if real, functioning examples of useful applications can be built with it. The performance impact on validators/miners should also be considered, as well as worst-case scenarios under normal conditions and when miners are attacking. Prototypes and testing on signet can help identify potential issues and ensure all details have been considered. AJ Towns proposes implementing a fork of core called "bitcoin-inquisition" to evaluate consensus changes like CTV, APO, TLUV, OP_CAT, among others. The proposed fork would enable developers to iterate through changes needed to consensus via bitcoin-inquisition client apps while testing them in public on signet, with pre-existing infrastructure available. Developers can mitigate the risk of a stalling blockchain or bugs interfering with testing by quickly noticing such bugs and reorging blocks that trigger them out. The goal is to improve the evaluation phase of soft fork proposals by using signet to see how they work in a production-like environment and to use the knowledge gained from this process to provide real answers to whether a proposal is sensible to deploy on mainnet.</p>
