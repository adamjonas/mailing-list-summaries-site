    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dario from Muun wallet has expressed concerns about the opt-in full-RBF deployment in Bitcoin Core nodes and how it would impact zero-conf apps. In response, Antoine explains that the deprecation of opt-in RBF over the entire network is to address a low-cost and straightforward DoS vector affecting the funding phase of multi-party contracting protocols.Antoine proposes several options for deployment, including introducing temporary `NODE_FULL_RBF` service bit and automated preferential peering, and opting for an opt-in full-rbf deployment. He also mentions two new approaches proposed, which include turning on by default `mempoolsetting` and making full-rbf by default at a flag day target, 1st May 2023. A third option is to withdraw `mempoolfullrbf` setting for 0.24, now withdrawn by its author.Dario raises concerns about how zero-conf apps break with opt-in full-RBF and how they are not protected with an opt-in deployment. Antoine explains that an application cannot control whether a replacement to an incoming transaction is relayed via full-RBF and how untrusted parties can easily cancel any unconfirmed transaction. Furthermore, he explains how other things need fixing before deployment, such as the mental model for unconfirmed incoming transactions and block explorers as payment receipts.Antoine also discusses the impact on Muun wallet, where they would have to turn off outgoing lightning payments for +100k monthly active users, which is a good chunk of all users making non-custodial lightning payments today.The message posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list underscores that subtle fixes in a product can have significant impacts that cannot be deployed before affecting users. The author notes that while they cannot speak for other applications, many are impacted by changes that users may not be aware of. The post serves as a reminder to consider the potential consequences of updates and changes before implementing them.</p>
