    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns via bitcoin-dev has predicted that with the full RBF release and support from Murch and others, full RBF will be usable on mainnet within two or three months. However, it may still require special effort to actually find a peer that can relay full RBF transactions to that hashpower, despite the privacy implications. Anthony is not confident that this would mean people would actively steal from zeroconf businesses in any volume. He is not aware of any zeroconf accepting businesses where exploiting double spends can be done without significant legal risk. Bitrefill has significant legal risk, and ATMs have less risk. However, he hasn't seen an ATM that accepts BTC without a confirmation in many years. Furthermore, he hasn't found a non-KYC/AML in-person currency exchange service that would accept funds without a confirmation, and all the anonymous crypto-exchange websites like FixedFloat require a confirmation. He found AML/KYC in-person currency exchange services that would accept zero conf. But of course, they had sufficient details on him to just call the police if he double-spent them. In practice, there are very few people who are actually affected by zeroconf going away.</p>
