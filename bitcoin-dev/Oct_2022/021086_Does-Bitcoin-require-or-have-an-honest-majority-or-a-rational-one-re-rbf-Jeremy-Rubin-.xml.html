    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, John Carvalho suggested that responsible 0-conf acceptance is rational and trusting, while RBF enforcement is irrational and trusting. However, Peter Todd countered that his OpenTimestamps calendars use RBF for optimal fee discovery, with replacements accounting for about 95% of OTS transactions mined. He found that at least 97.21% of hashing power supports opt-in RBF, and questioned whether almost all hashing power is therefore irrational. Todd also pointed out that Electrum has an undo button implemented with RBF, which he has used successfully. Finally, he noted that rejecting blocks containing double-spends could lead to severe consensus problems, despite the fact that it should be implemented.</p>
