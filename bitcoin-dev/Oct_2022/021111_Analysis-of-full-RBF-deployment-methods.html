    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Antoine Riard and Dario Sneidermanis discuss the potential risks and benefits of a full-replace-by-fee (RBF) deployment on the Bitcoin network. While Antoine is concerned about the potential disruptions to contracting protocols and multi-party applications, Dario argues that a reliable full-RBF network is necessary to prevent pinning denial-of-service attacks. Dario suggests that option 5 in the original post (#26323) would be the best approach to achieve a reliable full-RBF network while not threatening zero-conf applications until the activation time. Antoine agrees with this approach but suggests that May 1st, 2023, could be too early for full-RBF deployment, and 10-12 months sounds more reasonable. Antoine also highlights the need for more communication channels between business/service operators and protocol developers to better clarify functional responsibilities between protocol and application layers. However, he does not believe that it should be the responsibility of developers to solve every operational risk encumbered by a Bitcoin business. Dario counters this argument, stating that asking for a predictable deployment timeline for a change that would put some applications at increased risk should not be described as burdening the developers with solving every operational risk. The goal of the deployment method comparison was to soften the burden on core devs.</p>
