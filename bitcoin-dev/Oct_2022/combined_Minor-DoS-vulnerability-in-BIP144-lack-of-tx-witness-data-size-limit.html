        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On October 11, 2022, Loki Verloren brought attention to a problem with BIP144 regarding a recent multisig segwit transaction. The issue arises from the fact that a single transaction witness can be as large as the maximum block size. This has resulted in a special case where a block contains over 33k worth of witness data. To address this, it is crucial to establish a specific limit on the size of a transaction witness and engage in a broader discussion about total transaction sizes.Implementing arbitrary size restrictions within the consensus may have negative consequences such as burned coins, adding complexity without any real gain. Therefore, it is essential to devise a proper specification for setting the maximum size limit of a transaction witness. Failure to do so would render proper implementation impossible, leaving the bitcoin core repository code as the only available option.Loki Verloren suggests that the weight calculation should increase exponentially to discourage the inclusion of transactions like the aforementioned one on the blockchain. The cost of executing such a transaction was approximately $5. While there are various issues associated with adding arbitrary size restrictions to the consensus, the primary focus must be on addressing the problem with BIP144 and establishing a concrete limit on the maximum size of a transaction witness.</p>
