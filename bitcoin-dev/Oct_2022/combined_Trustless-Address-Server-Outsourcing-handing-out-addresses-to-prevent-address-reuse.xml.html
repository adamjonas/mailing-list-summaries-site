        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A protocol for non-interactive distribution of bitcoin addresses that outsources interaction to third-party servers has been discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The sender interacts with the server, which represents the recipient and hands out an address from an xpub. This protocol is useful for light clients who want to receive payments without interacting. Address authentication is another use case for this setup, where an address server picks an unused address, signs it, and sends a signed blob back to the sender containing an address and a signature proving its legitimacy.Concerns were raised in the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussions about the accuracy of addresses and public keys before sending any funds. Members discuss concerns about clipboard hijacking and copy-pasting public keys. Wallet's "public key" is only used to authenticate addresses and never leaves the wallet. Ruben Somsen proposed a method for recipients to sign their public keys as a form of authentication, but Bryan Bishop pointed out that it is still necessary to ensure the public key itself is securely communicated. In response to Ruben's proposal, Bryan questioned if copy-pasting pubkeys instead of an address would pose the same problem.Regarding transaction replay attacks, Dave proposed a method where the spender submits to the server a valid transaction paying a placeholder address and receives a guaranteed unique address in return. If the server doesn't see that transaction within a reasonable amount of time, it should broadcast the transaction paying the placeholder address. This is essentially the BIP78 payjoin protocol without any payjoining going on.An alternative mitigation to prevent transaction replay attacks was suggested, requiring the sender to reveal their intended transaction to the server before receiving the address. If the transaction doesn't end up getting sent, any subsequent attempt to reuse one of the inputs should either be blacklisted or responded to with the same address that was given out earlier.A developer is working on a light wallet and has come up with an idea to provide an endpoint that can vend fresh receive addresses to senders. They have suggested another use case for this setup: address authentication. The wallet has an address book with a pubkey for each recipient the user wants to send Bitcoin to. When Alice wants to pay Bob, she clicks "Bob" in her transaction UI, and her wallet goes and asks the address server for an address for Bob.Ruben Somsen proposed an alternative mitigation to prevent transaction replay attacks. He suggested requiring the sender to reveal their intended transaction to the server prior to receiving the address. In response, Dave proposed an alternative method. This approach is similar to the BIP78 payjoin protocol without any payjoining. BTCPay already implements BIP78, and several wallets do as well.Ruben thanks David for his suggestion to improve the protocol and increase its practicality. He also agrees that there is overlap with BIP78. However, from the recipient's perspective, there may be a potential privacy reduction when a placeholder transaction goes through. Ruben suggests marking these transactions in the wallet to notify the recipient.</p>
