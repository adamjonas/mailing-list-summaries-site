    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is thanking the recipient for their work on silent payments and improvements made in each version. The latest version, Silent Payment v4, adds coinjoin support, increases privacy by using all inputs to create transactions (previously only the first input was used), and renames the `getspaddress` RPC to `getsilentaddress` for clarity. Additionally, support for silent payment in PSBT via the `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPC has been added, and a new index scheme has been introduced which stores the sum of input public keys for each transaction. Silent payments now use the scheme `hash(i1*X + i2*X + i3*X + ...)*G + X == hash(x*(I1+I2+I3+...))*G + X`, as described in a link provided in the message. As inputs can be Taproot, this introduced a new issue as `bitcoin-core/secp256k1` does not support x-only public key sum (perhaps due to missing prefix byte). A new PR (#1143) has been opened to add a function to convert from x-only to compressed public key with even y. Finally, the tutorial has been updated and a warning has been mentioned in the output for `getsilentaddress` RPC when used with a label. The message was sent with Proton Mail secure email.</p>
