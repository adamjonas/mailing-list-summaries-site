    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on October 20, 2022, Greg Sanders expressed concerns about a proposal that would restrict broadcasting of data packets larger than 64 bytes. He worried that people might find it odd that the limit was set at 64 bytes and not the previously proposed 61, 62, or 63 bytes. Despite this concern, he was willing to modify his proposal and pull request if there were no strong objections. Peter Todd responded by stating that it was okay to restrict only 64 bytes as there was a specific reason for doing so, and only fairly technical use-cases would be affected. The email thread included a non-text attachment with Peter Todd's signature.</p>
