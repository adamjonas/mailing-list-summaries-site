    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, John Carvalho expressed his concern about the advancement of Replace-By-Fee (RBF) while merchants are not allowed to manage their own zero-confirmation (0conf) risk. However, Peter Todd, a Bitcoin expert, explained that managing 0conf risk by connecting to a large number of nodes is considered an attack and can be harmful to Bitcoin. Todd added that in the past, some merchants have even tried to make deals with miners directly and suggested reorging out double-spends, which is obviously very harmful. Therefore, allowing only a few merchants to risk-manage propagation is centralized and unfair.</p>
