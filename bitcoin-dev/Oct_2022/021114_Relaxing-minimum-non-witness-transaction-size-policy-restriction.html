    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A competing pull request has been opened for separate evaluation in response to feedback. Greg Sanders initially opened an issue regarding the broadcast of blocks that are 61, 62, or 63 bytes long but not 64 bytes. He wanted to ensure the proposal did not die in case people found it odd. However, Peter Todd commented that it is okay to only restrict blocks that are 64 bytes long since there is a specific reason for doing so. It is also noted that this change is not a consensus change like the Great Consensus Cleanup, and only fairly technical use cases would be affected. Feedback is requested on the new pull request.</p>
