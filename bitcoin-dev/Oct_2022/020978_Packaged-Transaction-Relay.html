    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Eric Voskuil pointed out that protocol cannot be defined on an ad-hoc basis as a "courtesy", in reference to a comment regarding version restrictions on BIPs. However, there is no central authority to enforce any particular way of doing things with regards to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), which are essentially a courtesy to the community. Voskuil questioned why such a comment would be accepted instead of being specified properly within the BIP.If anyone believes that the version restriction should be part of the BIP, they can submit a pull request as it is still marked as "Draft". It was noted that nobody who has worked with it is particularly fond of Bitcoin's P2P protocol versioning, however, a proposal to update it has been worked on by some members of the community. Collaborators are welcome and can contact the author directly if interested in contributing.The proposed solution for updating the protocol versioning can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202210-p2pfeatures/bip-p2pfeatures.mediawiki">https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202210-p2pfeatures/bip-p2pfeatures.mediawiki</a>. Overall, the discussion highlights the decentralized nature of the bitcoin community and the importance of collaboration and transparency in making improvements to the protocol.</p>
