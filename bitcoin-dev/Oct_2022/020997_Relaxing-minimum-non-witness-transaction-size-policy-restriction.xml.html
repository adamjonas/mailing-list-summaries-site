    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 11, 2022, Greg Sanders proposed relaxing the minimum non-witness transaction size policy restriction from 85 to 65 non-witness bytes. This change was motivated by the need to support more exotic transaction types and to address a covert fix for CVE-2017-12842. The proposed change would allow for a single input, single output transaction with 4 bytes of OP_RETURN padding instead of having to pad out 21 bytes to get to p2wpkh size. However, there is also consideration being given to allowing anything below 64 non-witness bytes. KING JAMES HRMH raised concerns about backward compatibility for older clients like v0.18 and how they may not be able to receive transactions from newer clients that require validation of 85 non-witness serialized bytes. The PR for this proposed change can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26265">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26265</a>. Until this change reaches a critical mass of 10%+ of the network, propagation of these types of transactions may be hampered.</p>
