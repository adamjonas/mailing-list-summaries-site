        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gloria Zhao has proposed a set of mempool/transaction relay policies aimed at aiding L2/contract protocols. The proposal includes additional policy rules applying to V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules. The main goal is to improve the security model for layer-two (L2) contracts. Under the proposal, commitment transactions should be V3 and have one anchor output. This allows for replaceability through child-pays-for-parent (CPFP), meaning that only the commitment transaction and up to 1000 virtual bytes (vB) need to be replaced, rather than the entire channel state.The proposal also introduces other changes, such as allowing a single dust-value output that is immediately spent by the package, making anchors easier to design. Batched fee-bumping of time-sensitive confirmations of commitment transactions is considered unsafe.The proposal includes discussions on other potential improvements, such as making OP_TRUE a standard script type and allowing outputs below dust. However, these changes are not considered standard until they are allowed.There are concerns about the impact on the UTXO set and the chance of the 0 sat output entering the UTXO set, but it is believed that this should not happen often in practice.The proposal also addresses expected questions from the community, providing clarifications on issues such as Rule 3 pinning, counterparty commitment transactions, privacy concerns, backward compatibility, and the replaceability of V2 and V3 transactions.Links to the original proposal and related discussions are provided, and feedback and review of the proposal are welcomed. Overall, the proposal is seen as valuable work for L2 contracts and could greatly improve their security model.Bitcoin developer Gloria Zhao has proposed a new version of transaction format, V3, aimed at improving replace-by-fee (RBF) and child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) protocols. The proposal includes four rules that specify limits on the size and number of "descendant" transactions, or those that rely on an unconfirmed parent transaction for funding. One of the key changes is that a V3 transaction cannot change based on what transactions are mined, which simplifies subsequent rules about descendant limits much easier to check. Unconfirmed V3 transactions cannot have more than one descendant. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes. Commitment transactions should also be V3 and have one anchor output.The proposal aims to prevent pinning attacks where a malicious counterparty prevents a transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping. The smaller the descendant size limit, the fewer UTXOs a child may use to fund this fee-bump. However, as the fee-bumping child only needs to fund fees, just a few UTXOs should suffice. With a limit of 1000 virtual bytes, depending on the output types, the child can have 6-15 UTXOs, which should be enough to fund a fee-bump without requiring a carefully-managed UTXO pool.Package RBF modifications have also been suggested. One of the main changes is that all package transactions with mempool conflicts are required to be V3. This also means the "sponsoring" child transaction must be V3. The proposals are intended for usage in Layer 2 Bitcoin transactions, such as commitment transactions on the Lightning Network.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed a new set of mempool/transaction relay policies to aid L2/contract protocols. The proposal aims to improve the security model of L2 contracts and enhance the composability of smart contracting. It includes a package RBF logic, which will replace the parent transaction with a child that's high-fee, making the original tx stuck in the mempool. The proposal also suggests using fingerprinting and an anchor output to detect unilateral closures and allow fee-bumping without publishing one's commitment.Moreover, the proposal recommends a few modifications to the existing policy rules, such as increasing the upper bound of the V3 transaction size to accommodate large UTXOs, allowing OP_TRUE as a standard script type, and adding a 0-value output to make anchors easier to design. However, some concerns have been raised about compatibility with miner incentives and potential utxo set bloat issues.In a recent IRC discussion, a proposal was made to address concerns about unconfirmed v3 transactions with ephemeral outputs. The proposed design ensures that any child v3 transaction spending the unconfirmed parent spends the ephemeral output(s) and requires a child to CPFP for transactions that pay no fees. Ruben Somsen expressed interest in allowing transactions to be 0 fees and have a 0 sat output that could be used to pay all the fees with CPFP. The proposal presented is intended for fee-bumping presigned transactions specifically using CPFP and anchor outputs and is a minimally-invasive step that works for Lightning today, similar to CPFP carve-out.The proposal</p>
