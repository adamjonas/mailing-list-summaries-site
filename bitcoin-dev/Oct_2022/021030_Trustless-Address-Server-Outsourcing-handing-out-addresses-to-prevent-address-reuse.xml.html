    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member named rot13maxi raised concerns about clipboard hijacking. They explained that if someone copies a cryptocurrency address to their clipboard and then pastes it into their wallet to send funds, the clipboard contents could be replaced with an address controlled by a malicious actor. This would result in the user sending their funds to the wrong address without realizing it.Another member named Bryan responded, pointing out that this same problem could also occur when copy-pasting public keys from an address book into a wallet. The discussion highlights the importance of being cautious when sending cryptocurrency transactions and verifying the accuracy of addresses and public keys before sending any funds.</p>
