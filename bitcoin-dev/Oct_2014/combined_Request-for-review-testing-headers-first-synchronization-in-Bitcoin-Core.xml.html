        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has developed a new mode of operation called headers-first synchronization which changes the way the best chain is discovered, downloaded and verified. This mode offers several advantages over the traditional method of downloading blocks. These benefits include: parallel block downloading, no more stalled downloads, greater robustness against unresponsive or slow peers, fewer checkpoints in the code, reducing memory usage during sync and removing a class of DoS attacks related to peers feeding you low-difficulty valid large blocks on a side branch. The new mode of operation is a major step towards an SPV mode using the reference codebase. Historically, this mode of operation has been known for years by Greg Maxwell but it took a long time to refactor the code enough to support it. Technically, headers-first synchronization replaces the single-peer blocks download by a single-peer headers download (which typically takes seconds/minutes) and verification, and simultaneously fetching blocks along the best known headers chain from all peers that are known to have the relevant blocks. However, there are some known issues such as slow download speeds at the start of the sync, blocks being stored on disk out of order, and the block index database holding headers for which no block is stored on disk.The code for headers-first synchronization is available as a github pull request or packaged on <a href="http://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/headersfirst">http://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/headersfirst</a> where binaries can be found to test with. The protocol level increases the minimally supported version for peers to 31800 (corresponding to bitcoin v3.18, released in december 2010), as earlier versions did not support the getheaders P2P message. Lastly, benchmarking testing shows headers-first synchronization is much faster than traditional methods.</p>
