    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 1, 2014, Luke Dashjr suggested creating a GET-TXIN-BLOCK-(TIME/HEIGHT)-EQUALVERIFY operator in response to the question of how to have the stack item be incremented by the height at which the scriptPubKey was in a block. The proposed scriptPubKey would fail unless the top stack item is equal to the txin block height and then add the delta height, after which it would run CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Dashjr noted that encoding the target height/time directly would present limitations as miners may choose not to mine the first transaction until they can also take the "burn to fee." To avoid this, he suggested reproducing the generation maturity rule by saying "cannot be spent until 100 blocks after the first transaction is mined," and unlocking the sacrifices years into the future to exceed any reasonable business cycle.</p>
