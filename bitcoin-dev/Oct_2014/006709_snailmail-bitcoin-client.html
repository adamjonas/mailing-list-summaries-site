    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A potential business idea is to offer a service where customers can send bitcoin transactions printed on paper, which are then scanned and broadcasted to the network for a fee. The fee could be either a minimum amount or 0.01% of the transaction value, and could be sent as another paper transaction or in cash. As an expansion, the service could offer a snail mail-based email or publishing platform where customers send letters that are made available in various forms, such as a single webpage, via email, or in a data dump with all open letters received within a certain time frame.</p>
