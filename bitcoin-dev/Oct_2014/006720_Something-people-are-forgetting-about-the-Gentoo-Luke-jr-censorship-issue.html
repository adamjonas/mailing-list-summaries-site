    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core, a project that provides software for Bitcoin network, has faced issues with Linux distributions modifying their software while packaging it. Luke Dashjr, a contributor to Bitcoin Core, has made changes to the software to bring it closer to user expectations. However, similar issues are expected to arise in the future with other Linux distributions. Trademarking the project name and enforcing "clean" packaging is a solution that has been successful with projects like Firefox and Chrome. The goal is not to remove choice but to ensure users know what they are getting. Renaming a project and creating a package under the new name would be better for end-users and allow the fork to grow into something else, making it more usable for people on other distros. While Bitcoin is already a trademark, Bitcoin Core is not. The author intends to follow the same approach with Lighthouse, another project they are working on.</p>
