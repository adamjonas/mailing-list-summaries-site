    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on October 15, 2014 at 7:40 PM, Peter Todd and BTC Drak discussed the challenges of using Google lists for non-Google users. According to BTC Drak, Google lists are somewhat proprietary or Gmail lock-in focused making it difficult to subscribe with a non-Google address, especially if there is any hint that the address is associated with a Gmail account. Peter Todd recommended mailmanlist.net as an alternative which he had used to host a small mailman list without any issues. He noted that the service costs $5 per month for 1000 subscribers. Luke mentioned that he has been using nongnu.org for BFGMiner announce/dev mailing lists for some time, although he wasn't sure what software it runs. However, he added that they would need to go through Savannah's free software auditing which might be a good idea anyway.</p>
