    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Rebroad inquired on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about the implementation of an idea proposed in an article found at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145066.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145066.0</a>. The idea was said to be excellent, but it was not clear what was holding up its implementation. Rebroad asked if someone needed to code it or write a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) first. Another user, named Matt, responded that the idea was already a variation of one that had been discussed on the Bitcointalk forum before. Matt did not provide further information or links regarding this previous discussion. The email ended with an advertisement for EventLog Analyzer, a tool that helps achieve PCI DSS 3.0 compliance.</p>
