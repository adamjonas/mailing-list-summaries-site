    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context provided is a discussion thread where the author expresses their opinion that the proposal being discussed is a waste of time. The proposal suggests random changes for non-existing or not-yet-existing issues related to the subsidy schedule of Bitcoin. The author believes that there is more complexity to the system than just the subsidy schedule. The main question posed in the discussion is what makes Bitcoin secure, to which the answer is proofs of work produced by miners. Miners have economic incentives to play by the rules as it is more profitable than performing attacks. The discussion then moves on to questioning why and when it works and what the boundaries are.</p>
