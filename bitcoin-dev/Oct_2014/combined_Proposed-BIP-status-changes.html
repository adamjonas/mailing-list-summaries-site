        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In October 2014, a debate arose on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the discussion of changes to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Wladimir, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, argued that BIP changes should be discussed on the mailing list to ensure community consensus, as outlined in BIP1. This discussion highlighted the importance of community involvement and open dialogue in the development of cryptocurrency protocols. The adherence to established guidelines, such as BIP1, promotes transparency and collaboration within the community.The world of cryptocurrencies recognizes the significance of BIP changes, which necessitate community consensus. According to BIP1, discussions regarding these changes should be held on the mailing list to ensure alignment among participants. Consequently, holding BIP discussions through GitHub pull requests is deemed inappropriate. Wladimir's statement regarding the appropriate forum for BIP discussions serves as a guiding principle for the community, enabling informed decision-making regarding project direction.On October 15, 2014, Wladimir proposed that several BIPs be moved to the Final state, as they had already been implemented and fixed. These BIPs include BIP 14, BIP 21, BIP 22, BIP 31, BIP 34, BIP 35, and BIP 37. Luke questioned this suggestion, expressing curiosity as to why the discussion was not taking place through a GitHub pull request instead of cluttering the mailing list.Wladimir announced on October 15, 2014, that several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should be considered for their final state. These BIPs had already been implemented and fixed, requiring a new BIP amendment for any changes. The mentioned BIPs encompass various aspects, such as BIP Protocol Version and User Agent (BIP 14), URI Scheme (BIP 21), getblocktemplate - Fundamentals (BIP 22), Pong Message (BIP 31), Block v2, Height in coinbase (BIP 34), mempool message (BIP 35), and Bloom filtering (BIP 37). It is important to note that these BIPs have been widely implemented and are now considered fixed, necessitating future changes to be made through new BIP amendments. Wladimir sought feedback from the community on this announcement, confirming the successful implementation and standardization of these BIPs within the Bitcoin community.To summarize, the provided context revolves around the implementation and fixed status of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Any modifications to these BIPs would require a new amendment. The mentioned BIPs, including BIP 14, BIP 21, BIP 22, BIP 31, BIP 34, BIP 35, and BIP 37, have already been widely implemented and are now considered standard within the Bitcoin community. The author seeks community feedback on whether these BIPs should be categorized as final. It is crucial to acknowledge that any changes to these BIPs would necessitate new amendments.</p>
