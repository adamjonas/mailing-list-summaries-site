    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It is suggested that using SSL on Bluetooth connections would not be difficult to implement with Java. However, SSL is large, old and complicated, leading to a desire for simpler encryption methods. It is noted that there is no problem with the sender knowing the public key of the address included in the URI. Alternative PKIs are discussed in another thread, as there are currently no usable alternatives to the SSL PKI. The issue of HTTP base failure signal is mentioned, where BIP70 was originally designed so that clients would not broadcast transactions. If the merchant did not like the payment, they could simply return an error. Bitcoin Core, however, broadcasts transactions simultaneously, meaning receivers cannot reject payments. Regarding merge avoidance, it is suggested that users can specify the amounts they want to avoid merges in their own wallets, and the sending wallet could then pay with multiple transactions. There is discussion surrounding the trustworthiness of HTTPS and outsourcing payment processing, but it is believed that building a better replacement would be difficult. Finally, it is suggested that if a full fledged wifi connection were provided to customers, a sophisticated proxy server would need to be in place that can allow only access to bitcoin nodes. The dedicated blockchain radio is also discussed as a rare use case.</p>
