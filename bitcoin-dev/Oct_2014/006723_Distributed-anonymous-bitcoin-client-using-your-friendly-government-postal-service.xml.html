    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>To make a transaction with two outputs, the first output is for payee while the second one is for the fee to be given to the person who transmits the transaction to the network. The transaction should be signed and printed along with the private key controlling the address of output B. Afterward, it needs to be sent in the mail to one or more greedy people who are unknown to you.Regarding Namecoin, it allows mixing outputs for name registration with pay to hash outputs. This means that Namecoin can be used for anonymous publishing through posts. Additionally, if the transaction is a 40-byte tweet, output A can be made in Bitcoin scripted with op_return.In summary, making a transaction with two outputs requires providing a payee output and a fee output for the transaction transmitter. The transaction should be signed and printed together with the private key controlling the address of output B. After that, it must be sent to unknown greedy individuals. Namecoin allows for mixing outputs for name registration with pay to hash outputs, enabling anonymous publishing through posts. If the transaction is a 40-byte tweet, output A can be created in Bitcoin scripted with op_return.</p>
