    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation started with a proposal by Luke Dashjr to increment the stack item by the height at which scriptPubKey was in a block, which Peter Todd disagreed with. Instead, he suggested creating a GET-TXIN-BLOCK-(TIME/HEIGHT)-EQUALVERIFY operator and adding a CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which would fail unless the top stack item is equal to the txin block height. Todd also mentioned that sacrificing coins to unlock years into the future would thoroughly exceed any reasonable business cycle, although short maturity periods were appropriate for many use cases. There was some debate about incentivizing mining centralization with short maturities. Flavien Charlon asked if the proposal could be used to build a script that can only be spent up until block X. Overall, they discussed ways to implement arbitrary logic, including "output cannot be spent until a certain time," "output can ONLY be spent until a certain time," and complex logic with alternative key groups with differing time constraints.</p>
