    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 15, 2014, Wladimir announced that several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) should go to their final state. These BIPs had already been implemented and fixed in place, so any changes would require a new BIP as an amendment. The BIPs that were mentioned in the announcement include BIP 14 (BIP Protocol Version and User Agent), BIP 21 (URI Scheme), BIP 22 (getblocktemplate - Fundamentals), BIP 31 (Pong Message), BIP 34 (Block v2, Height in coinbase), BIP 35 (mempool message), and BIP 37 (Bloom filtering).It is important to note that these BIPs have been widely implemented and are now considered fixed. Any future changes will need to be made through new BIPs as amendments. The announcement was made on the Bitcoin-development mailing list and Wladimir asked for feedback from the community. Overall, the announcement serves as a confirmation that these BIPs have been successfully implemented and are now considered standard within the Bitcoin community.</p>
