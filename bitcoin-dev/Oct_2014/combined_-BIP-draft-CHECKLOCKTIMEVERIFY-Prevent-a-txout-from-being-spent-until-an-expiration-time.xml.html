        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation on October 9, 2014, Adam Back mentioned that the existing script level nlocktime could do everything in some sense with a complexity cost, which often requires extra dependent transactions and work-around malleability until it is fixed. Peter Todd asked if anyone could think of an example of a complex transaction use-case that is affected by malleability which cannot be fixed by CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. Matt Whitlock suggested that a new opcode replace the top stack item with the block height of the txout being redeemed, but this would not be soft-forking compatible and would be unsafe as it risks creating weird pressures around immediate block admission since a one additional block delay could forever censor such a transaction. Avoiding these issues is a conscious design in OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.</p>
