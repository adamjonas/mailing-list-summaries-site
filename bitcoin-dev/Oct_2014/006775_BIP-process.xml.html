    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin mailing list has a low amount of traffic despite the cryptocurrency's 10-billion-dollar market capitalization, according to a post by a new member. The poster remarked that code changes for bitcoin-core and other clients are likely discussed elsewhere. They added that more public discussion is needed and splitting the mailing list would not help. Another member agreed that more discussion is always good but suggested creating a way for people working on different aspects of Bitcoin to filter out topics they are not interested in. The poster believes having multiple mailing lists would not cause fragmentation.</p>
