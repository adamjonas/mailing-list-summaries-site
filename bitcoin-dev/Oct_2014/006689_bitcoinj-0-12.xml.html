    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 3, 2014, Mike Hearn announced the release of version 0.12 of bitcoinj, a popular Bitcoin library used by multiple wallets and other Bitcoin-related projects. This release includes several notable enhancements such as hierarchical and deterministic (HD) wallets, support for multisig wallets, faster ECDSA, an integrated Tor mode, and many API improvements. Other improvements include upgrades to the included GUI wallet which can be seen in a new screencasted tutorial, and more example apps showing how to use parts of the API. Additionally, there are many other bugfixes, cleanups, minor tweaks, and small new APIs. The documentation has been significantly extended to cover encryption, watching wallets, HD wallets, and multisig/married wallets. A new document and accompanying screencast shows how to extend the WalletTemplate app to have a transactions list, and then make a native/bundled package that doesnâ€™t need the user to install Java. The API changes include a change in the package name to org.bitcoinj and updates to some method names. Kristov Atlas asked if there were any plans for bitcoinj to support stealth address sending and/or receiving.</p>
