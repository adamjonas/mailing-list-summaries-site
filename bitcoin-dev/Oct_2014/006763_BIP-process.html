    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Zander, a technical adviser for both the OSI (NEN) and the OASIS standards committees, suggests using a process similar to that of these committees for managing BIPs. He proposes that one person should own a BIP and put it forward when it is mature enough. During the phase where random people propose changes, all changes should go in a public mailing list, and they can be accepted by the owner without discussion. If anyone has an objection to the change, they speak up and follow group consensus until consensus is reached. At some point, the BIP is mature enough to vote on at the discretion of the owner, who then requests a vote. If the above process was handled cleanly there is a very small chance of it being down-voted so an actual vote may not be needed. A deadline is necessary, and afterward, the proposal is marked final or closed as "needs more work."</p>
