    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core developers are planning to release version 0.10 of the software by January 2015. A branch split-off and feature freeze is planned for November 18, with a Release Candidate cycle starting on December 1. The final release date will depend on how long it takes to resolve any critical issues found during the RC cycle. In order to meet this deadline, major developments that have already been proposed, such as BIP62 and the verification library, need to be merged before November 18. Other potential features that may make it into the release include Gitian descriptors overhaul, "autoprune," an "RPC warmup mode," and an unauthenticated HTTP REST interface. The delay in the release of version 0.10 was due to the inclusion of headers-first, which took longer than expected. There is now discussion about switching to a fixed six-month major release schedule, with versions 0.11.0, 0.12.0, and 0.13.0 tentatively scheduled for July 2015, January 2016, and July 2016 respectively. Developers can help with the development process by testing and reviewing pull requests, as well as reporting bugs and regressions.</p>
