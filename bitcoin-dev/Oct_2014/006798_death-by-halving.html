    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The recent halving event didn't have a significant impact on the market, but it might be different next time. In a rapidly growing market, high margins are possible due to limited investment and efficient technology. However, as the market matures, lower margins are expected. The halving can cause more damage when margins are small. Additionally, the ecosystem has matured since 2012, with miners now primarily motivated by profit rather than securing the network. Multipools also didn't exist in 2012, which automatically switches between mining alt-chains to maximize profits. This could potentially allow someone to buy enough hashpower to attack Bitcoin if the halving results in a significant hashrate drop.</p>
