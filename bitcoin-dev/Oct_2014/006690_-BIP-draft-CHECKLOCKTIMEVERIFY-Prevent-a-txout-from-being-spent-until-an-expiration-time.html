    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the ability to detect upgrades in soft and hard forks. The statement that detecting an upgrade is easier with a soft-fork was made, suggesting that by looking at the block header nVersion numbers and warning users if they increase beyond what is valid, detection can be done. It was also mentioned that older clients should not be presented with data they would refuse to accept to ensure they don't accept new version blocks. It was clarified that nobody said hard forks shouldn't have an associated block version number increase. However, the difference lies in whether older clients are presented with data they would refuse to accept, resulting in them not accepting new version blocks. In terms of detecting upgrades, new version numbers result in only a log print while being hard forked off results in both log prints and the -alertnotify being run.The author requests that implications that this topic is settled should stop and the notion that all nodes are fully validating when they are not should be addressed instead.</p>
