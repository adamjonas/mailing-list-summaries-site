    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email, a user named Q has asked for clarification regarding transaction fee changes and txconfirmtarget described at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c8a25189bcb1381eddf46b9a9743ba48e929439e/doc/release-notes.md (for Core 0.10). The user also asks whether this includes the floating fees for 0.10 as described at bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/floating-fees-for-0-10/. Wladimir responds to this by proposing a timeline for the release of 0.10. He proposes splitting off a 0.10 branch on November 18th, releasing 10.0rc1 on December 1st and starting the Release Candidate cycle. The RC cycle will run until no critical problems are found.Wladimir mentions that he intended the 0.10 release to be much sooner but insisted on including headers-first which took longer than expected. He also talks about a preference to switch to a fixed 6-month major release schedule, beginning with July 2015: 0.11.0 (or whatever N+1 release is called), January 2016: 0.12.0 (or whatever N+2 release is called) and July 2016: 0.13.0 (or whatever N+3 release is called).Wladimir further notes that any pending development for 0.10 should be merged before November 18th. Major work that he is aware of includes BIP62 (#5134, #5065), Verification library (#5086, #5118, #5119), Gitian descriptors overhaul, so that Gitian depends = Travis depends (#4727), Autoprune (#4701), Add "warmup mode" for RPC server (#5007), and Add unauthenticated HTTP REST interface (#2844). Wladimir encourages users to help along the development process by participating in testing and reviewing of the mentioned pull requests, or just by testing master and reporting bugs and regressions. The email ends with links to <a href="http://abis.io,">http://abis.io,</a> which is a "protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good", and <a href="https://keybase.io/odinn">https://keybase.io/odinn</a>.</p>
