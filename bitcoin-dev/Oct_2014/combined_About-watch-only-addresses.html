        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In response to Flavien's inquiry, Wladimir confirms that watch-only addresses have been merged into Bitcoin Core and can be accessed through the "importaddress" RPC call. However, he advises caution when using the master version without development/debugging experience and recommends building it yourself if you want to test day-to-day development versions. He also mentions that there are currently no nightly builds available.Warren Togami Jr., a Bitcoin developer, shares his own branch of Bitcoin 0.9.3 which includes watch-only functionality and patches to clean it up from the master branch. Although it has not been heavily tested, it seems to work fine. Sipa's address index branch may be more suitable for cases where information about any address is required, and jmcorgan continues to maintain an up-to-date version. DexX7 also has his own branch for balance queries with additional RPC calls, but he recommends reviewing the changes before considering using it.Overall, watch-only addresses have been integrated into Bitcoin Core, but users are advised to exercise caution when using the master version without development/debugging experience. Warren Togami Jr. has created a branch with watch-only functionality and several patches, and there are alternative branches available for specific use cases. The release candidate for version 0.10 is expected in a few months, possibly by the end of the year. At present, there are no nightly builds available, as Warren stopped building them around June.</p>
