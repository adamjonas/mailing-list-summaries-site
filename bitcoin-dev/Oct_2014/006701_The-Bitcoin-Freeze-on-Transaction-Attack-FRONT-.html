    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses an ORBS attack or an attempt to form an ad-hoc coalition for a fork. The preparation step includes adding a transaction between two of own addresses in every block, which miners can do at zero cost in their own blocks. The execution involves embedding a transaction double spending the regular transaction with one that offers a high fee into the preferred fork, offering an incentive for rational miners to join the ad-hoc coalition for that fork. Anyone can attempt to form an ad-hoc coalition using these steps, but it is cheaper and easier for miners. The worry about times when block subsidy is low is unwarranted as the cost of proof-of-work creates a lower bound to the incentive that needs to be offered. The author believes that disallowing the implementation of rational mining is not a viable option, as anyone can implement whatever optimization they think is profitable and within the rules.</p>
