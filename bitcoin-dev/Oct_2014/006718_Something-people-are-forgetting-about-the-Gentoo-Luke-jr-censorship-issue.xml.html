    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Luke-Jr wants to add code that can censor certain network traffic, such as SatoshiDice transactions because he thinks they are a denial of service. However, this could cause legal implications. The technical ability to filter certain types of network traffic can cause users to be legally liable to use it to filter illegal content, which can put Bitcoin users in legal danger. Law enforcement can try to force them to use it. It will be easier to defend an "uncensored" policy against law enforcement if the technical ability to filter stuff couldn't exist because the code just cannot. Therefore, the request is not to include the code and, if possible, not even write or publish it. A developer from <a href="https://freenetproject.org/">https://freenetproject.org/</a> requested someone to add this comment to the Gentoo bugtracker account.</p>
