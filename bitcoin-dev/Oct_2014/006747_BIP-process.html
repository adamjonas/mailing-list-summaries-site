    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Wladimir proposed creating a more formal process for managing changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository on GitHub. Currently, there are many open pull requests for various BIPs and it is unclear who should comment on them or decide on changes to be merged. All BIP changes currently have to go through the Bitcoin Core team, which creates a bottleneck in the process. To address these issues, Wladimir suggested making the author or someone they delegate to be the primary contact for each BIP, responsible for commenting on changes and accepting or rejecting them. This would distribute the decision-making process and make it less centralized. However, authors would need to adhere to BIP 1 guidelines, such as not allowing technical changes to final BIPs without community consensus. Wladimir also proposed moving the BIP discussion to a separate mailing list to reduce the workload on the bitcoin-development list, which currently serves both as a forum for Bitcoin Core implementation concerns and global changes to Bitcoin in the form of BIPs. While this proposal would help with the workflow, Wladimir noted that GitHub pulls and issues do not facilitate multistage workflows, which can cause problems when something needs to go through several steps. Additionally, some people are failing to comment on BIPs, which obstructs the decision-making process.</p>
