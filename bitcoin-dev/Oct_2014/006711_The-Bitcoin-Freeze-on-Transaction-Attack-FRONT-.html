    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the rationality of miners in the Bitcoin network. The concern is that there is a division between miners who will take kickbacks and those who won't, leading to irrational behavior. However, it's argued that rationality should not be limited to short-term gains but also consider long-term stability. It's suggested that prioritizing short-term profits over the overall health of the system can lead to potential attacks on the network. This becomes particularly problematic during times of skyrocketing difficulty levels, but as the mining arms race slows down, miners may become more settled in their approach.</p>
