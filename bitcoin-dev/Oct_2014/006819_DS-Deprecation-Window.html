    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The delay in relaying/accepting blocks based on local information is a bad idea as it can lead to the splitting of the network. Thus, miners are incentivized to connect with everyone on the network and look for double-spends to avoid being delayed. However, connecting to everyone on the network is not ideal. There is also a related concept of "discouraging" blocks which refers to mining on a previous block, but one must be careful not to break consensus. On 10/27/14 19:58, Tom Harding proposed a solution to improve the ability of bitcoin users to rely on unconfirmed transactions. The proposal can be adopted incrementally without the need for hard or soft forks. The proposal has not been implemented yet, and feedback from Bitcoin Dev is appreciated. Tom Harding is from CA, USA.</p>
