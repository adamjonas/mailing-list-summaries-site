    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on October 19, 2014, a random stranger to the project shared their opinion about splitting up the Bitcoin Core mailing list. The individual believed that there should be more discussion and that dividing the list would not help with that. The problem was not traffic but rather confusion of concerns and focus. Specifically, questions about Bitcoin Core were being asked in the same list where changes to the entire system (BIPs) should be decided, causing developers of alternative clients to not subscribe to the list. Wladimir noted that it was essential for them to follow BIP discussions; otherwise, the process would be meaningless.</p>
