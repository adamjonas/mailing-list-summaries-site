    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on October 28, 2014, Ferdinando M. Ametrano expressed his surprise at the lack of consideration for basic economic principles in mining. Another participant responded by cautioning against confusing the dismissal of Ametrano's specific thoughts with a rejection of broader economic considerations, which have already been discussed and agreed upon in previous archives. The responder notes that the consensus was not as "basic" as Ametrano suggests. Finally, the responder defends the community's decision not to rehash old arguments for Ametrano's benefit, emphasizing that this does not mean they are ignoring established economic principles.</p>
