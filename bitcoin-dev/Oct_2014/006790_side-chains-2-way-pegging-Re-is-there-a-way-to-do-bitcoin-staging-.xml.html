    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2014, a user named Daniel Murrell apologized for posting his paper to a mailing list and advertising it on his website. He explained that he was excited about the paper, but wouldn't be doing this regularly. He had posted on Reddit a few times, but didn't think there was much overlap between that site's users and the mailing list's users. Bryan Bishop responded with "unsolicited administrivia," noting that Murrell had been posting in multiple places and getting negative feedback on Reddit. Bishop suggested that Murrell tone down his message frequency, and added that he preferred discussions to happen on the mailing list.</p>
