    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the stability of a blockchain system when the block size is lower than the offered demand, resulting in a backlog. The concern is that people may not have an incentive to create transactions that will remain stuck in the backlog forever. However, the lower block size and the existence of a backlog address this issue. The poster expresses skepticism that such a situation can ever be stable because people typically do not want their transactions to be stuck in the backlog. The only scenario in which this could occur would be if someone created a business model in which lots of payments are made with fees but only clear probabilistically. Otherwise, instant demand would only ever be roughly equal to supply.</p>
