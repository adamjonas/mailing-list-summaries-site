    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user is asking about a new feature in GitHub to create task lists. Another user responds that they have been meaning to try it out. The conversation then shifts to discussing the lack of multistage workflow capabilities in GitHub pulls and issues, as well as problems with people failing to comment on things. The suggestion is made to use labels to address these issues, but the drawback is that only the repository team can set them. The discussion also suggests setting reasonable deadlines to motivate people to get involved in time. The email ends with an ad for comprehensive server monitoring with Site24x7 and a reminder that this is a Bitcoin-development mailing list.</p>
