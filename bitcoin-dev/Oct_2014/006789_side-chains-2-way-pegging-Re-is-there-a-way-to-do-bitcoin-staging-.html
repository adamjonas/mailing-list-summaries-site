    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Daniel Murrell sent a message stating that he was not trying to monetize his website, but simply wanted to create something useful. However, another user named Bryan responded with some administrivia, stating that Murrell had been posting about his site frequently and receiving negative karma scores associated with those posts. Bryan suggested toning down the frequency of posts and explained that it would be inappropriate for everyone to post all possible research sites or topical discussion sites for every paper. He also expressed his preference for discussions to happen on the mailing list. Bryan's contact information was included at the end of the message.</p>
