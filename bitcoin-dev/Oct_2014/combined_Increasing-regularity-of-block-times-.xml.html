        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On October 30, 2014, Rusty Russell proposed an algorithm to limit confirmation latency by allowing weaker blocks after a certain time. In an email thread and forum post, he shared his thoughts on the topic and asked if anyone had considered this before or knew of any flaws in the scheme. Russell provided in-depth details about the algorithm and even shared a link to his website where he outlines the "gory details" of the process.However, Gregory Maxwell responded with a note that irregularity is required for convergence, as an exact interval would cause fragmentation and prevent convergence. He further explained that the variance, being some huge multiple of the network radius, allows the network to converge. Bitcoin testnet has implemented a rule that allows lower difficulty blocks after a delay of 20 minutes, but it's not secure or intended to be so. If faster evidence that the network is working on a particular transaction set is needed, this is already possible through mechanisms like the p2pool sharechain. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, also signed off the email chain with his signature information. The Bitcoin testnet is a network that allows developers to experiment with new features and test their applications without risking actual bitcoins. If no block is found for 20 minutes, one minimum-diff block may be mined.In conclusion, Rusty Russell proposed an algorithm to place a ceiling on confirmation latency by allowing weaker blocks after a certain time, but the idea was met with some skepticism due to the requirement for irregularity to achieve convergence. Although Bitcoin testnet has a similar rule implemented, it is not secure or intended to be so. Faster evidence that the network is working on a particular transaction set is already available through mechanisms like the p2pool sharechain.</p>
