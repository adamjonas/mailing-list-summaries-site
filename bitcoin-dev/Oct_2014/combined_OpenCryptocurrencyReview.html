        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Daniel Murrell has created the "Open Cryptocurrency Review", an open forum for cryptocurrency-related research. The forum allows for discussion about research and provides a central repository for it. Although he is unsure if it's welcome in the community, he encourages others to check it out and see if there are any potential use cases for it. He hopes that by creating this platform, he can contribute to the cryptocurrency community.The "Open Cryptocurrency Review" has not received much attention yet as Daniel has not advertised it much. However, he believes that if it gets core developers talking about it and finds it useful, then others will likely be inspired to use it. Even just one discussion thread could help in this regard. Daniel emphasizes that the forum is not for profit and is merely an experiment.Overall, Daniel's goal is to create a platform where researchers can discuss and share their work related to cryptocurrency. He wants to contribute to the community and provide a central repository for research.</p>
