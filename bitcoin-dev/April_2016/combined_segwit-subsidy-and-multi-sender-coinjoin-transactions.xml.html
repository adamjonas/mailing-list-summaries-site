        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer named Kristov Atlas has questioned the impact of the 75% Segregated Witness subsidy on CoinJoin transactions and similar ones, asking if this would serve as a financial disincentive against CoinJoin transactions. However, it was noted that Coinjoin doesn't necessitate any particular behavior that is relevant in this regard. A sample of 16 transaction IDs posted on a BitcoinTalk thread showed an average ratio of 1.38 outputs to inputs, which is considered an unsustainable situation as at some point that change needs to be combined again or UTXOs will not get spent. Traditional CoinJoin transactions usually create roughly two UTXOs for every one it consumes, unless address reuse comes into play. The author notes that they do not want Schnorr signatures to be brought up in any replies since they are not on any immediate roadmap.The 75% Segregated Witness subsidy makes signature data, which does not affect the UTXO set size, 75% less expensive than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to prefer transactions that minimize the impact on the UTXO set in order to reduce fees and encourage developers to design new features that also minimize the impact on the UTXO set. While this could act as a disincentive against CoinJoin transactions, it is unclear if there is any evidence to support this claim. Segwit discount is actually advantageous for CoinJoin as it makes spending UTXOs cheaper and recovers funds that would otherwise get lost to dust.Users may sometimes split up their outputs in an effort to improve privacy, which would have the "more outputs" effect but more outputs in and of itself would not increase costs under segwit. The total cost to a user for creating an output paying themselves is both the cost of creation and the cost of eventually spending it. Segwit's cost calculation improvements shift some relative cost from spending to creation, but in these cases same users are paying both. Although for self-sends the output to input ratio doesn't matter for total costs, one should consider where other transactions are.Schnorr signatures for Bitcoin have been in the works for years, and are one of the first proposed uses of the segwit versioning. Schnorr multisignature signature aggregates would make CoinJoins massively less expensive, and if there were a disincentive, it would be far beyond eliminated by a planned use of segwit versioning. It was noted that comments like the writer's last one make it hard to see the message as a good-faith inquiry.</p>
