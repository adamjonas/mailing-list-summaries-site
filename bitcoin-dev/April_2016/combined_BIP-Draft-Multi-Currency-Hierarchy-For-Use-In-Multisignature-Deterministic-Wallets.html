        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The draft of a BIP, called bip-kefkius-multicoin-multisig, has been created to facilitate multi-currency, multisignature wallet management. The current hierarchy defined in BIP-0044 places the coin's type level above the level designating account number, which limits potential multi-currency, multisignature wallet implementations. This BIP defines a hierarchy based on BIP-0044 for deterministic wallets and is an application of BIP-0043. The hierarchy is defined as m/purpose'/wallet'/coin_type/change/address_index, with purpose being set to 'bip-kefkius-multicoin-multisig', and Wallet incremented for every wallet made to organize independent identities within the key space.Coin Type is indexed based on BIP-0044 of the coin being managed, and public derivation is used to ensure that cosigners only need to know one of each other's public keys rather than distributing public keys for each coin. Change uses 0 for public addresses and 1 for change addresses, identical to BIP-0044 behavior, and Address Index increases sequentially as it does in BIP-0044. Examples have been provided to show the path for different wallets, coins, change status, and address indices.Tyler Willis is the author of this BIP, and the status is currently draft.</p>
