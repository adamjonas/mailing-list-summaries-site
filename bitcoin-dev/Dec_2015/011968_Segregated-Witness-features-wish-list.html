    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user suggested that the sum of block and witness data should be limited to nBlockMaxSize*7/4 per block, for a maximum of 1.75 MB total. The user believes that this limit on the segwit size would allay concerns over hardware capabilities in adversarial conditions. They also argue that the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a substantial change to how Bitcoin works, affecting the block structure, transaction structure, network protocol, SPV wallet software, block explorers, and most other parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Therefore, the user suggests that developers should have time to implement code supporting the new transaction/witness formats after a final version of the code is merged. In response to the suggestion, another user listed their priorities for implementing SegWit. They believe that scalability should be the highest priority, with a focus on determining the exact block size and growth based on testing and reasonable projection. However, the deployment time frame is also important, and they prefer implementing SegWit as soon as possible, even if no new features are added. The user argues that this is not only a technical issue, but also a response to the community which has been waiting for a scaling solution for years.</p>
