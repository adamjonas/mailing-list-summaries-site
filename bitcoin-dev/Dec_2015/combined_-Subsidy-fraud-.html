        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent talk by Pieter Wuille, the term "subsidy fraud" was mentioned, leaving users curious about its meaning. The discussion revolved around a miner who claimed more in the coinbase's output than what was allowed by the subsidy and fees. This raised questions about the existence and significance of subsidy fraud in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Despite conducting searches on Google and Bitcoin Wiki, the user who posted this inquiry could not find any information regarding subsidy fraud. They proceeded to suggest that if this issue is indeed well-known, it should be explained somewhere for the benefit of others.The video linked in the message features Pieter Wuille discussing various topics related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology. However, the specific explanation or definition of subsidy fraud was not provided.It remains unclear whether subsidy fraud is a widespread problem or merely a rare occurrence within the Bitcoin community. Further research may shed light on this topic and provide more information regarding subsidy fraud and its implications.</p>
