    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the world of cryptocurrency, Tamas Blummer has suggested a potential update to the design of SW Merkle tree roots. He notes that by utilizing the unused space in the coin base input script, an additional SW Merkle tree root could be soft-forked into the design. However, he advises that any new data structure added must also have a new slot for future extension. This proposal could potentially bring about changes to the way transactions are processed and recorded within the blockchain. It is important to note that this is only a suggestion at this time and further discussions and evaluations would need to take place before any action is taken. As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more proposals like this one from Tamas Blummer. The innovative minds within the industry are constantly working to improve the technology and make it more efficient and effective. By remaining open to new ideas and suggestions, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible within the realm of digital currency.</p>
