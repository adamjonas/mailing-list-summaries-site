    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Dec 8, 2015, Gregory Maxwell wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing a proposal for a 4MB blocksize increase. He goes on to explain that SegWit, which was proposed earlier, allows for about 1.75 MB of data in the average case and up to 4 MB of data in the worst case. This would require the mining and block distribution network to have a larger safety factor to handle worst-case situations, but normally only 1.75 MB of it would be used. Maxwell suggests that a 3 MB limit would be safer, allowing for 3 MB of actual transactions to be used.Maxwell also raises concerns about SegWit being used as an accounting trick to bypass the 1 MB limit. He believes this could make things less well accounted for. The email includes an HTML attachment and a non-text attachment containing a digital signature.</p>
