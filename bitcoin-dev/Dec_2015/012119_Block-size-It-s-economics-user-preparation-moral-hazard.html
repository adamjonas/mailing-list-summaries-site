    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the implementation of a hard fork to increase the block size of Bitcoin, it was noted that a hard fork would not only affect miners but all full nodes must accept the new rules or be forked off when the hashrate percentage triggers. The use of a hashpower vote to decide whether a hardfork is accepted or not was also questioned, with the opinion that Bitcoin Core maintainers should judge if consensus for a hard fork exists and whether it is technically necessary and safe. It was suggested that a softfork may be a viable alternative to a hard fork in the short-term and could still benefit scalability in the long term. A proposal to implement BIP102 with a 75% mining majority activation was discussed as a way to let the market decide without affecting users or exchanges.</p>
