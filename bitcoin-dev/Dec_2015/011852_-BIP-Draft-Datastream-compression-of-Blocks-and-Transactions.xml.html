    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to compress Bitcoin as a programming challenge/contest to find the best possible, Bitcoin-specific compressor. According to Emin GÃ¼n Sirer, creating a self-contained exercise like this would attract new programmers into the ecosystem and discover the limits of compressibility for Bitcoin bits on a wire. The results would still be interesting even if the final compression engine is not enabled by default or merged. Gavin Andresen loved the idea and suggested building a standardized data set to test against using real data from the network. A GitHub repository known as bitcoin-corpus was created to include mempool contents and transaction receipt logs for one week across four nodes. Rusty Russell, who created the repository, plans to update it every year. There are plans to add topology information to the repository, but anonymization strategies need to be figured out first.</p>
