    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jeff Garzik and Pieter Wuille, the issue of Bitcoin Core's responsibility for deciding network consensus rules is discussed. Garzik believes that if this is the case, then Bitcoin has failed. Wuille argues that the Bitcoin Core team does not have the authority to make such decisions and that avoiding a choice is still a choice. He also suggests that the core dev team should communicate more clearly with users and media about their position on protocol changes related to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE via hard fork in the short term. Ultimately, it seems that the Bitcoin Core team wants to clarify their role and avoid any confusion or misinterpretation about their power in making decisions related to the network consensus rules.</p>
