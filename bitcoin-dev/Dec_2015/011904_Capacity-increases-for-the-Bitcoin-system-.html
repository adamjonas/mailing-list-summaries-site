    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Gavin Andresen suggested creating a 1-megabyte transaction with all inputs spending segwit (Segregated Witness) inputs. This would allow for more of these smaller inputs to fit into the block, and each would hash close to one megabyte of data. However, witness size comes out at 0.25% of the 1MB, meaning it is not possible to create a block with signatures that has the full 1MB of data under the sighash while also having external signatures. Andresen believes that designing for success means being able to adapt and cope with uncertainty. While he agrees that things should be made simpler rather than more complex, he argues that nothing he has advocated creates significant technical debt. He also thinks that worries about theoretical future problems have prevented consensus on simple solutions, causing delays. Andresen believes we need to move past this and get back on track with progress in capacity and other areas.</p>
