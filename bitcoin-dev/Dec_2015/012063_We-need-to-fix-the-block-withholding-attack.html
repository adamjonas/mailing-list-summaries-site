    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email dated 12/19/15, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer corrected Chris Priest's confusion between attacks and selfish mining, stating that selfish mining guarantees profits for any pool over 33%. He added that this is a concern for the Bitcoin community and has been fixed by Ethereum. Sirer also disagreed with fixing the "attack" on mining pools, saying it promotes mining pool statism and gives existing mining pools an advantage over new ones. However, if the technique results in too many pools getting shut down and the difficulty decreases, then it might be time to address the issue as it affects the security of the network.</p>
