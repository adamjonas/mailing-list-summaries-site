    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion regarding the time it will take for full node adoption of proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), Pieter Wuille mentioned that even non-controversial proposals like BIP65 and BIP66 took significantly longer than expected. However, these were deemed uninteresting by most people which resulted in a slow adoption rate for full nodes. Wuille noted that encouraging full node upgrades would be necessary when a hard fork is eventually implemented to increase blocksize. To ensure success, miners may be asked to wait until a certain percentage of visible full nodes have been upgraded.</p>
