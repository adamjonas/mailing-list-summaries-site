    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The latest Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), such as BIP202, have established that the maximum block size is determined by the block time. However, from a pool's perspective, it is difficult to issue a job with a fixed ntime due to the existence of ntime roll. This makes it challenging to determine the maximum block size for issuing a job. Developers find it much simpler and more elegant to implement a function of block height instead of time for determining the maximum block size. Block height is considered a better alternative because it is easier to work with and more straightforward than time. In conclusion, while BIPs have set a precedent for the maximum block size being based on block time, there are challenges in implementing this rule for pools and developers. The use of block height is seen as a more efficient and logical alternative.</p>
