    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list proposed adding opcodes to make Script Turing Pseudo-Complete, as suggested by Wright. However, another member responded that there is no need for a BIP draft and that using a normal computer language with preferred algorithm libraries and development tools would suffice if that capability is needed. The specification of such a language is trivial; it is the economics of validation that is complex due to proving whether or not a program will halt as expected being near impossible for most complex programs. A working example of provable execution can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jgarzik/moxiebox">https://github.com/jgarzik/moxiebox</a>. The original proposal included adding a return stack alongside the existing control stack and several opcodes such as OP_DEFINITION_START, OP_DEFINITION_END, OP_FUNCTION_NAME, OP_CALL, OP_RETURN_FROM_CALL_AND_CONTINUE, and OP_NAMESPACE. These opcodes would allow for the creation of new functions, marking transactions as valid, debiting calling transactions, creating new transactions, and more.</p>
