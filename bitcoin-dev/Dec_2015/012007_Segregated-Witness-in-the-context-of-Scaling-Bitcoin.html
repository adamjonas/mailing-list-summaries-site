    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim√≥n raised the point that 2mb x4 is already equivalent to the 2-4-8 compromise proposal with bip102 and SW. However, sickpig--- via bitcoin-dev highlighted that SegWit as proposed gives a 75% discount to witness data with the same limit. So, at a 1MB limit, that might give you eg) 2.05MB made up of 650kB of base block data plus 1.4MB of witness data. A 2-2 multisig transaction with segregated witness is made up of 94B of base data, plus about 214B of witness data, which gives about a 2.03x gain, not a 4x gain. Further improvements can be achieved with 3-of-3 multisig, but to get to the theoretical 4x gain, a fairly degenerate-looking transaction would be needed. Pay to public key hash with segwit lets move about half the transaction data into the witness, giving about a 1.6x improvement by aj's count. Therefore, a gain of between 1.6 and 2.0 is a reasonable expectation for the proposed segwit scheme overall.</p>
