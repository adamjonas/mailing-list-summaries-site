    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Chris Priest and an unknown recipient, the topic of sweeping a paper wallet created in 2013 was discussed. Chris Priest questioned whether contacting an "archive node" to obtain UTXO data before making a transaction would be better than how the system works today. The unknown recipient responded by stating that if one has a paper wallet with only a private key, they would not know what coins have been assigned to it or their TXids. In order to find this information, one would need to contact a public index or synchronize the full blockchain history. These methods are also sufficient for STXO and provide one with more data. If one were to run a full node, they would not have to wait for synchronization and would be their own archive. None of these cases result in a loss of data.</p>
