        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille raised concerns about the risk of an old full node wallet accepting a transaction that is invalid to the new rules. However, Jonathan Toomim argued that this would not be a problem as the receiver wallet chooses what address/script to accept coins on and would upgrade to the new softfork rules before creating an address that depends on the softfork's features.To illustrate the issue further, Mallory wants to defraud Bob with a 1 BTC payment for some beer. Bob runs the old rules and creates a p2pkh address for Mallory to use. Mallory then creates an invalid SegWit transaction that Bob cannot properly validate and that pays into one of Mallory's wallets. Mallory immediately spends the unconfirmed transaction into Bob's address resulting in a valid-looking transaction chain, which is not actually valid. However, if Bob is fully validating, he should see that Mallory's signature is not on a transaction with his address.The discussion also highlighted potential fraud scenarios involving SegWit transactions, including one where Mallory defrauds Bob for beer by creating an invalid transaction, which Clueless Carol includes in her block, resulting in Mallory getting free beer. The email thread then moved on to discuss the distinction between softforks and hardforks. The writer believes that the distinction between softforks and hardforks is not as clear-cut as previously thought. They suggest that softforks should have a minimum median time deployment day, rather than header.nTime. In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Eric Lombrozo raises concerns regarding the risks of any consensus rule changes. He notes that such changes can lead to non-full-validating or non-upgraded nodes seeing invalid confirmations, but if a large supermajority (i.e. > 95%) of hashing power is behind the new rule, it is unlikely that many invalid confirmations will be seen by anyone. The discussion also notes the risks of non-upgraded nodes seeing invalid confirmations and how this can be exploited. It is suggested that soft forks should have a minimum median time deployment day, rather than header.nTime. A hypothetical scenario of fraud involving a payment for beer is discussed, highlighting potential issues arising from non-upgraded nodes and how they can be exploited. There is also a scenario where an attacker creates a majority chain that follows the old rules but not the new ones, resulting in dropping non-upgraded nodes to a form of SPV security without their consent. Non-upgraded nodes would accept a transaction on what they believe to be the consensus chain only to find out that when they try to spend those coins, no one accepts them because they were part of an invalid chain.The writer presented four failure modes and analyzed the risks associated with them, concluding that although they prefer all full nodes to enforce all rules, the security reduction is not significant, and soft forks offer security advantages. Additionally, they suggest that if users are concerned about the security degradation a soft fork might bring, they can configure their node to treat a (signalled) softfork as a hardfork. The discussion emphasizes the importance of upgrading mining nodes and the potential risks associated with unconfirmed transactions. In general, leaving standardness checks turned on and waiting for six confirmations before accepting any non-standard transaction should be enough to keep one safe from any attack a soft-fork might enable. Upgrading software regularly should also be enough to keep one safe for any soft-fork and hard-fork.</p>
