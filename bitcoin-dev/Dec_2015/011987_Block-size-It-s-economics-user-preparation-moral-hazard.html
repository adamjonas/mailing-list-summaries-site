    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a miners' round table discussion, one of the developers stated that he did not want to be seen as the decision maker for Bitcoin. However, Chinese miners repeatedly mentioned that they wanted several concrete proposals from the devs which they could choose. The writer believes that there is no contradiction between these two viewpoints. Additionally, the writer supports an early and conservative increase in Bitcoin's block size limit, such as BIP102 or 2-4-8, in order to avoid a radical "Economic Change Event" in the next halving cycle. They suggest that 2MB is accepted by most people and better than nothing for BIP101 proponents, and that the increase should be effective by May, at least two months before the halving. The writer's most optimistic guess is that Segregated Witness will be ready in six months, which will be very close to the halving and potential transaction volume burst. However, it may not be done in 2016 as it also involves a change in the p2p protocol and wallet design.</p>
