    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, two individuals express their support for the "Capacity Increases for the Bitcoin System" plan. They believe that it will solve longstanding problems with scalability and make bitcoin more stable and robust. While they acknowledge concerns and complications related to SegWit, they feel that navel-gazing and bikeshedding will only play into the hands of those with less than noble intentions. One individual also wants to reiterate his belief in a short-term bump to capacity increases, hopefully chosen by this summer so that everybody can start to prepare. He believes that simple solutions work best and talked to miners who prefer them too. He thinks this is the only thing he's seen that strikes him as having any real shot at consensus. However, he acknowledges that a permanent block size solution isn't feasible right now and that discussions should continue towards a more permanent solution. Overall, both individuals are in favor of capacity increases for the bitcoin system plan and want to see progress made.</p>
