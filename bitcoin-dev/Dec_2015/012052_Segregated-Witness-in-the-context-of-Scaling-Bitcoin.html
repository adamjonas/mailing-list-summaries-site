    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the consensus block limit and disk space required for validation. The two are often perceived as the same, leading to confusion. It is asserted that scaling solutions can address both, but to different extents. The value of "kicking the can" is discussed in light of having more time to make better changes, at the cost of suffering through the unsolved problem for a longer duration. It is suggested that whether or not there is a massive campaign targeting current bitcoiners affects upgrade rates significantly. The email also contains technical details about the possible block size limits with Segwit and BIP 102, along with the gains expected from them. It is noted that the gain would be between 1.6 to 2.0, leading to a proposed maximum virtual block size of 3.6 MB. The email signature showcases the author's skills and links to their work.</p>
