        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context revolves around the proposal of Segregated Witness (SegWitness or SW) as a solution to scalability issues in Bitcoin. The proposal creates two views of each transaction and block, with older clients seeing the core block limited to 1MB, while newer clients use extended blocks for additional data storage. However, the roll-out pace of SW is slow, requiring updates to bitcoin-core and bitcoinj, wallet software, and programmer libraries, adding many months to the timeline. Additionally, SW introduces new economic complexities, inviting enhanced game theory and bidding structure risks.There are several proposals on the table for increasing block sizes, including SegWit soft fork (SWSF) with a 1MB virtual block limit that equals approximately to a 2MB actual limit, and BIP102, which has an actual 2MB limit. In general, both proposals have similar benefits but different costs (e.g., bandwidth, latency, storage costs for nodes). While BIP 102 is automatically compatible with most ecosystem software, SW requires merchants to upgrade almost immediately.It is suggested that a "short term bump" hard fork block size increase should proceed in parallel with SW, independent tracks, as orthogonal issues. A hard fork block size increase addresses ecosystem risks that SW does not. Hard forks provide much stronger validation, ensuring the network operates at a fully trustless level. An SW hard fork could also add several zero-filled placeholders in a Merkle tree for future use.However, there are also issues with a hard fork, including DoS vectors and complex economic policy. SW increases capacity while leaving worst-case effects constant, but it creates two fee markets, leading to more complex economic policy and bidding structures. The current SW mining algorithm also needs improvement.Overall, the email thread discusses the pros and cons of different proposals for addressing scalability issues in Bitcoin. It is recommended to evaluate them separately and on their own merits rather than arguing against working on one just because you're in favor of doing the other ASAP.</p>
