    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post discusses the theoretical limit of what is possible to do with a soft fork, assuming constant hashrate. It suggests that if a soft fork forces miners to discard 25% of their blocks, the difficulty will drop by 75% to keep things balanced. The block interval will only increase until the next re-target. Slowly increasing the fraction of blocks thrown away gives the re-target algorithm time to adjust, which is an advantage. However, the increased variance is still unaccounted for, and larger block intervals would occur even with compensation. Additionally, practicality of deployment and usability are problematic.</p>
