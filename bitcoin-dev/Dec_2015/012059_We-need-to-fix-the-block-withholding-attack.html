    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation on bitcoin-dev, Chris Priest claimed that block withholding attacks can only be carried out by someone with a majority of hashpower. In response, jl2012 pointed out that an attacker with just 0.5% of the hash rate could sabotage 10% of a pool's income, which could potentially kill the pool. Despite this possibility, there are still many pools in operation. Priest argued that since those with all the hashpower haven't engaged in this behavior yet, it is currently only a theoretical attack. He also stated that even if someone with a lot of hashpower were to pull off the attack, they wouldn't be able to disrupt much. Nonetheless, jl2012's warning highlights the need for further research into mitigating block withholding attacks.</p>
