    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developers jl2012 and Pieter Wuille are working on submitting three separate BIPs related to SEGWIT implementation. The first BIP is the Consensus BIP which covers witness structures and their commitment to blocks, cost metrics and limits, scripting system (witness programs), and soft fork mechanism. This BIP has been submitted as a draft and is awaiting BIP number assignment.The second BIP is the Peer Services BIP that focuses on relay message structures, witnesstx serialization, and other issues pertaining to the p2p protocol such as IBD, synchronization, tx and block propagation, etc. The third BIP is the Applications BIP that addresses scriptPubKey encoding formats and other wallet interoperability concerns.The Peer Services BIP and the Applications BIP will be drafted soon.</p>
