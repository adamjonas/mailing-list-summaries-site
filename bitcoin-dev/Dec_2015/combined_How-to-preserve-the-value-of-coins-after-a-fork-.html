        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin-United is a technique that aims to create a cohesive coin even when there is no consensus at the lowest level. This technique enables new coins to be minted on both chains while preserving the maximum of 21 million by creating a one-to-one correspondence between coins on both chains. The concept of transaction equivalence and its vulnerability to malleability issues are discussed in Emin Gün Sirer's message. Bitcoin-United relies on this notion, which involves transactions being equal if they consume the same inputs and result in the same outputs, disregarding miner fees.Multikey transactions are evaluated for equivalency by their inputs and outputs, allowing a 2-out-of-3 payment to be signed by different sets of two keys. However, multisig transactions are usually hidden behind p2sh, making it difficult to know what keys are involved. Peter Todd points out that many transactions are still malleable and can be intentionally triggered by third parties, making Bitcoin United susceptible to diverge and fail. Therefore, achieving convincing consensus through proof of stake voting or Adam Bank's extension block suggestions may be simpler and more predictable solutions.Despite these technical and economic criticisms of the proposal, the authors of Bitcoin-United are actively working on questions and looking for feedback. They acknowledge that the technique opens up new game-theoretic questions, such as what happens to native clients who prefer one chain or the other. However, the technique provides some hope about future consensus to the community. In conclusion, Bitcoin-United is a technique that creates a cohesive coin even when there is no consensus at the lowest level. It enables new coins to be minted on both chains while preserving the maximum of 21 million by creating a one-to-one correspondence between coins on both chains. Although there are technical and economic criticisms of the proposal, the authors are actively working on questions and looking for feedback.</p>
