    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses various types of forks, including firm hard forks that can make format changes which are not possible with soft-forks. The email includes several links to discussions about auxiliary blocks and evil soft-forks or forced soft-forks, as well as soft-fork block size increase using extension blocks. There is also information on generalized soft-forks and bip102 forced soft-forks. Extension blocks and sidechains are discussed in older conversations. Discussions about evil forks and evil soft-forks and extension blocks are also included. Segwit soft-fork is mentioned as making use of a similar idea. The concept of "forced soft-fork" is discussed and explained as being pretty much the same thing as an "evil fork."</p>
