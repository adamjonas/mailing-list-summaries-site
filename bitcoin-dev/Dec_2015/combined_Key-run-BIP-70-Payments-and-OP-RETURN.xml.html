        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Toby has developed a new publication platform called key.run, which is based on Bitcoin. The platform is designed to store BitTorrent info hashes in the blockchain through transactions sent to a "namespace" Bitcoin address. By using SPV (Simple Payment Verification), the key.run database can be reconstructed from the blockchain. It is meant to be an open source and distributed system that allows anyone to run the key.run server.Toby's goal was to allow users to utilize their existing Bitcoin wallets to encode key.run transactions on the blockchain. This was achieved by building the transactions with the proper OP_RETURN value server-side and passing them to the end user's wallet via BIP-70. However, Bitcoin Core doesn't allow BIP-70 PaymentDetails to contain outputs with zero value, which poses a problem since key.run transactions work by giving the OP_RETURN outputs a non-zero dust value.Toby believes that OP_RETURN outputs with zero value should be allowed as they are valid transactions. He is seeking feedback on whether there is an alternative way to accomplish his proposal or if BIP-70 could be adjusted to allow for OP_RETURN outputs with zero value. Overall, Toby hopes to create a more accessible and user-friendly platform for storing BitTorrent info hashes in the blockchain.</p>
