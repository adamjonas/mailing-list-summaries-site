    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email chain, Jonathan Toomim suggested that data should not be included in the coinbase and instead be used by developers. However, this has never been guaranteed and soft forks are not considered a "dev action." Toomim proposed that a hard fork would be better for SegWit as it reduces fraud proof size, simplifies the design and is safer for clients who do not upgrade timely. He suggested that while working on a SegWit softfork, they should also work on a hardfork to simplify merge-mining in general. Toomim opposed the idea of invalidating the security assumptions of non-upgraded clients with SegWit, stating that no data was better than invalid data, but there isn't an option for "no data" in a hardfork for non-upgraded nodes and leaves them vulnerable to attacking miners. Therefore, the alternatives are either degraded security for old nodes in a softfork or complete loss of all security for old nodes in a hardfork.</p>
