        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the Bitcoin community, "mining centralization" is a highly debated topic. While some argue that mining is already centralized, others believe it is not the case. Under normal operations, a single mining pool would have no effect on the system, but it could be problematic if the pool censored transactions or operated outside of the norm. However, if all hashpower was under one control, this could be an issue if hashpower liquidity is low. Hashpower liquidity measures how easily hashpower can move from one pool to another.If all the mining hardware is mining on one pool and cannot switch to another, then hashpower liquidity is low. Conversely, if there are many pools in existence and mining hardware owners can easily switch to another pool, then hashpower liquidity is high. This is crucial because if a single mining pool started censoring transactions and there was no other pool to move to, it would be bad for Bitcoin.Therefore, the author argues that hashpower liquidity is a more important metric than simply "mining centralization." The difference between the two terms is that one describes a temporary condition, while the other measures a more permanent condition. Instead of focusing on mining centralization, people should focus on increasing hashpower liquidity.</p>
