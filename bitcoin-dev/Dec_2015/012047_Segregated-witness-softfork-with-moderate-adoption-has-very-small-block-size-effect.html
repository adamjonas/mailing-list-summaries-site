    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the discussion about client-side adoption of SW, Santino Napolitano disagrees with the belief that it indicates a preference for larger blocks. He suggests that businesses could attach an OP_RETURN output indicating their preference or provide hand-signed letters and media interviews to explicitly state their desires. However, these measures may not accurately reflect Bitcoin usage as English-language measures can be misleading and non-Western economic activity is significant. Centralized forums such as Twitter and Reddit are also easily censored and manipulated. Peter Todd adds an anecdote about a friend who made a Bitcoin-related product with non-culturally-specific appeal and found that the majority of sales went to non-English-speaking countries. Peter also highlights the need to include non-law-abiding stakeholders in consensus-building processes.</p>
