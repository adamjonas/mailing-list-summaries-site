    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of quadratic CHECK(MULTI)SIG execution time can be resolved by implementing a soft-fork which limits SignatureHash() to only return true if the transaction size is 100KB. The proposed solution would technically allow transactions, but there would be no way for them to spend coins that are cryptographically secured. This fix could be deployed as a soft-fork within a matter of days, making it an effective solution in case of issues with major miners exploiting slow-to-propagate blocks to harm their competitors. A link to an article on bitcoin-development lists the issue being discussed. The proposal was put forward by 'peter' who can be reached at peter@petertodd.org.</p>
