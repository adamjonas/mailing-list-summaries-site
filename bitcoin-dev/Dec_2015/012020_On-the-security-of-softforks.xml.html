    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer believes that the distinction between softforks and hardforks is not as clear-cut as previously thought. They suggest that softforks should have a minimum median time deployment day, rather than header.nTime. The email thread then moves on to a discussion of potential fraud scenarios involving SegWit transactions. One scenario involves Mallory defrauding Bob with a 1 BTC payment for beer by creating an invalid SegWit transaction that pays into one of Mallory's wallets. Clueless Carol, who has not upgraded her mining node, includes both transactions in her block, allowing Mallory to receive free beer. The email concludes with a response stating that 0-conf and 1-conf are not safe, and that the suggested scenario is a variation of the Finney attack.</p>
