        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing proposals to increase the block size limit, with two options being Segregated Witness (SegWit) and BIP102. While there is support for a combination of fast BIP102 and slow SWSF as a potential solution, concerns have been raised about the limitations of SegWit as a short-term scaling solution, including the creation of two separate resources with different levels of contention, which complicates block economics and makes it difficult to predict fees.Technical details about SW's service, including definitions for various terms, are also discussed in the email thread on bitcoin-dev. There are debates about the proposed miner selection algorithm for block size increases and whether CLTV transactions are less secure than others. The discussion revolves around the potential gains from implementing SegWit and BIP 102, along with the consensus block limit and disk space required for validation.The email exchange also highlights concerns over the two separate, supply-limited resources created by SW that complicates block economics and new under-analyzed attack surfaces. While there seems to be support for a SW soft fork initially, with a plan to eventually move to a hard fork with a higher block size limit and better commitment structure in about two years, others argue that a "short term bump" hard fork block size increase may better address economic and ecosystem risks than SW, which creates two fee markets and introduces new complexities and risks.Pieter Wuille proposes defining the virtual block size as the base size plus witness size multiplied by 0.25, and limiting it to 1MB, creating a single variable to optimize for. The email conversation also discusses the pace of roll-out, new attack surfaces, and more complex economic policy. Ultimately, there is a call to proceed with both options independently as orthogonal issues.The responsibility of the ecosystem is to ensure that actions taken do not result in people losing money without providing them with enough opportunity to fix it. A clear decision and roadmap could be made now, as this topic has been discussed to death.Segregated Witness (segwit) and BIP102 are two proposals on the table, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. It is asserted that scaling solutions can address both consensus block limit and disk space required for validation, but to different extents. SW creates two views of each transaction and block, with blocks (limit 1M) and extended blocks, and transactions and extended transactions.The major criticism of a hardfork is that everyone needs to upgrade, but there is evidence from BIP50 and BIP66 that suggests a five-month pre-announcement is good enough for a simple hardfork. Matt Corallo via bitcoin-dev argues that SW will be quicker to deploy than a hard fork, which could take up to two years after the code is shipped. However, Jeff Garzik via bitcoin-dev raises concerns about the slow pace of rollout and the fact that SW creates two fee markets with separate and distinct behaviors and resource values, thus creating more complexity and risks. Additionally, there are new under-analyzed attack surfaces to consider.One proposal presents SW instead of a hard fork block size increase. The rollout pace for SW is expected to be slow, requiring wallet software and programmer libraries needing upgrades that will take 12+ months in some stacks. On the other hand, a simple hard fork such as BIP 102 is automatically compatible with most of today's ecosystem software, unlike SW which requires merchants to upgrade almost immediately.The email conversation between Anthony Towns and others in the Bitcoin development community discusses the potential gains of implementing Segregated Witness (SegWit) alongside BIP 102. SegWit provides a 75% discount to witness data with the same limit, allowing for more efficient use of block space. The email concludes that BIP 102 + SW would bring a gain between 2*1.6 and 2*2, potentially allowing for a maximum virtual block size of 3.6 MB.It is unlikely that SW provides scaling in the short term, and it introduces new economic complexities. A "short term bump" hard fork block size increase addresses the economic and ecosystem risks that SW does not. Bump + SW should proceed in parallel, independent tracks, as orthogonal issues.</p>
