    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion, Justus Ranvier suggested that Pieter Wuille's proposed time frame of 6 to 12 months for an uncontroversial hard fork was just a stalling tactic. However, Bryan countered that there hasn't been any stalling regarding an uncontroversial hard-fork deployment and claimed that Justus may be confusing the issue with discussions over various (hard-forking) block size proposals. He pointed out that the uncontroversial hard-fork proposals from six months ago were mostly along the lines of jtimon's proposals, which were not about capacity. Bryan also refuted Justus' claim that there had been six months of "stonewalling" or "denial" about an uncontroversial hard-fork proposal, stating that there has been extensive discussion regarding the controversial properties of other block size proposals. Finally, Bryan argued that the term "capacity emergency" is too ambiguous in this context because of competing concerns and tradeoffs regarding transaction rate capacity exhaustion versus p2p low-bandwidth node bandwidth exhaustion.</p>
