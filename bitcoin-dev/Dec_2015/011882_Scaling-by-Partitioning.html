    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Akiva Lichtner discusses his proposal for sharding coins themselves instead of the mining work, which he believes could have the potential for scalability. He explains that different parts of the coin space would be forever segregated, never ending up in the same block. This means that a fraction of money could make it into a block in ten minutes while the rest could take two hours. Akiva acknowledges that his idea is not exactly scaling Bitcoin's present requirements, but rather relaxing the requirements in a way that leaves both users and miners happy. Bryan Bishop suggests that Akiva's proposal is similar to the sharding proposals previously discussed by the community. However, Akiva believes that there is a big difference conceptually. Finally, Akiva thanks Bryan for pointing out his mistake of hitting "reply" instead of "reply all" earlier.</p>
