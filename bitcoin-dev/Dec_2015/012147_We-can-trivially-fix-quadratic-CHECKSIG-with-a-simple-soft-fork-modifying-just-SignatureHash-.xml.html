    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, Jonathan Toomim addressed concerns about potential complaints regarding a soft fork. Toomim suggested that announcing the intention to perform a soft fork a couple of months before it becomes active and ensuring that nobody complains about it destroying their secret stash would be sufficient. However, another member, jl2012, raised the question of whether someone may have a time-locked big transaction with a lost private key. Toomim responded by stating that it is an unlikely scenario and that consensus rules should be established as a social contract to prevent breaking them without exceptional circumstances. The discussion highlights the importance of considering potential issues and establishing clear rules and communication when making changes to the bitcoin network.</p>
