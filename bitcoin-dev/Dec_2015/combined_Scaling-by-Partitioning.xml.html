        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Akiva Lichtner proposed an idea for scaling Bitcoin that involves running more than one simultaneous chain, each chain defeating double spending on only part of the coin. The coin would be partitioned by radix or modulus. For example, ten parallel chains could be run to multiply throughput by a factor of ten. Blocks would have to contain the number of the partition they belong to, and miners would need to round-robin through partitions to prevent attackers from having an unfair advantage. Payment recipients would need to operate a daemon for each chain, thus guaranteeing no scaling advantage.However, Loi Luu, one of the authors of the SCP protocol, questioned this proposal and wondered how transactions that spend a "coin" that ends in "1" and creates a new coin that ends in "1" should be processed. He also noted that sharding does not bring any advantages if the amount of data needed to broadcast immediately to the network increases linearly with the number of transactions that the network can process. Luu suggested that their SCP protocol can localize the bandwidth used, but recipients need to verify whether a transaction is double-spending. Despite this tradeoff, he believed that SCP provides potential scalability.Akiva responded, stating that since partitions are completely segregated, there is no need for a node to work on multiple partitions simultaneously. However, for attacks to be defeated, a node needs to be able to work on multiple partitions in turn, not at the same time. Akiva believes that Bitcoin will only scale when pragmatic considerations take center stage and the academic goals take a lower priority. He thinks companies would make a good living out of running trusted verification services. It doesn't mean there is a bank, but there can be pockets of trust, which is natural because most people trust at least one other person.Loi Luu proposed the SCP protocol, which localizes bandwidth usage but requires recipients to verify whether a transaction is double-spending. In response, Akiva believes that since partitions are completely segregated, there is no need for a node to work on multiple partitions simultaneously. However, for attacks to be defeated, a node needs to be able to work on multiple partitions in turn, not at the same time.Furthermore, there are concerns about the effectiveness of simply splitting coins into several partitions. Some experts have expressed doubts about the proposal compared to other solutions such as Luu's SCP protocol. Loi Luu proposed using sharding to localize bandwidth usage instead of partitioning coins or transactions. He suggested that their SCP protocol can localize the bandwidth used, but recipients need to verify whether a transaction is double-spending. Despite this tradeoff, he believed that SCP provides potential scalability.Akiva responds to Luu's comments, stating that his proposal would work since partitions are completely segregated, but it would require nodes to work on multiple partitions in turn to defeat attacks. He also thanked Luu for his feedback and stated that he will take a closer look at Luu's SCP protocol. Akiva's idea proposes to scale Bitcoin by running more than one simultaneous chain, with each chain defeating double spending on only part of the coin, partitioned by radix or modulus. The number of chains could increase automatically over time based on the moving average of transaction volume, and blocks would have to contain the partition number they belong to.Finally, Akiva discusses his proposal for sharding coins themselves instead of the mining work. Different parts of the coin space would be forever segregated, never ending up in the same block, allowing a fraction of money to make it into a block in ten minutes while the rest could take two hours. While there would be little impact on miners, clients would have to send multiple messages to spend money on different partitions, and client messages would need to enumerate coins using compression to save space. Payment recipients would also need to operate a daemon for each chain. With available technology, there are fundamental trade-offs between scale and decentralization.</p>
