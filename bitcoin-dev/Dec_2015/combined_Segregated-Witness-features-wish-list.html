        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There are ongoing discussions in the Bitcoin community regarding which scaling solutions should be deployed first. Some suggest that versionBits should come first, while others believe that seg-witness is more important due to its safety and speed. The author of a proposal advocates for deploying seg-witness via soft-fork first, as it requires a robust malleability fix that is crucial for smart-contracts and scalability features like faster transactions.Developers are continuously working towards improving Bitcoin technology. Proposed solutions include segregated IBLT and best practices to reduce miner's concerns about centralization risk. Off-topic discussions include redesigning P2Pool to use DAGs for decentralized hashing and the benefits of OP_CODESEPARATOR for sighash type proposals.In an email thread discussing minimal consensus rule changes needed for segwit softfork, it was suggested that OP_NOP4 be renamed as OP_SEGWIT. Other suggestions included placing witness commitment in the coinbase or an OP_RETURN output in a specific transaction and determining the size limit of the witness. There should also be an upper limit for the number of sum criteria to prevent malicious miners from feeding unlimited amounts of garbage to other nodes. The implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a substantial change to how Bitcoin works and affects various parts of the ecosystem. Therefore, developers need time to implement code supporting the new transaction/witness formats after a final version of the code is merged.The priority for implementing Segregated Witness (SW) should be on scalability and safety first, with witness size limit increased to allow a bigger overall block size, with 2MB being considered safe. Promoting safety and reducing trust level comes next, and offline signing could be made easier with SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE proposal. Compact proof of violations like fee, sigopcount, size etc., can be part of the witness hash tree. Standardness rules like BIP62 and OP_IF malleability fix are necessary to make relay more efficient. Some new features like enabling OP_CAT, which allows tree signatures, could be implemented. M-of-n multisig could become more efficient even without Schnorr signature. Multi-party channels, as well as payment decorrelation, could enhance privacy.In summary, there is a push to implement code that will increase witness size limits and decrease deployment time frames to support new transaction/witness formats. The highest priority for implementing SegWit is scalability and safety, with the focus on determining the exact block size and growth based on testing and reasonable projection. Companies can also contribute to improving decentralization by configuring better setups and using self-hosted nodes.</p>
