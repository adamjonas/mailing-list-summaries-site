    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is in support of the plan laid out in "Capacity increases for the bitcoin system" as it solves several longstanding problems in Bitcoin and improves scalability considerably. The writer believes it's time to stop bikeshedding, start implementing, and move forward to avoid losing more developers to the toxic atmosphere created by the hard-fork debacle. The proposal is to work towards the soft-fork SegWit 4MB block which increases capacity and scalability, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth increases safer long term. This plan allows progress without being forced to make a possibly divisive choice for one hardfork or another yet. Soft-fork SegWit can help us out of this deadlock, give a short-term capacity bump, show the world that scalability is being worked on, and solve several unrelated problems at the same time (fraud proofs, script extensibility, malleability, etc.). Pieter Wuille supports this plan and believes it will improve productivity and health of the community.</p>
