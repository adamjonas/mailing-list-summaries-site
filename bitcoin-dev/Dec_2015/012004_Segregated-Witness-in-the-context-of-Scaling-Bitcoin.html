    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer agrees that the safety of a pre-hardfork upgrade period depends on the complexity of changes, and less than 6 months for a hardfork is too short. For a more complex hardfork, such as a SW hardfork or a collection of many little fixes, the writer suggests 1 year or more would make more sense. BIP99 recommends a time threshold + 95% miner upgrade confirmation with BIP9. The writer proposes deploying BIP102 when it's ready + 6 median time months + 95% miner upgrade confirmation, followed by deploying SW when it's ready + 95% miner upgrade confirmation via BIP9. Bip9's implementation is critical to both proposals. The writer notes that bip102 + SW is already equivalent to the 2-4-8 "compromise" proposal but never liked it because nobody should compromise anything, and delaying an unavoidable economic change is not reasonable.</p>
