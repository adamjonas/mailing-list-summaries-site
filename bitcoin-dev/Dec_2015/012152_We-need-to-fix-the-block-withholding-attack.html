    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing a proposal to alter the block-selection mechanism when two block solutions appear at nearly the same time. The proposed key components include computing BitcoinDaysDestroyed using only transactions that have been in the mempool for some time as old BTCDD, using "nearly the same time" to mean separated in time by the guess of the average duration of block propagation times, and building on the one that has the most old BTCDD rather than the one that came in first. The goal of this change is to reduce the profitability of withholding block solutions by reducing the chances that a block solved a while ago can orphan one solved recently. The proposal also suggests that "most oBTCDD" is less easily gamed than "came in first." Dave Scotese via bitcoin-dev will write a BIP if anyone agrees it's a good idea.In response to Scotese's proposal, Ivan Brightly via bitcoin-dev asks why the focus is on bandwidth/network reliability/stability versus electricity contracts or vertically integrated chip manufacturers. He argues that network bandwidth is a more broadly available commodity than electricity and questions whether a stranded hydroelectric miner is any more desirable than thousands of dorm room miners with access to 10gbit university connections and free electricity. Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev raises concerns about network propagation effects between large and small miners, stating that if you are in an environment where selfish mining is possible, the profitability difference between small and large miners even without attacks going on is a hugely worrying problem.</p>
