        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context advocates for a "can kick" proposal for Bitcoin. This proposal would entail a block size limit of 2 to 4 MB, a hard fork with consensus mechanisms similar to BIP101, a 1-2 month delay before activation to allow miners to upgrade their infrastructure, and a validation cost metric such as BIP101's or a UTXO growth metric. The author intends to work on block propagation improvements over the next few months to potentially increase the block size further in the future. It is important to note that this proposal is not without its critics, as some argue that increasing the block size could lead to centralization and less security for the network. However, the author believes that the proposed changes could help alleviate current issues with slow transaction times and high fees.Overall, the author is in favor of taking a measured approach to updating the Bitcoin protocol, rather than rushing into significant changes that could have unintended consequences. By implementing a "can kick" proposal, the community can address immediate concerns while also allowing for further improvements in the future.</p>
