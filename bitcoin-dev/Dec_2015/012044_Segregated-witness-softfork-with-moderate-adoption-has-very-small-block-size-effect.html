    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On a Bitcoin developer mailing list, a user named jl2012 expressed doubt that Segregated Witness (SW) would be the only short-term solution for scaling. Another user responded that they did not believe SW was relevant to scalability and that fraud-proof systems were important for network security as the current system places too much trust in miners. Adding a fraud proof system to blocks would make other features like committed UTXO sets less risky to deploy. The user also stated that solving transaction malleability would be a nice feature but the main concern is buying time for continued usage growth while working on creating a situation where it becomes safe to eliminate the maximum block size as a consensus rule. No other significant details or context were provided.</p>
