    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tomas and Luke on December 30, 2015, they discuss the efficiency and implementation of version bits in the context of proposing changes to the Bitcoin network. Tomas expresses concern over the inefficiency of the current system and suggests that clarification is needed for assigning version bits. Luke proposes that the BIP editor assign version bits similarly to BIP numbers. Tomas further suggests that his proposal addresses the danger of forward-incompatible changes and eliminates the possibility of a hard fork, but Luke disagrees. He points out that a hard fork can always occur as it is determined by the economy and not miners. Additionally, changes such as a PoW algorithm change could still lead to further rule changes.</p>
