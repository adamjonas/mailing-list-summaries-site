    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Jonathan Toomim, they discussed scalability issues in Bitcoin. Toomim suggested that increasing the block size limit would not reduce the safety factor for unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), which is a more unsolved concern. However, Maxwell argued that UTXO is not currently a bottleneck on block size as miners can afford more RAM than 1 GB. He believes that block propagation time is currently the bottleneck. In response, Toomim acknowledged that he is less concerned about the safety factor issue than others may be, but still pays attention to it for political reasons. Maxwell also mentioned improvements that could address risks created by malicious behavior of miners.</p>
