    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2015, Jeff Garzik pointed out that each new soft-forked feature of Bitcoin leans heavily on miner trust rather than P2P network validation. He argued that the core design of Bitcoin is for trustless nodes to validate the work of miners, not to trust them. Soft forks move in the opposite direction, degrading the security of non-upgraded nodes and making them more reliant on miner trust. Another member of the discussion, jl2012, argued that having more nodes to fully validate non-soft-forked transactions won't make them any safer. They used the example of CLTV transactions, which are just as secure as non-CLTV transactions despite only about one-third of nodes supporting BIP65 at the time. The original poster asked why this should be an issue when there are good signaling mechanisms and activation warning systems for non-upgraded nodes, such as BIP9 or block version ISM.</p>
