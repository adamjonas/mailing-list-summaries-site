    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Justus Ranvier proposed that the segwit merkle root should not be put in the coinbase of a soft fork. Instead, he suggested that it should be placed in the first output of the generation transaction as an OP_RETURN script. He argued that this was a better pattern because coinbase space is limited while output space is not. In response to another participant's comment that data doesn't belong in the coinbase and that it is meant for miners, not developers, Ranvier stated that he believed a hard fork would be better for SegWit as it reduces the size of fraud proofs considerably, makes the whole design more elegant and less kludgey, and is safer for clients who do not upgrade in a timely fashion.</p>
