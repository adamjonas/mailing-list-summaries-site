    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell proposed working towards a segwit soft-fork which would increase capacity and scalability, and reduce bandwidth/storage. He suggested that recent speedups and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk, and that it would also make further improvements easier and faster to deploy. This plan would allow progress to be made without being forced to make a potentially divisive choice for one hardfork or another yet. The proposal received support from other members of the community, including Pieter Wuille and Wladimir J. van der Laan. They noted that the plan would provide a short-term capacity bump, show the world that scalability is being worked on, solve several unrelated problems at the same time (fraud proofs, script extensibility, malleability, etc.), and improve scalability in the long term by indirectly improving the effectiveness of systems like Lightning. The next step for segwit is a BIP and deployment on a testnet.</p>
