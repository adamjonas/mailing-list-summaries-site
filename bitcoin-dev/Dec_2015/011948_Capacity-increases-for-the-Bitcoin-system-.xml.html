    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen has suggested that deploying SegWit via a hard fork could be a cleaner and safer option compared to a soft fork. Andresen's argument is based on the fact that if SegWit is deployed through a soft fork, SPV wallet servers will need to change their logic in order to maintain compatibility. If they don't change their logic, they may not be able to send payments. According to Andresen, if SegWit is implemented via a hard fork, it would avoid these issues and ensure a better user experience. In response to this, Jorge Timon shared his design of hashRootStruct which doesn't calculate other_root, as it is not necessary for maintaining compatibility with SPV nodes/wallets. Andresen also commented on the fact that keeping the merkle tree structure binary would make more sense than having a three-headed tree.</p>
