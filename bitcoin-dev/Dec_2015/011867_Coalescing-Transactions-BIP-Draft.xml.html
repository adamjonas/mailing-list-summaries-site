    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author made a post regarding the implementation of "coalescing transactions" using an opcode, however, they now believe that a new "transaction type" field would be a better approach. The new type field could have various uses, with wildcard inputs being the first. One issue that needs to be resolved is limiting the number of inputs included in the coalesce to prevent nodes from taking too long to count them all. A solution proposed is to limit wildcard inputs to 10,000 items, and if there are more inputs, they must be coalesced in chunks. The other issue is limiting wildcard inputs to only confirmed inputs older than a certain block age to avoid potential problems caused by re-orgs. A draft can be found on Github.</p>
