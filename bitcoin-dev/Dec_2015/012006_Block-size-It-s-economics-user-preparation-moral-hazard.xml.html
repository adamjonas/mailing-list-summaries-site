    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Pieter Wuille discussed the fact that there is no one group in charge of making decisions regarding changes to the cryptocurrency. Rather, there are various groups with differing levels of power and organization, including Core Devs, miners, exchanges, merchants, and customers, each with their own interests and potential for influence. While consensus is important, it is not always necessary for changes to be made, and if merchants and customers were to switch to different software, they could have a significant impact on the process. Ultimately, the core devs have been given authority to make decisions by the most powerful groups, but they do not have carte blanche and can be checked if necessary.</p>
