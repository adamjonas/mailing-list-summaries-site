    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Chris Priest claimed that block withholding attacks are only possible if the attacker has a majority of hashpower. However, another user disputed this claim, stating that an attacker with as little as 0.5% of the hash rate could sabotage 10% of a pool's income. This would be enough to kill the pool. Despite these differing opinions, it was noted that the attack is still largely theoretical, as those with the majority of hashpower have not engaged in this behavior yet. The issue was deemed a low priority, and there are more pressing matters to work on in the meantime.</p>
