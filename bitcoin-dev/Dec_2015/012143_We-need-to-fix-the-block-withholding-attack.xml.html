    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd raised concerns about network propagation effects between large and small miners. He stated that in an environment where selfish mining is possible, the difference in profitability between small and large miners can be a worrying problem. The issue is exacerbated if the network topology is flat and easily susceptible to DoS/sybil attacks. However, if the block size is small enough that propagation time is negligible to profitability, then selfish mining attacks with hashing power are not much of a concern, as they'll be naturally defeated by anti-DoS/anti-sybil measures. The conversation then turned to factors affecting mining profitability, with one participant suggesting that sufficient network bandwidth is a more broadly available commodity than electricity contracts or vertically integrated chip manufacturers.</p>
