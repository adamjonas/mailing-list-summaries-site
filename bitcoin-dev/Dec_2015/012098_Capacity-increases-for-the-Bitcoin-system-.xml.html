    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 21, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding implementing a plan for segregated witness (segwit). Pieter Wuille proposed that the community work towards this plan as it would allow progress without being forced to make a potentially divisive choice for one hardfork or another. Btc Drak agreed, stating that the plan is solid and delivers multiple benefits without being contentious. The proposed features were listed, including libsecp256k1, versionbits, segregated witness, IBLT, weak blocks, and OP_CSV, all of which have been demonstrated as significant improvements that are implementable and do not introduce any new attacks or risks. The next step for segwit was discussed, with the suggestion being a BIP and deployment on a testnet. However, there were some proposed features missing from Pieter's segwit branch, and it was suggested that patches for them would be appreciated. One such missing feature was enforcing the proposed base+witness/4.</p>
