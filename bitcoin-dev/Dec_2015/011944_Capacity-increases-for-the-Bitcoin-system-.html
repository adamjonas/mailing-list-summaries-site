    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen proposed designing a merkle tree for future uses of the blockchain. In response to Gregory Maxwell's suggestion that it should be part of a hardfork, Andresen suggested that it would be sufficient to design ahead for future uses of the merkle tree. He proposed a structure of the merkle tree with the root in block header and branches for tx data, other data, segwitness data, and reserved for future use data. Andresen also mentioned the possibility of moving commitments to additional block back-references for compact SPV proofs and UTXO set commitments as part of a hardfork. While there was concern about additional overhead for these applications, Andresen argued that an extensible format via softfork in the future would be sufficient. He ultimately advocated for deploying segregated witness as a hardfork with a relatively small change required for its implementation and suggested deploying both segregated witness and movement from the coinbase to the extra header at the same time with different activation conditions.</p>
