    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 21, 2015, jl2012 raised concerns about SW in P2SH. The issue with it was that it required an additional push in scriptSig which is not prunable in transmission and is counted as part of the core block size. There was confusion regarding the term "prunable in transmission," which meant that it had to be included when not sending the witnesses. However, this caused a name collision with UTXO set prunable. Initially, there was some misunderstanding about scriptSigs being prunable, but it is actually scriptPubKeys that have to be held in the UTXO database.</p>
