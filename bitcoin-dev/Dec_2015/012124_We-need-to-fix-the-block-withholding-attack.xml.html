    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation among Bitcoin developers on December 26, 2015, Eric Lombrozo clarified that they were assuming the actual total hashrate would remain constant. This statement was made in response to confusion about the assumption that the total reward per unit of time would drop. The discussion focused on the potential impact of a decrease in block rewards on the overall hashrate and security of the Bitcoin network. While some argued that decreasing rewards could lead to a decrease in miner participation and ultimately compromise the network's security, others maintained that the market would adjust and that the network would remain secure.</p>
