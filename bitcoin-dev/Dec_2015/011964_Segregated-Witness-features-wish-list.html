    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, proposed that any scriptPubKey (or redeemscript) that consists of a single push is a witness program. He suggested that any script that fails or results in anything other than a single TRUE on the stack should not be allowed to prevent stuffing the witness with useless data during relay of transactions. Wuille also suggests allowing traditional transactions to have data in the witness field for any potential softfork upgrade. In response to another user's comment, Wuille agrees that it is useful to allow segwit inside P2SH and provides an equivalent list reflecting how his current prototype works. The most significant byte of serialized script is the version byte, an unsigned number. If the version byte is 0x00, the script must fail. If the version byte is 0x02 to 0xff, the rest of the serialized script is ignored and the output is spendable with any form of witness.</p>
