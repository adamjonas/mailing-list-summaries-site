    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jonathan Toomim suggests making it explicit to rely on the trustworthiness of miners during soft forks. This is because they have been relied upon in the past and only failed once. The message was sent on Dec 30, 2015 at 3:49 PM and was followed by an HTML attachment which was scrubbed. There was also a non-text attachment named 'signature.asc' which was a PGP signature with a size of 496 bytes.</p>
