    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposes two solutions for the ongoing debate about the scaling of Bitcoin's block size. The first proposal is a combination of fast BIP102 and slow SWSF, while the second proposal is only fast SWSF. The author believes that everyone wants to do segwit but argues that it is too complicated and may not be the best short-term solution. They also disagree with the idea that BIP102 is inferior to segwit as they believe that BIP102 is simple and has been successful in the past. Mark Friedenbach provides several reasons why segwit is a better option than simply adjusting the block size to 2MB, including the limitation of non-witness data to no more than 1MB and more accurate cost accounting for redeem scripts in witness use. Segwit also provides features, such as opt-in malleability protection, which are required by higher-level scaling solutions.</p>
