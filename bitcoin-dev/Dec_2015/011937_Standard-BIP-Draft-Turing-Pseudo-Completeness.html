    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tomorrow, the writer plans to work on developing a system for using BTC as voting shares. Though they do not know FORTH, they believe it will be a useful and simple example requiring loops and reused functions. They intend to add a fee that goes to the creator of the system. The writer believes it makes sense to charge a fee for complex systems that are used frequently. For instance, a decentralized exchange between colored coins might take a small fee on each trade. In response to an email from Luke Durback via bitcoin-dev, the writer was asked to provide high-level examples of the use cases they would like to support with this system.</p>
