    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The SW payment address format BIP has been rewritten, with two types of new addresses introduced. This is the third BIP for SegWit, with a second one for Peer Services being prepared by Eric Lombrozo. The BIP draft is ready and pending BIP number assignment. Eric Lombrozo has been working with jl2012 on some SEGWIT BIPs based on earlier discussions of Pieter Wuille's implementation. They are considering submitting three separate BIPs: - Consensus BIP- Peer Services BIP- Applications BIPThe Consensus BIP is submitted as a draft and is pending BIP number assignment, whereas the other two BIPs will be drafted soon. The Consensus BIP includes witness structures and how they're committed to blocks, cost metrics and limits, the scripting system (witness programs), and the soft fork mechanism. On the other hand, the Peer Services BIP includes relay message structures, witnesstx serialization, and other issues pertaining to the P2P protocol such as IBD, synchronization, tx and block propagation, etc... Lastly, the Applications BIP includes scriptPubKey encoding formats and other wallet interoperability concerns.</p>
