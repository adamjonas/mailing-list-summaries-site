    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This email conversation discusses various techniques to detect block withholding attacks, with some methods being kept secret by those who know about them. The use of KYC is mentioned as a potential solution but is deemed unlikely to be effective due to the unlikelihood of all pools implementing identity checking. DRM technology is also discussed as a means of attestation to ensure nodes are running the correct code and not misbehaving. The conversation also highlights the dangers of large open pools and the benefits of small, decentralized pools. A specific suggestion involving the Bitcoin PoW is mentioned but is considered a bad idea due to the potential for a GHash-at-51% situation to arise again.</p>
