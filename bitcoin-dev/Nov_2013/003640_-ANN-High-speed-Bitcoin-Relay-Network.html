    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message explains how to peer with the public relay nodes. Users can select the closest region out of us-west, us-east, eu, au, or jpy and add public.REGION.relay.mattcorallo.com to their addnode list. It is important to note that all relay nodes will relay between each other, so there is no latency advantage by peering with more than the closest node. For each relay node, users can connect to either port 8334 or 8335. Connecting on port 8334 will relay only blocks, while port 8335 will relay both blocks and transactions. To prevent DoS attacks by flooding transactions, it is suggested to split the block-only and block+tx not only by port number but also by DNS address. This ensures that in the event of an attack, the more important block relaying functionality is less likely to be damaged. In the meantime, both DNS addresses should point to the same IP until it becomes an issue. The message is signed with GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux) and SHA256 hash.</p>
