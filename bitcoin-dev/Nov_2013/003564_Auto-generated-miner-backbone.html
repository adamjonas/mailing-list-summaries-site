    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Alan Reiner and Peter Todd discuss the possibility of a miner monopolizing good connections to gain an advantage in the mining process. They both agree that low-latency and good visibility to the network are crucial for winning orphan rates, but it comes at a high cost. They suggest randomizing the order of broadcasts to de-incentivize such behavior. However, they also acknowledge that most solutions tend to be economically irrational or even incentivize mining pools to become larger. Overall, they conclude that if there is a single selfish-miner amongst a network of honest miners, the honest miners can establish connections to each other and eventually orphan away the selfish-miner's profit.</p>
