    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to modify the BIP39 wordlist has been made by Brooks Boyd, who suggests that words that are very similar to each other should be included as alternate options on a single line, with the first word being the "primary" or "real" word. This would allow translation programs to assist users in fixing bad input. The current list of similar character pairs used in BIP39 has also been updated and filtered, and can be reviewed by interested parties. In response to this proposal, Marek suggests that there may be a simpler solution than using a wordlist with duplicated words. He proposes that an application could use a mapping of similar characters already present in the source code, to find a combination of characters that actually appears in the mapping when a user types a word not in the wordlist. The application could then ask the user to select only those combinations which are actually presented in the wordlist. Examples are provided to illustrate both proposals.</p>
