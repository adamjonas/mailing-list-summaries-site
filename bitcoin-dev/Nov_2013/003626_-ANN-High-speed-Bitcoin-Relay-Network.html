    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>From the given context, it seems that the code is looking very reasonable and one can replace any verbose construct with Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS). To make this concept work efficiently, a website would be required along with marketing assistance. The pool operators will not reach out on their own. The existing network's connectivity can also be boosted with bitcoind changes to make it more elegant. In response to Tier Nolan's query, Matt Corallo explains that no, the transactions relayed are piped through a bitcoind first and fully verified by a bitcoind. For blocks, bitcoinj does SPV-validation. Although it is possible to create a block that passes SPV validation but causes a DoS score, doing so would cost a miner a full block's worth of profits which they are unlikely to do. If it ever becomes a problem, one can always adapt addnode to allow higher DoS scores for individual nodes. Tier Nolan suggests assigning another bit in the services field as "relay" which means that the node doesn't do any checking. Connects to relay nodes could be command line/config file only. Peers wouldn't connect to them.</p>
