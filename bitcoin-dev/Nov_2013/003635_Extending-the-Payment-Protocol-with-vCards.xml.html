    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Taylor Gerring and Mike Hearn, discussion was had around payment protocol extensions. While Gerring proposed the idea of vCard support as a way to increase usability and improve user experience in wallets supporting Payment Protocol (PP), Hearn expressed skepticism about the usefulness of vCards and instead suggested social network integration as a better alternative. According to Hearn, social network integration is more favorable because it utilizes the ID's people already have, and major social networks all have a concept of a user ID that can be queried without any kind of API authorization for basic info. He suggests embedding a social network URL into a payment request to associate a name/photo with a payment. Authentication may not be necessary, but if it were, steganographically embedding a key into the profile picture and signing the payment request with it would be one way to do so. Overall, Hearn encourages experimentation and prototyping of different extension ideas.</p>
