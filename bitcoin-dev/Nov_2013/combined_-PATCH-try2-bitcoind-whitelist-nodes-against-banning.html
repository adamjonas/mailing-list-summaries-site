        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In November 2013, Jeff Garzik proposed the idea of whitelisting nodes on the Bitcoin network to prevent them from being banned. This was in response to concerns about a high number of bans occurring on the network. It is unclear whether or not this suggestion was implemented or further discussed. In an email exchange on November 22, 2013, Gregory Maxwell asked Garzik why Bitcoin Core did not have a parallel get RPC to obtain the current list. Garzik replied that it would be easy to add and mentioned requests for an IP blacklist, which would require associated RPC/config gadgetry. Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist affiliated with BitPay, Inc., added a whitelist feature to the bitcoin client software in 2013, allowing for whitelisted nodes to be protected from being banned. This can be done through an entry point via RPC, configuration file, or command line. The feature is implemented in the net.cpp file of the Bitcoin Core codebase, where the AddWhitelist() function is defined. The IsWhitelisted() function checks whether a given address is potentially local, and LoadWhitelist() loads any addresses specified in the -whitelist parameter. On Github, there is a pull request for a bannode RPC, but the function does not seem to be working at this time. Maxwell suggested having a parallel get RPC to obtain the current list, to which Garzik agreed it would be easy to add. In addition, there were requests for an IP blacklist, which would require associated RPC/config gadgetry. The email thread also included an advertisement for Intel's Software Adrenaline, promoting strategic insight and conversations shaping the mobile landscape. This email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list managed by SourceForge.</p>
