    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Alessandro Parisi and Jeff Garzik, it was noted that if a bug were to be found in the Bitcoin protocol, fixing it could take a significant amount of time. This is due to the potential for a fix to create other problems, which could have disastrous consequences. It was even suggested that a major mistake could instantly destroy over $2 billion worth of value. Jeff Garzik is a Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. - a company in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
