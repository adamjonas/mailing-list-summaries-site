    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 21, 2013, Mike Hearn added some additional logging to his node and ran it for a few days. He found that despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, virtually all transactions seen by his node were being announced by modified software running on several different machines. Hearn was wondering if anyone out there knows or owns these nodes, and if they are relaying transactions without checking their validity, which seems the most likely reason why they always win the race to be the first to announce to his node. In response, Jeff Garzik questioned whether the relay in question was Matt's and had reduced validity checking. The email exchange ends with an advertisement for Intel(R) Software Adrenaline and a link to sign up for it.</p>
