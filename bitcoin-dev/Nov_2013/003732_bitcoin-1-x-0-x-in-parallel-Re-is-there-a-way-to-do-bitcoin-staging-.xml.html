    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about a new digital scarcity on an alpha-qa level network, and how it is similar to a slightly stabler version of test-net. The idea is to develop bitcoin 1.x in parallel with bitcoin 0.x, which would allow for the testing of new features and disabled scripts before being deployed onto 1.x. However, this introduces non-zero risk, hence the 1 way peg idea. The discussion also raises concerns about whether there are enough people with the skills and motivation to support two parallel efforts. Melvin proposes creating a new genesis block for a staging network that keeps the properties of bitcoin as far as possible. Staging coins can be traded, but people should be aware that changes can be rolled into the network without warning. A straw poll voting system could be set up for those who own staging coins to sign messages saying which patches they would like to test out next. When patches are stable in the staging area, they could be promoted to the main net.</p>
