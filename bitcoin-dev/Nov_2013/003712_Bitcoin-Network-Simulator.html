    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has created a Bitcoin network simulator that is a stochastic event-based continuous-time simulation of Bitcoin miners exchanging messages and building block chains. The simulator includes two examples, one for a 51% attack and the other is an implementation of selfish mining. It simulates latency, bandwidth and verification speed but currently does not simulate propagation or inclusion of transactions, instead using random block sizes. The project can be found on the developer's Github page. Another developer has also created a Bitcoin network simulator with similar basic principles, which follows the protocol message structure as much as possible. The ultimate goal is to have a network/chain visualization running in the browser with the actual simulation running on a WebWorker to keep things responsive. The second simulator runs a network of 1000 full nodes (with 100 miners) for a week of simulated time (with a normal hashrate) and empty blocks (except for the coinbase transaction) takes about 30-60 seconds, using nodejs. Theoretical support for transaction propagation is included in this simulator, with the aim of testing zero-conf stuff and whether it works.</p>
