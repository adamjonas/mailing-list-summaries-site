    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development discussion, Mike Hearn suggested that once the ASIC race calms down and everyone has optimal power supplies, process improvements become unreachable, people will stop using large pools because reducing their fees will be the next logical step to squeeze out extra profits. Peter Todd responded that a few months ago, ASICMiner could have utilized the "selfish miner" attack which would have been profitable but development costs would have eaten into profits. Todd also pointed out that GHash.IO had 22% of the total hashing power and lowered the barrier with reactive block publishing (a better name), so they could potentially fix any shortfall, and/or lower the barrier with reactive block publishing.</p>
