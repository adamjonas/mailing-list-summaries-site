    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a technical discussion on Thursday, November 14, 2013, Mark Friedenbach proposed the use of "key id" instead of "hashed-pubkeys" to avoid confusion with the term "address." He argued that calling hashed-pubkeys "addresses" could mislead people into associating them with physical addresses or accounts, which rarely change. Such associations would defeat the security and privacy guarantees of the system when key pairs are reused. Friedenbach suggested using terminology that leads people to think of ephemeral, temporary use. However, Luke pointed out that keys are often reused, making "key id" less effective in conveying single-use. Instead, he suggested using "invoice id" as an alternative because it conveys the importance of not paying the same invoice twice.</p>
