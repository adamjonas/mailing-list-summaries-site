    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin terminology, Drak suggests using "confirmations" instead of "blocks" but Luke argues that it may not be helpful for the average person as it may mean something different. Instead, he proposes to use "witnessed N times" if not referring to blocks. He also suggests using "payment address" or "bitcoin address" instead of simply "address" to avoid confusion with email addresses. However, Luke cautions against using "invoice id" as it is just a reference for payment and not the destination. While Drak suggests using "bitcoin id" or "bitcoin address", Luke points out that Bitcoin addresses are not like email addresses or PayPal ids as they represent information such as who is paying and what for - in other words, a specific invoice.</p>
