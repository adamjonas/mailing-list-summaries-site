    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown recipient, Todd proposed a mechanism for wallets to get non-sybilled peers, which would discourage pools from only connecting to other pools, thereby preventing centralization. The proposal suggested defining a standard in the coinbase that commits to extra data appended to the block message and stored temporarily in the block database for a few months before being erased. This semi-transient data would not be part of the chain but could be extended as needed with new "getextra" messages allowing nodes to query for it. The hash can be short since it doesn't have to survive brute force attacks longer than the validity period of the transient data, so 80 bits would probably be overkill.</p>
