        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2013, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, submitted a patch for discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. Due to temporary Github access disablement, he chose this avenue to submit the patch. However, another member of the mailing list named Michael noticed that the code in the patch resembled node.js code for a tool called txtool. The purpose of the patch and whether it was accepted and implemented into the Bitcoin codebase remains unclear.Jeff Garzik, aside from being a Bitcoin core developer, also worked for BitPay, Inc., an open-source payment processor for Bitcoin. In the email containing the patch, Garzik included a promotional message for Intel's Software Adrenaline. This promotion offered a free subscription for software experts and developers to stay updated on tech innovation.The patch submitted by Garzik adds functions to the BitcoinRPC.js file, including getRawTransaction, signRawTransaction, and sendRawTransaction. Additionally, a new transaction tool has been introduced, allowing users to load files in hex format, serialize transactions from bitcoind RPC, and execute JSON-RPC commands using the txtool command. Users can run the tool by executing `./txtool -h` and following the provided instructions.</p>
