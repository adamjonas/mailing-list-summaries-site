    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from November 19, 2013, Drak made a comment about the allocation of numbers for drafts in standards bodies. He explained that if the drafts do not pass, they are clearly labeled as such. Drak also expressed support for having work in a GitHub repository for better collaboration. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) distinguishes between individual proposals and accepted documents by working groups. Work is not assigned a number until it is complete. It is important to distinguish completed work that people should be implementing from incomplete work and the work of single parties. This is to prevent confusion and misunderstandings like the proposal to increase the supply of Bitcoins to 210 million being mistaken as an earnest proposal supported by many with traction.</p>
