    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas M. Antonopoulos, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, shared a report by Nicholas Weaver indicating that pools have been delaying blocks since Nov. 3rd. This delay hints at Selfish Mining tactics being implemented by the pools. Antonopoulos questions whether this report is accurate or if there is another issue in the network causing these delays.To address the issue of delayed block propagation, Antonopoulos points out that BC.i timestamps have historically been inaccurate compared to local GPS clock measurements on his own nodes. Additionally, Weaver's comparison of block timestamps and BC.i numbers is flawed because it doesn't account for the time it takes to compute work, send it to the miner, search for a valid nonce, and return a result. Antonopoulos argues that evidence of selfish miners wouldn't be found in block timestamps or data on blockchain.info, but rather through an unusual amount of orphan blocks. High levels of orphaned blocks are necessary evidence of selfish mining tactics, as they couldn't be faked.</p>
