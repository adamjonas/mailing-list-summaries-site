    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post discusses the need for a configurable millisecond tick and accurate flow of information that does not necessarily require emulation of the whole protocol or simulation of every network message. The author is interested in analyzing how often miners win when holding their block until they see another one in the current situation and how it changes with various numbers of remote sensors. The author also mentions that future applications could involve transaction spread, double spends, network partitions, and transaction replacement, among others. For any simulation run involving blocks, realistic latencies for blocks are required, and if it involves transactions, the latencies should be realistic as well. The author offers to contribute 1 BTC for an instrumentation package for the reference client that would collect data for the simulator. Finally, a list of experiments that could be conducted on the proposed model is mentioned.</p>
