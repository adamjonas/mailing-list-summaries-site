    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Jeremy Spilman expressed concern that even with good connectivity, the 'y' factor cannot be zero. He referred to a paper on the effect a single node can have on propagation and block size's relation with propagation speed. He then proposed a solution to force selfish miners to disclose their blocks: propagate and relay an encrypted block header that honest miners timestamp when they receive it, then propagate the decryption key 10 seconds later. However, Ittay Eyal warned that this solution could open doors to DoS attacks and make simple algorithms complicated. He also noted that making such changes may lead to different vulnerabilities that are difficult to cover.</p>
