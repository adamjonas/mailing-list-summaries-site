    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, Christian Decker posted his measurement code from the Information Propagation paper and automated it to correlate propagation information against block characteristics. Gregory Maxwell requested that Decker publish the block ids and timestamp sets for each block to further analyze the data. However, Decker expressed concern about serving large files due to website capacity limitations but offered to provide the information on a per user basis if demand is not significant. Michael also contributed to the conversation, suggesting normalizing results with block size and finding correlations with transaction sizes. The group discussed defining a standard block size of 200kb or similar to compare plots between days. They also mentioned using the number of inputs as a more interesting measure than kilobytes, although there may be some correlation with size. Finally, they considered the possibility of finding a way to publish the measurements in a manageable manner.</p>
