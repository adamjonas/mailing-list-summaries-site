    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email dated November 22, 2013, Jeff Garzik proposed whitelisting nodes against banning. The proposal was made on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, which is hosted by SourceForge. The email also included a link to Intel(R) Software Adrenaline, which offers free subscriptions to software experts and developers who want to stay at the forefront of tech innovation. The purpose of the email was to generate discussion among members of the Bitcoin-development community about how best to shape the rapidly evolving mobile landscape. A response to Garzik's proposal thanked him for his contribution and promised to run the patches on some nodes the following day to test their effectiveness.</p>
