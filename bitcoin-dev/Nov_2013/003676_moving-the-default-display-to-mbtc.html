    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion dated November 14, 2013, Alan Reiner expressed his liking for the XBT idea, which aimed to match the ISO currency symbol. However, he suggested that SI prefixes should be used instead of 'micro bitcoins' and proposed calling them "microbes," although he acknowledged that it might not be the right term for money transfer. He also suggested using "bits" or "microbits" as an alternative. The display units were supposed to be selectable by the user. Alan emphasized the importance of promoting a consistent term to prevent confusion when people use different names for the new unit. However, another participant in the discussion disagreed with the XBT concept and argued that the reason SI prefixes were invented was to avoid such cases.</p>
