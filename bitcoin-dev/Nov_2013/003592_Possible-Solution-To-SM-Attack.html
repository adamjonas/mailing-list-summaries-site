    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The scenario presented involves Alice and Bob mining on different blocks but Alice secretly mining on A2 while withholding the information from other miners. Bob broadcasts his block, assuming that Alice will send her previously mined block (A1) to all other miners. However, by the time Bob's block reaches other miners, most of them have already received Block A1, making Bob's block likely to be orphaned. Alice gains an advantage by mining longer on a valid block. To make this attack work, she waits until another miner finds a block before releasing her previously mined block. A potential solution is to take into account either the total transactions or fees for block acceptance. It is not yet clear whether there is really a problem that needs fixing.</p>
