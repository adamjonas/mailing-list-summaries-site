        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In November 2013, an email conversation among Bitcoin developers discussed the possibility of a selfish mining attack by large pools on the main network. Gavin Andresen expressed concern about this and warned that if he found out about such an experiment, he would encourage people to switch to a more responsible pool. He suggested that lowering the barrier with reactive block publishing could make it easier for a pool to reach 51% hashing power. Peter Todd jokingly called for a witch hunt against large pools. Kyle Jerviss explained in another email thread that the longer a miner delays publishing a block in Bitcoin mining, the more the expected reward drops due to orphaned blocks.However, the response to this email criticized the lack of stated assumptions in a paper and noted that attacking a paper can involve showing it's wrong or showing its assumptions make it irrelevant. Mike Hearn suggested that once the ASIC race calms down, people will dissipate from large pools to eliminate their fees for extra profit. He also stated that a few hundred pools or many miners on p2pool would make many of these theoretical attacks not very relevant.In another email thread, kjj offered a bounty of 1 BTC for building a general Bitcoin network simulator framework that can account for latency between nodes, simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network, and be easily modified for other schemes. This was in response to the lack of a suitable network simulator which allowed the Selfish Mining paper to gain attention. The author of a post on bitcointalk.org also criticized the Selfish Mining paper for not being a suitable simulation of the Bitcoin network due to its lack of latency and states. They suggested that a general Bitcoin network simulator framework is needed that can account for latency between nodes, simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network, and be easily modified for other schemes.Peter Todd discussed his miner strategy of sending blocks to only 51% of the hashpower and the implications of this strategy in a Bitcoin-development mailing list discussion. He calculated that the actual threshold is 29.3% and explained that once a miner has more than 29.3% of the hashing power, they have no incentive to publish the blocks they mine. Todd also noted that if a miner is trying to beat other miners, then sending blocks to >29.3% of the hashing power is even more crazy. Additionally, Todd pointed out that the strategy does not require a special low-latency network or a lot of hashing power, as the strategy still works if a miner is, say, a 5% pool. He concluded that "we're fucked" and that the awful incentive structure must be fixed before the inflation subsidy gets any smaller.The post discusses the need for a configurable millisecond tick and accurate flow of information that does not necessarily require emulation of the whole protocol or simulation of every network message. The author is interested in analyzing how often miners win when holding their block until they see another one in the current situation and how it changes with various numbers of remote sensors. The author also mentions that future applications could involve transaction spread, double spends, network partitioning, and transaction replacement. The author offers to contribute 1 BTC for an instrumentation package for the reference client that would collect data for the simulator. Finally, a list of experiments that could be conducted on the proposed model is mentioned.The context involves a discussion about building a simulation of the Bitcoin network for educational purposes. The author of an email criticizes academics for not being helpful to society and offers a bounty of 1 BTC for building a general bitcoin network simulator framework. The simulator should be able to account for latency between nodes and simulate an attacker who owns varying fractions of the network. The email also discusses the correct strategy for a miner to get more blocks than their competition, where the suggested strategy is to withhold the block to increase expected revenue.Gavin Andresen warns large mining pools to not run experiments on the main network that could increase everyone's orphan rate and encourages miners to switch to smaller pools or p2pool if they are mining on a pool with over 1% hashing power. Bitcoin mining involves solving blocks for rewards, but delays in publishing blocks can result in a drop in expected reward or even no reward at all. To be effective, miners must consider the value of unpublished blocks and when to publish them. While this is mostly theoretical due to the large inflation subsidy and unimportant fees, it could become more complex in the future. Peter Todd has been contacted by pools as a way to encourage large pool miners to switch to smaller ones. If everyone mined solo or on p2pool, these issues would not matter much.</p>
