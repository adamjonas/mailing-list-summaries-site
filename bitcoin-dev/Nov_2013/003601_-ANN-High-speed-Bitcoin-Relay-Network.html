    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, has announced plans to create a system of high-speed relay nodes for miners and merchants/exchanges. The system aims to decrease block propagation times between miners and act as a fallback mechanism in the case that the public Bitcoin network encounters issues. The system is open to everyone via a few public relay nodes but will also have nodes which are made available only to large miners and merchants/exchanges to mitigate the ability of malicious parties to DoS the network. To peer with the public relay nodes, users can select the closest region out of five options and add public.REGION.relay.mattcorallo.com to their addnode list. The relay nodes do some data verification to prevent DoS but in order to keep relay fast, they do not fully verify the data they are relaying. Therefore, they are not designed to ensure that users never miss data, and may fail to relay some transactions. Additionally, because the relay nodes do not respond to standard getdata requests, if a user misses a relay and then reconnects, that data will not be sent again by the relay nodes. The relay nodes are not a replacement for having peers on the standard P2P network, they are only there to augment the existing P2P network.</p>
