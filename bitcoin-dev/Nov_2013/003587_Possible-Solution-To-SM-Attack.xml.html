    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Quinn Harris criticized the idea of choosing the block with the lowest hash as the best option in blockchain. The reason cited was that both good and bad miners have an equal probability of finding a lower hash. However, after Alice finds a block, she can easily determine the probability of someone else finding a lower value hash that meets the difficulty requirement. This information can be used to judge if it's best to start working on the next block or work on finding a lower value hash to increase the chance her block is used. To make the process unpredictable, Drak suggested adding another factor by deciding the rules of whether higher or lower wins by hashing both competing blockhashes. If the leading two hex digits are below 128, lower wins, and if above, higher wins.</p>
