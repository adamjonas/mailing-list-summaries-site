    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion regarding Bitcoin transaction replacement, Adam Back suggests that making everything the same except for the amount going to one address would be simpler and more robust. However, he acknowledges the privacy leak that this method may cause. He also notes that change addresses do not add much privacy according to network analysis. In terms of privacy fixes, Back believes that more robust solutions are needed in addition to revising fees. The use of transaction replacement has been found to extend beyond modifying fees. Allowing for the value of a designated change address to be changed after the fact is not compatible with current zero-conf-using implementations, as it could potentially allow for a zeroconf attack. Despite this, the code for implementing replacement is already simple and does not need to be made less general. Transaction relaying rules are not part of consensus.</p>
