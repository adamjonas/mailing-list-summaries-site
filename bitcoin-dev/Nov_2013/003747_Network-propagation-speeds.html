    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Decker responded to Michael Gronager's idea of extending the calculations to include a size-normalized version. Christian also suggested that with enough samples, some of the system parameters might be reconstructed. Michael recommended normalizing the results with block size and plotting the delay graph either by normalizing it to the averaged block size or defining a "standard block size" of 200kb. He also proposed to find the logical t0 and the constant for the correlation of propagation times and transaction sizes. Gregory Maxwell requested Christian to publish the block ids and timestamp sets for each block as it would be useful in correlating propagation information against block characteristics. In addition, Christian is looking for a good way to publish the measurements but hadn't found a good option yet. However, he suggested providing them on a per user basis if the demand is not huge.</p>
