    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Wladimir on October 21, 2013, Jeff asked if they were going to move ahead with the BIP drafts, which are stored in git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/ and are not automatically assigned a BIPS number. Wladimir responded that he thought it was useful to have a number as soon as a BIP could be implemented, even if still in draft status. He further added that it gives something to refer to when mentioning a certain improvement proposal. Additionally, he stated that he did not think they were at risk of running out of numbers to assign any time soon. As software for BIP drafts is developed, tested, published, and publicly discussed in a typical open source manner, Wladimir volunteered to create the repository and import the current BIPs from the wiki there (and convert from wiki markup to markdown where necessary).</p>
