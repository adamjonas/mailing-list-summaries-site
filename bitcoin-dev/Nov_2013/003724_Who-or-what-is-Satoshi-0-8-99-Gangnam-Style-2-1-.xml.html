    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author added some additional logging to their node and ran it for a few days. There is a pull request open for the extra logging. The author is concerned because virtually all transactions seen by their node are being announced by modified software that appears to run on several different machines. Despite having 87 connections from regular nodes, this modified software always wins the race to be the first to announce to the author's node. The author wonders if anyone knows/owns these nodes and if they are relaying transactions without checking their validity, which seems like the most likely reason for their success.</p>
