    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on 11/08/13, Mike Hearn suggested a more concise way to replace verbose code. Matt confirmed that he had made the necessary changes. Mike also mentioned that for the concept of Matt's blockchain project to take off, he would need to recruit someone to help market it as pool operators wouldn't reach out to him. Matt responded by saying he had already done some outreach and was planning another round. Mike suggested boosting the connectivity of the existing network with bitcoind changes but agreed that improving relay times across the regular P2P network would be nice. Matt clarified that his project was not a part of the P2P network but rather a backup relay network that followed the P2P protocol. He hoped to find more ways to relay blocks, such as launching a satellite.</p>
