    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Github, there is a pull request for a bannode RPC, although the function does not seem to be working at this time. In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Gregory Maxwell, Maxwell suggests having a parallel get RPC to obtain the current list, to which Garzik agrees it would be easy to add. Additionally, there have been requests for an IP blacklist, which would require associated RPC/config gadgetry. Garzik identifies as a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist affiliated with BitPay, Inc. The email thread also includes an advertisement for Intel's Software Adrenaline, promoting strategic insight and conversations shaping the mobile landscape. This email was sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list managed by SourceForge.</p>
