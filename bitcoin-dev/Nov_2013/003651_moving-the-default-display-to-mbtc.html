    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the base unit of Bitcoin and whether to skip mBTC and move straight to uBTC, which uses only two decimal places. The argument in favor of uBTC is that it is more intuitive for the average user, as new national currencies are also using two decimal places as a standard. It would also align with Satoshi's decimal units, making something that costs $10USD equal to 25000uBTC. However, there are concerns that this change could cause confusion and lead to mistakes resulting in lost coins. Additionally, some people may perceive uBTC as worthless and not divisible enough. Alan's ideas for compatibility with multiple fields are seen as helpful in resolving any confusion related to this issue.</p>
