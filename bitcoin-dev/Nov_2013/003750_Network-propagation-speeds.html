    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Decker is currently working on adding real-time stats to the webpage, and he needs to find the time to implement access to the collector. He received a request from Mike Hearn to sort the snapshots by date, which Christian Decker agreed to do. In response to Michael Gronager's suggestion to normalize the results with block size, Christian Decker stated that he will extend the calculations to include a size-normalized version. He also mentioned that given enough samples, they may be able to reconstruct some of the system parameters and attempted to correlate propagation speed and number of inputs/outputs. Gregory Maxwell requested Christian Decker to publish the block ids and timestamp sets for each block. To this, Christian Decker said that he's looking for a good way to publish these measurements as they are rather large in size.</p>
