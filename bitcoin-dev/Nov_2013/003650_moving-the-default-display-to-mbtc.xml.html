    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread posted on the Bitcoin mailing list, Mark Friedenbach argued in favor of skipping mBTC and moving straight to uBTC. Friedenbach believes that having eight or even five decimal places is not intuitive for the average user, and thinks it would be better if bitcoin moved to two decimal places such as most national currencies. He estimates that 25.00uBTC is currently equal to $0.01. Friedenbach believes that going through a confusing renumbering process to switch from mBTC to uBTC would only cause more heartache than it's worth. Another member of the mailing list, Alan Reiner, disagreed with Friedenbach, stating that it's hard to change the base unit in such an established system and that there is no easy way to do this without causing more problems. While there is no clear consensus on the issue, the discussion highlights the ongoing attempt to make Bitcoin more user-friendly and accessible to the general public.</p>
