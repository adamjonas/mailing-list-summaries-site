    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 19th, 2013, Wladimir enquired about moving forward with storing Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) drafts on a Github repository and assigning them numbers. Jeff Garzik responded that the current BIP drafts were stored in `git://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git/drafts/` and not automatically assigned a BIP number. Wladimir volunteered to create the repository and import current BIPs from the wiki there and convert them from wiki markup to markdown where necessary. A few months later, Drak supported assigning numbers to BIP drafts as soon as possible to give something to refer to when mentioning a certain improvement proposal. He believed it was normal for standards bodies to allocate numbers in draft status, and if they didnâ€™t pass, they are clearly labeled drafts. Drak also agreed that using Github for collaboration was much better.</p>
