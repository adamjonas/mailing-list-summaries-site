    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about changing Bitcoin's protocol, Mike Hearn disagreed with a suggestion that anyone could broadcast a newly discovered block at any point and have a 50% chance of being the winner. He argued that it would fundamentally change how Bitcoin works and require careful thought and study. Peter Todd chimed in, saying that the proposal follows the same logic as his previous post on "near-block broadcasts," which he believes naturally leads to the proposed solution. Todd also discussed his idea that if there is no explicit block size limit, miners have incentives to make their blocks large enough that they only propagate to just over 50% of the hashing power, thus causing their competitors to waste effort.</p>
