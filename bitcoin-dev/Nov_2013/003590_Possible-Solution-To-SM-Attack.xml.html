    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen has expressed his desire to be convinced that a real-world problem exists before considering potential solutions. He has requested for more analysis of the proposed selfish-mining algorithm at a specific share-of-network and gamma=0. To make the math easier, he assumes second-broadcast blocks always lose. However, he cannot reproduce the finding in the paper if he takes into account the "opportunity cost" of working on more blocks in the private chain that might be orphaned instead of always simply extending the public chain. He admits that it is possible that he's missing something obvious.</p>
