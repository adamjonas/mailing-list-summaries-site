        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>To improve the efficiency and speed of relaying Bitcoin data, users can now peer with public relay nodes. These relay nodes are located in different regions such as us-west, us-east, eu, au, or jpy. To connect to a relay node, users need to add "public.REGION.relay.mattcorallo.com" to their addnode list.Each relay node can be connected to either port 8334 or 8335, with the former only relaying blocks and the latter relaying both blocks and transactions. While the relay nodes do perform some data verification to prevent Denial of Service attacks (DoS), they do not fully verify the data they are relaying. Therefore, it is crucial for users to never mine a block based solely on a relayed block without conducting their own thorough verification using a bitcoin validator.The relay nodes do not follow the standard inv-getdata-tx/block flow; instead, they relay transactions and blocks immediately after performing cursory verification. It is important to understand that the relay nodes are not meant to replace the standard P2P network but rather to complement it. They are designed to augment the existing network and should not be relied upon to ensure that users never miss any data. There may be instances where the relay nodes fail to relay certain transactions. Furthermore, if a user disconnects and then reconnects, any missed data will not be sent again by the relay nodes. Therefore, it is still advisable to have peers on the standard P2P network.For important node operators such as merchants, exchanges, and large miners who wish to have access to relay nodes with fewer peers, there is a form available on the website to request additional domain names. The source code for the relay nodes can be found on GitHub, allowing users to review and contribute to their development.Users are encouraged to provide feedback, voice concerns, or make suggestions by emailing bitcoin-peering at mattcorallo.com. This helps in improving the relay node system and addressing any issues that may arise.</p>
