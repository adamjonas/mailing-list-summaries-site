        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo has created a system of high-speed relay nodes for miners and merchants/exchanges. The system aims to decrease block propagation times between miners and act as a fallback mechanism in the case that the public Bitcoin network encounters issues. The relay nodes do some data verification to prevent DoS but in order to keep relay fast, they do not fully verify the data they are relaying. Therefore, they are not designed to ensure that users never miss data, and may fail to relay some transactions.Additionally, because the relay nodes do not respond to standard getdata requests, if a user misses a relay and then reconnects, that data will not be sent again by the relay nodes. The relay nodes are not a replacement for having peers on the standard P2P network, they are only there to augment the existing P2P network. To peer with the public relay nodes, users can select the closest region out of us-west, us-east, eu, au, or jpy and add public.REGION.relay.mattcorallo.com to their addnode list. It is important to note that all relay nodes will relay between each other, so there is no latency advantage by peering with more than the closest node. For each relay node, users can connect to either port 8334 or 8335. It is suggested to split the block-only and block+tx not only by port number but also by DNS address to prevent DoS attacks by flooding transactions. This ensures that in the event of an attack, the more important block relaying functionality is less likely to be damaged. In the meantime, both DNS addresses should point to the same IP until it becomes an issue.Mike Hearn suggested a more concise way to replace verbose code. Matt confirmed that he had made the necessary changes. Mike also mentioned that for the concept of Matt's blockchain project to take off, he would need to recruit someone to help market it as pool operators wouldn't reach out to him.The code for transaction relay is different from that of block relay and the bandwidth for transaction relay on the nodes is lower than for blocks by design. However, tx-less block relays for transactions that peers already have may be considered to limit block relay times even for large blocks. In such cases, tx relay is necessary. John Dillon suggested splitting the block-only and block+tx not only by port number but also by DNS address would minimize the risk of a DoS attack by flooding transactions.In conclusion, Matt Corallo's system of peering between nodes in the Bitcoin network aims to create high-speed relay nodes for miners and merchants/exchanges. This network is open to everyone via public relay nodes but also has nodes made available only to large miners and merchants/exchanges to mitigate the ability of malicious parties to DoS the network. Interested parties can fill out a form to gain access to additional domain names which map to relay nodes with fewer peers.</p>
