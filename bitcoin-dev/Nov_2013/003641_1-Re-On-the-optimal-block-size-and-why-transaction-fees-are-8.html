    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this communication, Brian Goss, a medical doctor, asks Peter about the propagation time within a mining pool. He wonders if the propagation time from the pool to the miner has any impact on the analysis of Q for a mining pool when it is made up of ASICs connected by 300 baud modems. Peter explains that even now, the propagation time from the pool to the miner is significant, especially for pools that do not pay for stale shares. He also talks about how selfish mining and orphans are becoming more important in general, which could lead to the physical location of hashing power becoming centralized. If there is a 100ms delay to a pool, miners may locate their mining equipment physically closer to the pool to avoid losing profits. This could lead to pools wanting to be located closer to each other. Peter suggests that if all Bitcoin mining were done in one place, such as Iceland, it would not be good. Finally, he reassures Brian that his questions are not ignorant.</p>
