        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rafael Brune has developed a Bitcoin network simulator that functions as a stochastic event-based continuous-time simulation. This simulator focuses on the exchange of messages and the construction of block chains among miners. It includes two examples, one showcasing a 51% attack and the other demonstrating selfish mining. The simulator accurately represents latency, bandwidth, and verification speed. However, it currently does not simulate propagation or inclusion of transactions, instead relying on random block sizes.Another developer has also created a Bitcoin network simulator with similar principles, aiming to closely follow the protocol message structure. The ultimate objective is to create a network/chain visualization that operates smoothly in the browser. To ensure responsiveness, the simulation itself runs on a WebWorker. This second simulator encompasses a network of 1000 full nodes, including 100 miners, for a simulated duration of one week. Empty blocks, with the exception of the coinbase transaction, are generated within a timeframe of approximately 30-60 seconds using nodejs.The second simulator also integrates theoretical support for transaction propagation. This allows for testing of zero-conf functionality and its effectiveness. By utilizing this simulator, users can assess whether zero-conf capabilities function properly. Rafael Brune encourages others to explore his project and contribute to its enhancement. The Bitcoin network simulator he has developed can be accessed on his Github page.</p>
