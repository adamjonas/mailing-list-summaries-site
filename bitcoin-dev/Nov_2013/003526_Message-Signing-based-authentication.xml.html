    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 3, 2013, Allen Piscitello wrote about a use case he had where it was possible to generate a new key for a 2 of 2 Multisig Refund Tx instead of making sure there were no unspent outputs. The reason for doing this was laziness in just creating a single key. However, Bitcoin as a system has always required a unique EC key and address for each transaction. This means that use cases should be based on actual needs, not laziness. Luke emphasized the importance of use cases being grounded in actual needs rather than taking shortcuts.</p>
