        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses the difficulty of using Bitcoin on the AT&T network, as it does not allow for a public static IP without payment. This makes it difficult to open up ports for Bitcoin and act as a full node on the network. The author suggests that this is a problem faced by other large ISPs as well, leading to a decline in Bitcoin nodes. They believe that educating people on how to use Bitcoin Core when facing these security measures is crucial to prevent further decline in node numbers. Currently, there are only 37 nodes using AT&T worldwide, indicating the difficulty of using Bitcoin on this network.</p>
