    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion focuses on the challenges of implementing pay-with-diff, which would require miners to adjust their hashing difficulty in order to change the block size. One issue is the need for collusion among miners, unless there is idle hashpower available, which is unlikely. The potential loss does not economically compensate for size increase gains in most cases, when considering the variability of blocks and associated fee income. In addition, businesses will face challenges in planning due to the unpredictability and volatility of the block size and fee environment. The conclusion is that pay-with-diff will either not be used or lead to radical short-term changes in block size and fees, making it difficult for all players to reason and plan.</p>
