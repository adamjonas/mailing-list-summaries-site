    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email, Gavin Andresen proposed a new block propagation system which would involve miners pre-announcing the blocks they are working on to their peers. These "weak blocks" would be quickly validated by peers and when a full-difficulty block based on a previously announced weak block is found, block propagation should be insanely fast. This could incentivize miners to create blocks with fee-paying transactions rather than mining empty blocks. Miners could even try to avoid validation work by just taking a weak block announced by somebody else, replacing the coinbase and re-computing the merkle root, and then mining. Weak block announcements give transaction creators a good idea of whether or not their transactions are likely to be confirmed in the next block. The implementation of this new block propagation system shouldn't increase bandwidth or CPU usage significantly.</p>
