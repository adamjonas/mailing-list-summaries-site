    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core codebase is the most stable, and to create multiple implementations, other groups would fork Bitcoin Core. Innovation from any development group would be freely integrated by any other development group if desired, though each group would have a strong incentive to remain fork-wise compatible with the other implementations. The idea of never reaching consensus with Bitcoin Core has been suggested, which will provide impetus for new implementations to fork from Core and implement whatever scaling solution they deem best. Users will then select the winning solution simply based on the code they choose to run, and the decentralized spirit of Bitcoin will be in action. Decentralization in development was discussed, and it was suggested that supporting multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol could reduce the network's dependency on Core. However, the biggest problem with this is convincing users to adopt the new implementation, as Bitcoin Core is widely used due to the quality of its code. Many developers prefer to contribute to Bitcoin Core instead of writing their own implementation, making it stronger and better.</p>
