    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests a sophisticated method for choosing between two block solutions by computing a weighted sum of bitcoin-days-destroyed (BTCDD), where transactions received earlier are given higher weights. This method avoids allowing miners to use private transactions to manipulate the blockchain and also makes empty blocks less attractive. The proposal was posted on the stackexchange bitcoin site, and after addressing objections and problems, no significant issues were found. While some may argue that empty blocks and selfish mining aren't harmful to Bitcoin, proponents of the proposal are encouraged to collaborate on an implementation.</p>
