    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There has been a significant decline in the number of Bitcoin nodes, and one individual believes that this is due to censorship by internet service providers (ISPs) who are not being transparent about their actions. The author of an email struggled to open port 8333 on his network, which prevented him from running Bitcoin Core and developing programs with Python modules.The author discovered that AT&T had blocked access to the Bitcoin network via private subnets, making it impossible for computers to connect. Although he was able to switch to a public subnet, AT&T charged a monthly fee for a public static IP address, which was required to gain full participation in the Bitcoin network. The author ultimately managed to get a public static IP address by tweeting about the issue and was able to run Bitcoin Core again.The decline in nodes worldwide is likely due to ISPs like AT&T blocking access to the Bitcoin network via private subnets. The author believes that this issue needs to be explicitly addressed in instructions for running a full node, as it is a significant problem for anyone who wants to participate fully in the network.The information about the author's struggle with AT&T was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which focuses on technical development of Bitcoin. Additionally, the author's signature links to a website promoting a protocol concept for decentralization and expansion of a giving economy.</p>
