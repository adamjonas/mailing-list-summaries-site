    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the possibility of a selfish mining attack on the Bitcoin network. It is mentioned that such an attack would be possible but unlikely due to economic disincentives. However, one concern raised is the lack of a mechanism to lower the block size, which could make the network vulnerable to this type of attack. The proposal for a dynamic limit on the block size is discussed, with questions about what variables should be adjusted to make it more acceptable to Core developers like Gavin and Adam Back. In response, Adam Back clarifies that he was referring to the risk that excess block size could be used to amplify selfish mining instead of collecting transaction fees.</p>
