    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 4th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev proposed changing the number request process for BIPs. This is due to the previous process being created when a different solution was used for storing and presenting BIPs. The proposed new process would involve opening a pull request with the BIP text without a number assigned - just using the author's name and an index as the number - to request assignment. Maxwell requested that any responses to his proposal only address whether it was objectionable or not and to start a new thread for any other subject matter.</p>
