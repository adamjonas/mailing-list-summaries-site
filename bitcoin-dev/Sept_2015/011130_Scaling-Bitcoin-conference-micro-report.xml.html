    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin, despite its large user base, still faces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by governments. Hackers previously targeted routers to divert mining traffic, and Bitcoin traffic can easily be monitored and blocked by ISPs. Laws against merchants and exchanges cannot be defended against in any other way than having many people use the system. The threat of a small number of developers having significant influence over Bitcoin is also pointed out, with discussions on miner centralization taking precedence over developer decentralization. Increasing nodes or diversifying miners will have no effect if faced with government threats.</p>
