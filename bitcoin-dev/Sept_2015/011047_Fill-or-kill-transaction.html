    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 17, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n started a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list about the use of "fill or kill" in trades and how that can be confusing. In previous discussions, expiry time or op_height was used for expiration. Mark pointed out that it can be made safe by requiring that all outputs of a transaction that can expire have op_maturity/csv/rcltv of 100, which makes them as reorg-safe as coinbase transactions. However, this doesn't work well with p2sh. The discussion continued with a proposal to implement a "treat like Coinbase" flag in the UTXO set when the output is created, but there is no further information provided on whether it was implemented or not.</p>
