    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ahmed Zsales proposed a draft BIP for a block chain license to supplement the existing MIT License, which only covers the core reference client software. Warren Togami Jr. expressed skepticism that any license for the blockchain itself is needed because it might not be entitled to copyright protection. He cited U.S. copyright doctrine and ruled out the creative and non-obvious attributes of the perpetual compilation of unique data in the blockchain as grounds for legal protection. While acknowledging the different database law in Europe, he considered the topic worthy of further study and called for more scholarly and legal citations in the paper. Ahmed agreed with Wladimir's suggestion of placing this issue in a BIP advisory box for a while to give time for further investigations and possible input from miners. The review points towards this being worth coming back to, but they don't want to play at being lawyers. They referenced a case called Feist and provided a link to some general database protection details relevant to the USA.</p>
