    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jeff Garzik and Luke Dashjr, the former introduced a new proposal for Bitcoin called BIP100. Luke responded with some clarifications and suggestions. He agreed with most of Jeff's practical suggestions but raised concerns about the power to decrease the hard limit, which he believed was riskier long term. However, he noted that this could be mitigated by the ease at which miners could lower the block size locally or collectively without a vote. Luke also made several suggestions for improving BIP100, including combining rules 2 and 4 into one, modifying the voting system to require 50% to set the limit floor, and increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote.</p>
