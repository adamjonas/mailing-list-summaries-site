    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Arthur Bouquet, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has suggested the implementation of a new URI scheme to enable easy signature verification. He notes that while it is currently possible to request a payment using a bitcoin URI scheme (BIP0021), there is no easy way to ask for a signature or verify a message. Bouquet believes that with proper consensus, a URI scheme to use the signing tools in bitcoin core could be made available in most bitcoin clients that already support message signing/verifying and payment url (or QRCode). To gain proper consensus, Bouquet suggests going through a BIP, and he presents his idea publicly before proceeding any further. Bouquet proposes that the new URI scheme should require manual user approval similar to BIP0021, and it could use the same URI scheme with an additional parameter or use another one like BIP121. He plans to post a topic in the "Development & Technical Discussion" section on Bitcointalk to discuss his idea further. Overall, Bouquet's suggestion aims to make signature verification easier and more accessible within the Bitcoin community.</p>
