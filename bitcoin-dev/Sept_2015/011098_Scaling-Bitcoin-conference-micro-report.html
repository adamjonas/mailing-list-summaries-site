    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The state is considered to be the biggest threat in the Bitcoin threat model due to the assumption of hostile state actors being the most rational starting point. The attack surface in Bitcoin is that which is regulated and regulatable, making it a vulnerable target for government attacks. To reduce the attack surface as much as possible, it is better to be a marginalized alt-coin. However, there is a range of coins between DarkCoin and FedCoin that can be explored. Becoming popular and successful may lead to regulatory capture, leaving the vision of Bitcoin more vulnerable to government attacks. In a scenario where someone like Peter Todd is faced with 10 policemen in anti-riot gear, the best response would be to lose some fat, learn a few parkour tricks and move around mostly by night behind dumpsters.</p>
