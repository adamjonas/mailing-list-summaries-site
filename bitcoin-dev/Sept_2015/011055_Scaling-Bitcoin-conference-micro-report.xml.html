    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev, there was no consensus reached regarding the modification of block size limit regime to be cost-based via "net-utxo" rather than a simple static hard limit. Some suggested 2-4-8 and 17%/year as potential short term bump options with net after applying the new cost metric. However, hard numbers were deliberately not discussed and no agreement was made regarding an increase which continues over time. It was suggested that changing from block size to some other metric might provide the basis for a compromise on near-term numbers. While some expressed disagreement, a summary of the opinions expressed by core developers at the workshop was made by Jeff, and it was noted that this summary represents the majority view. There is hope that data will show the benefit of another metric or other metrics combined with net-UTXO in a way that will allow consensus on a proposal prior to the Hong Kong workshop in December.</p>
