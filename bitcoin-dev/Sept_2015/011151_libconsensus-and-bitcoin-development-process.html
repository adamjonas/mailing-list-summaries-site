    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the need for more links or hooks for developers to see the plan, order and sense in the endless stream of libconsensus refactoring PRs. Jeff Garzik points out that complex code changes with longer development cycles than simple code movement patches keep breaking. He suggests making a plan and not seeing a five year stream of random consensus code movement patches causing lots of downstream developer headaches. Developers are encouraged to imagine several different ways people might try to find this description in the future and make them work. Jorge Tim√≥n is working on separating libconsensus to maximize the number of people that can safely contribute to the project. He has tried many times and in many ways to communicate his plan but it seems as if everyone agrees with the idea but nobody thinks reviewing the necessary refactors to do so is a priority. His plan can be found in an email he wrote and in other threads. He consolidated three small consensus-related PRs into one with the hope that it would be merged relatively fast. After that, it will be much simpler to start talking about potential C APIs for VerifyHeader, VerifyTx and VerifyBlock as well as separating the library to a subtree.</p>
