    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of having a weekly developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev was proposed, with a preference for afternoons to late evenings Pacific Time. However, the issue of time zones was raised as this would translate to late night/early morning for those in Europe. A suggestion to use Doodle for time and date preferences was made. The purpose of the meetings would be for discussions and not decisions to avoid missing important events. A proposal was made for the meetings to be scheduled every Thursday at 15:00-16:00 UTC, with a +1 vote from Jonas Schnelli. The discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on September 18th, 2015.</p>
