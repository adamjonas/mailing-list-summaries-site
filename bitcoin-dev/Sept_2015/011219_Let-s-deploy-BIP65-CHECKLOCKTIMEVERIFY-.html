    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the addition of CLTV to the Bitcoin protocol, with a focus on how it would be added (hard-fork or soft-fork). The opcode definition seems acceptable. When asked if IsSuperMajority() CLTV soft-fork will be added to Bitcoin XT, the answer is yes. However, it might be best to put the version bit change behind a command line flag due to problems with the written BIP and deployment issues. The question of adding soft-fork detection to bitcoinj is met with resistance as it would be a pointless waste of effort and time since there is already a workable mechanism in place through the block chain itself. Attempting to make soft forks more like hard forks with complex mechanisms is unnecessary when going straight to the correct outcome is possible.</p>
