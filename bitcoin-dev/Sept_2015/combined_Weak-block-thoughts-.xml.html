        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation between Kalle Rosenbaum and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen is about weak blocks, which are pre-validated blocks that help speed up block propagation. Kalle asks why a miner would publish a weak block if they find one, as it seems like they are giving away fast propagation times to someone else. Gavin explains that the cost to a miner is effectively nothing if their transaction acceptance policy is predictable and that failing to send theirs does little to nothing to deny others the improvement. Gavin proposes an alternative weak-blockless weak block implementation where every miner sends to every other miner what they're working on every N seconds. This proposal has some problems and risks such as identity-based access control issues and DOS attacks. Hashcash is used in the weak blocks implementation as a rate-limiting mechanism to decide who can transmit. If a miner doesn't participate in the lottery and share their solutions, there is no major harm to other users. However, if their work was different from everyone else, they'll suffer because they failed to make use of their chance to influence what could be efficiently transmitted to include their own blocks.Gavin also discusses how weak block commitment must be exactly the block commitment, and otherwise, a small number of transactions will have to be added to a block above and beyond the latest well-propagated weak-blocks. The proposal creates pressure to crank up the weak block overhead, which could better be avoided. Bryan Bishop provided some links related to the weak block discussions, including Gavin's response to Peter R's paper, which was republished to the list. Gavin states that merged mined block DAG with blocks of arbitrary strength is always efficiently deferentially coded against prior state, which allows for new solutions to be efficiently transmitted even if they differ in arbitrary ways. There is a cost to these schemes - additional overhead from communicating the efficiently encoded weak blocks. Incentive compatibility analysis is unclear. Peter R asks if mining pools and miners should be paying the developers for coding solutions that improve their profitability. Gavin responds that better common open infrastructure helps mostly in putting propagation disadvantaged miners on an equal playing field, but there are simple, expedient, and low-risk ways to improve their equality in that respect, such as centralizing by using bigger pools.</p>
