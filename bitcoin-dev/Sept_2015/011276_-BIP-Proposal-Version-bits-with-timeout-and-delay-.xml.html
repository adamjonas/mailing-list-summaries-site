    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom Harding suggested an idea of adding a one-period "burn-in" to show sustained support of the threshold, instead of a simple one-period delay. During this period, support must continuously remain above the threshold. Any lapse resets to inactivated state. The reasoning behind this suggestion is that with a simple delay, there is a possibility of having support fall off during the delay period and far below threshold support just moments prior to enforcement, but enforcement happens anyway. However, Rusty Russell argued that keeping it simple and well defined is important, especially when accounting for all corner cases. Finally, Gavin agreed with Russell's perspective.</p>
