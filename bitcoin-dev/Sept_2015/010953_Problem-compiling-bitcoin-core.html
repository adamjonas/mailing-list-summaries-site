    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, LinuXperia is seeking help to compile Bitcoin Core on their Ubuntu Linux machine. They have followed the standard procedures by running "./autogen.sh" and "./configure," but they are encountering a build error. Sriram Karra, a member of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, responds by pointing out that the Boost libs cannot be found and asks why LinuXperia is attempting to build with a custom lib directory. LinuXperia shares their configuration command, which includes specifying CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for the custom lib directory. The error message indicates undefined references to various Boost functions. It is suggested that LinuXperia was using the wrong build option, which should have been "--with-gui=no."The email thread ends with links to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list and instructions to sign up for it. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of following the correct build options and dependencies when compiling Bitcoin Core.</p>
