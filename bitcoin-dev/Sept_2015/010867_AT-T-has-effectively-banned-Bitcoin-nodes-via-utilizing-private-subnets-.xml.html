    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The sender of an email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list on 2 September 2015 is upset that AT&T has banned Bitcoin nodes by utilising private subnets. They claim that every port was blocked, making exceptions in the router firewall did nothing, and they were forced to use Blockchain.info which is a major security risk. The sender could not run any code until this issue was fixed, and of course needed the block source to even do anything. AT&T had tried to get them to buy monthly subscriptions to get the answer. According to this person, Bitcoin Core is unusable for most AT&T customers and other ISPs, hence the massive node decline. Nodes are in fact declining worldwide, down 15% in the past year alone. The sender suggests that the community needs to speak up and also educate before this gets completely out of control. In response to this email, another member of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list replies with information from BitNodes, stating that there are 42 Bitcoin nodes running on AT&T's network, suggesting that there is nothing wrong with AT&T's default network configuration. This person also claims that the things the first person wrote strongly suggest that they aren't very knowledgeable about computer networking.</p>
