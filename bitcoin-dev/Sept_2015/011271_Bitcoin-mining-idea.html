    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email dated September 29, 2015, Jonathan Toomim of Toomim Bros responded to a post that made a statement about a developer's personal character. Toomim argued that such statements were off-topic for the list and should not be discussed. However, he also noted that if this rule were strictly enforced, up to 20-30% of the discussions on the list would be considered off-topic. The context suggests that personal attacks or comments about developers' characters were common in the discussion group at the time.</p>
