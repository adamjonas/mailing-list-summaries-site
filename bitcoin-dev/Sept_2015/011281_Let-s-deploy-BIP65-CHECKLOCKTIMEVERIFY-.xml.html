    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin workshop, Gavin discussed with Adam that XT may be willing to make things easy and adapt what it's doing. For instance, in relation to versionBits, Gavin said he would be willing to update XT with an updated/improved versionBits. It is suggested that both Core and XT follow a constructive approach and do what is simple and clean if there is no particular philosophy debate on a given technical topic.On September 30, 2015, Rusty Russell via bitcoin-dev wrote that a simple "block version >= 4" check is insufficient due to XT, which sets version bits 001....111. He suggests using a simple test, "if (pstart->nVersion & 0x8) ++nFound;", which means that XT won't trigger it, it won't trigger XT, block nVersion can simply be set to 8 for now, and versionbits can still be used in parallel later. Wladimir J. van der Laan via bitcoin-dev agrees and states that it is time to deploy BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and that there appears to be common agreement on that. However, the only source of some controversy is how to deploy: versionbits versus IsSuperMajority. He thinks that the versionbits proposal should first have code out there for longer before they consider it for concrete softforks. Haste-ing along versionbits because CLTV is wanted would be risky.</p>
