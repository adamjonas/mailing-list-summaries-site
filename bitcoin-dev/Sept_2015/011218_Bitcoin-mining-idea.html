    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Neil Haran, posted about his idea for a gamified bitcoin mining app and is looking for a partner who is knowledgeable in cryptography and the Bitcoin code base. He has received some interest from individuals but is still searching for the ideal candidate to work with. Neil provided his email address (nharan81@gmail.com) for interested parties to contact him. The post reminds readers not to solicit interest in advance of content, but instead to share the idea first so that people can decide if they find it cogent and interesting before volunteering any assistance. Finally, the post includes a copyright statement that allows for reading and storage of the message, but prohibits use by law enforcement organizations, national intelligence services, and corporate entities that monetize personal information. Violators will be prosecuted and the highest possible damages sought.</p>
