    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin decentralization is often misconstrued as a way to protect against government attacks. However, this notion is misguided since large user bases do not prevent chokepoints that can be targeted by the government. Decentralization does not serve as a tool to fight governments, which is a misconception perpetuated by many who confuse Bitcoin with Anonymous. Instead, growth needs to occur in the number of participants in the network's basic infrastructure such as miners and validators. While no one disputes the importance of decentralization, the question remains about who will pay for it, and what incentives must exist. For these goals to be achieved, it is necessary for Bitcoin to become more popular.</p>
