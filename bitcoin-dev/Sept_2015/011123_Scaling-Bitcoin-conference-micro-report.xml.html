    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context highlights the significance of considering governments as a potential threat model. The term "threat model" refers to identifying and evaluating possible threats that a system or organization may face. While responding to someone's comment, the speaker clarifies that no one should overlook governments as a threat. The Wikipedia page on threat models explains this concept in detail.The speaker further suggests that constructing a "proper threat model" is challenging since attackers are not limited to any particular boundaries. In other words, it is tough to anticipate all possible attack scenarios and prepare for them. To illustrate this point, the speaker gives an example wherein any significant government could obtain 51% of hash power and restrict transactions only from "certified services." This scenario can lead to censorship and undermine the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.</p>
