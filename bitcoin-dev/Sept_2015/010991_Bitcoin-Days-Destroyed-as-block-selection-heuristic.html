    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread titled "Alternate tie-breaker proposal" on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christophe Biocca and Jorge Timón discuss Dave Scotese's proposal for a more sophisticated method of choosing which of two block solutions to accept. Biocca believes that it is not necessary since miners would not benefit from running this policy in the long run, and users would still have to keep waiting for block confirmations to reduce the chances of a successful double-spend attack. Timón points out that there is already a criterion to choose between two blocks: the one with more work in valid blocks on top of it. However, the issue of determining which of two blocks with the same height is "newer" remains unclear.</p>
