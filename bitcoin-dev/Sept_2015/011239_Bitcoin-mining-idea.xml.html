    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this post is responding to individuals who are claiming that certain topics being discussed on a development discussion list for Bitcoin protocol and its implementation are "off-topic". The author argues that the list's subject is broad enough to encompass a number of topics, and that those who claim otherwise seem to be making up their own rules. Additionally, one person has been contacting others and threatening to have the list moderated if they do not follow his self-imposed rules, despite having no authority and no official rules to reference.The author suggests that a more precise description may be necessary if the discussion is to be limited in some way beyond the current "official" description. Overall, the author believes that claims about what should be posted on the list are without merit and that individuals should not be making up their own rules without proper authority or guidelines.</p>
