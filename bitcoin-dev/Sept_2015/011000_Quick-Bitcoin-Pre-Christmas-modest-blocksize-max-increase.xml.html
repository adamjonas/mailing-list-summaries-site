    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin-dev mailing list received an email proposing a short-term modest blockchain increase before the winter shopping rush, followed by the adoption of a new system for fast transactions due to technical limitations of scaling. The proposal suggests building a new system re-using the Bitcoin name, referred to as QuickBitcoin or qbtc, which works on top of traditional Bitcoins but has a mechanism for more/faster transactions. The proposal aims to scale Bitcoin while maintaining the strength of its existing network, community, and branding. However, the recipient of the email did not find the proposal to add anything to the current discussion and recommended reading more emails from the mailing list.</p>
