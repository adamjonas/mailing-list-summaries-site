    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the issue of copyright ownership and licensing of transactions in the blockchain. One member argues that putting everything in public domain is the reason why Bitcoin works, but taking it to an extreme can be seen as an argument against attempts to obfuscate transaction ownership. Another member raises concerns over who owns the copyright of transactions, as there are multiple parties involved in publishing and reproducing them. They also point out that transaction malleability creates derivative works with multiple copyright holders, which can lead to legal issues. The suggestion is made to put everything in the public domain or something similar, as copyright in the blockchain can create a situation similar to the DVDCSS illegal prime mess.</p>
