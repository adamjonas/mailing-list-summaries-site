    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list was created in 2011 to focus on the technical aspects of core software and avoid philosophical discussions. However, the list has become cluttered with off-topic noise, impacting productivity. To address this issue, a discussion list is being created as an outlet for these types of conversations. Jonathan Toomim stated that making statements about a developer's personal character is off-topic, to which Milly Bitcoin replied that such comments make up a significant portion of the current postings. The developers who created the bitcoin-dev list are in agreement that something needed to be done about the off-topic noise.</p>
