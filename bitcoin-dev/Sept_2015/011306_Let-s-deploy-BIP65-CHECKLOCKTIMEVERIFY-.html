    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jorge Timón, the two debated the concept of consensus in relation to bip65. Hearn argued that there is no consensus around bip65 because several people oppose it, while Timón argued that it should be considered uncontroversial because of fallacious arguments against it. The conversation also touched on the topic of SPV (Simplified Payment Verification), which Hearn claimed to have coined and implemented through bitcoinj and BreadWallet. Timón responded by pointing out that SPV is actually section 8 in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Additionally, Hearn defended his work on SPV implementation by stating that those who criticize it lack real-world experience. Finally, the conversation turned to the idea of hardforks and how they can cause forks in the blockchain. Timón argued that softfork-caused forks will live shortly because non-upgraded miners will build on top of the longest upgraded chain, whereas a hardfork will create a parallel chain that can be used to defraud non-upgraded or SPV users by isolating them and showing them only the non-upgraded chain.</p>
