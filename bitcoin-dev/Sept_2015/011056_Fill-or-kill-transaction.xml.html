    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, several developers are discussing the implementation of the "fill-or-kill" feature as a consensus rule. The fill-or-kill feature refers to a transaction being confirmed within a few confirms or dropped from the mempool so that it won't be considered for inclusion anymore. One developer suggests repurposing a small range of nLocktime, which is a field in Bitcoin transactions used to specify a minimum block height or timestamp until which the transaction cannot be spent. The repurposed nLocktime would accept a transaction into the mempool for a specific period before expiring. The original poster, jl2012, raises the point that they want to implement fill-or-kill as a consensus rule, meaning that it would be enforced by all nodes on the network. Another developer suggests adding a rule that makes the transaction invalid to mine after it has expired, which would keep the simplicity of the proposed solution while making it consensus-based. There is some discussion about whether the feature would be better implemented at the P2P network level or as a consensus rule.</p>
