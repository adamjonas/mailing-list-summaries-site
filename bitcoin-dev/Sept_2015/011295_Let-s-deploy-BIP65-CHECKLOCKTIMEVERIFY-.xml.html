    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and another member of the bitcoin-dev community, the topic of soft forks is discussed. The other member argues that soft forks are advantageous because network convergence is guaranteed assuming the hashrate majority upgrades. They believe that soft forks are generally safer than hard forks, despite Hearn's objection to them on the grounds that they create financial risk unnecessarily. The other member claims that this consensus rule change is uncontroversial and therefore the safest option for deployment. They plan to update BIP99 with a new section that discusses the trade-offs of uncontroversial soft forks versus uncontroversial hard forks. They argue that there is no need to wait for Hearn to understand the advantages of soft forks before moving forward with the proposed consensus rule change. Finally, they assert that the new script operator in question is an important feature that enables new contracts and should not be blocked just to make a point about what "uncontroversial" means.</p>
