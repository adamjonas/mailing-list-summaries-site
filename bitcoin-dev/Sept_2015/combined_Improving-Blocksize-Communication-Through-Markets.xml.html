        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a conversation thread, Isidor challenged the necessity of having another side-chain to resolve the Bitcoin block size issue. He explained that market forces could decide at the point where every Bitcoin user starts discriminating the Bitcoins they accept between the client versions of blocks where the Bitcoins come from. Additionally, he believed that holding a conference in Montreal to solve a global issue is an example of centralizing Bitcoin. The author of the email suggested that people should stop talking about block size issues and focus on discussing other features instead. They also questioned the amount of money spent on conferences and suggested there should be a more direct way of purchasing information.The author then introduced their solution to improving the discussion around block size issues, which involves using a method advocated by Hal Finney seven years ago. The solution is already coded into the author's own project, Truthcoin. However, they invited competent C++ developers to collaborate with them for 30 minutes and potentially complete the coding within one weekend. More details about the project can be found on the Bitcoin Block Size website and technical specifications are available on Github. The author further created a Slack channel for further discussions on the topic.</p>
