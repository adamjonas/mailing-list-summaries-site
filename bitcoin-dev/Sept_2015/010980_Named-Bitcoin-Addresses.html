    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 10, 2015, a member of the Bitcoin developer community proposed a solution to the problem of complex and difficult-to-memorize Bitcoin addresses. The proposal suggested assigning unique names to Bitcoin addresses for easier sharing and increased user-friendliness. Using the example of Bob and Alice transacting with a named Bitcoin address, the proposal outlined how Bob could create a new named address by simply entering his preferred name into his wallet and verifying its availability through a directory of previously chosen names. Once verified, Bob's client would send a transaction to an address without a private key but viewable on the blockchain, with the name appended as an OP_RETURN output. Alice could then easily send Bitcoin to Bob's named address using a similar binary search method to verify the name's availability. The proposal aimed to provide a completely verifiable and independent method of assigning names to Bitcoin addresses.</p>
