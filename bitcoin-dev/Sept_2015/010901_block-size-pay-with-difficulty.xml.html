    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the feasibility of a difficulty penalty scheme in Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik appears to be of the opinion that such a scheme is not workable due to the unpredictability it would introduce to the block size and fee environment, making planning difficult for businesses. Gregory Maxwell disagrees with this assertion, arguing that most of the difficulty-based adjustments have small limits on the difficulty change and wouldn't cause significant changes in interblock times relative to orphaning. He also notes that pay-for-size schemes have been successfully used in some altcoins without adverse effects. The discussion also touches on proposals by BtcDrak and Greg Maxwell for increasing block size, with the former proposing permanent increases through voting while the latter suggests temporary increases only for specific blocks. The debate highlights the importance of predictability and stability in Bitcoin's markets and systems.</p>
