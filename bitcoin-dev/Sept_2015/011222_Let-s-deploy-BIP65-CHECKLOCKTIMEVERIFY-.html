    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the development mailing list, Gavin Andresen requested that somebody write up a risk/benefit security tradeoff analysis document regarding the risks to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes and how they can be mitigated. He suggested that deploying mempool-only first could be a solution to the issue before the soft fork rolls out. Peter Todd asked if there was such a document for BIP101, but Andresen replied that he couldn't remember ever being asked for one. Todd responded that he would have to check with his clients to see if any would be willing to let him publish one he had done in the past. The conversation then turned to the topic of a blog post explaining Core's pull-req 5000, which satisfies the mempool-only solution, and how it should be communicated to full node and wallet developers. It was suggested that this type of information should be included in the bitcoin.org developer documentation as well. The topic of SPV wallets based on bitcoinj was also discussed, along with differing views from Mike Hearn that need to be resolved.</p>
