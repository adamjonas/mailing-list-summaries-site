    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, several updates were proposed for the block size limit. A user named Tier Nolan suggested that byte resolution may not be necessary in favor of using MB resolution, as it would use up fewer bytes in the coinbase. He also questioned if the 32MB limit still exists in the code and explained that there is no reason why a single message should be used for each block. Changing hardLimit was suggested to be accomplished by encoding a proposed value within a block's coinbase scriptSig, while votes refer to a byte value encoded within the pattern "/BVd+/". Votes out of range are considered to vote for the nearest in-range value. The new hardLimit is set to the median of the highest and lowest values within a certain percentile range, with votes that are absent or invalid being counted as 1M votes. Alternatively, miners may vote in different styles such as "/BV1234567/", "/BV1500K/", and "/BV3M/" to indicate their preferences.</p>
