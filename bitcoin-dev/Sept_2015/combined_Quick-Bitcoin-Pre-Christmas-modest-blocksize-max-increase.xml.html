        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A member of the Bitcoin Development team, Jason Livesay, has suggested building a new system with the Bitcoin name to maintain brand momentum, network, and business investment. He proposed that the new system should be packaged with the Bitcoin core client and referred to as QuickBitcoin or qbtc, and work on top of traditional Bitcoins but have a mechanism for more/faster transactions. The development team should only concern themselves with technical issues, according to Livesay. A short-term modest blockchain increase before the winter shopping rush has been recommended, followed by the adoption of a new system for fast transactions due to scaling limitations.The proposal aims to scale Bitcoin while maintaining the strength of its existing network, community, and branding. However, the future of such a system does not look promising, as retail spending still makes up only a small percentage of Bitcoin transactions, and there are no indications of any significant changes in retail spending compared to last year. The exact mechanism of the new system doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be reasonably secure/useful and something that the community will accept. The recipient of the email did not find the proposal to add anything to the current discussion and recommended reading more emails from the mailing list. Despite this, the smoothest path forward is believed to be building a new additional system re-using the Bitcoin name, which comes packaged with the Bitcoin core client and works on top of traditional Bitcoins but has a mechanism for more/faster transactions. As far as the public is concerned, this new system could simply continue to be called Bitcoin.</p>
