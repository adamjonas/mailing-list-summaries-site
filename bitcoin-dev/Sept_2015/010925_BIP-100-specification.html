    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There has been a recent change in the Bitcoin protocol that reduces the block size to 2MB. This change is likely due to concerns about an increase in the attack vector if BIP101's allowance for larger block sizes were implemented. Simon Liu suggested grabbing code from BIP101, which permits block messages greater than 2MB while retaining the current limit of 2MB on other network messages. The 32MB limit was patched a few months ago and can be found on Github. The limit is designed to keep message sizes small enough that they can be serialized in memory. There is discussion about lifting the 32MB limit and having the ceiling auto-raise according to a factor starting one year from now. The delay time could also be longer depending on how long it takes to fix the message size issue across all implementations.</p>
