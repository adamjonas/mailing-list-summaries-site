    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell suggested the weak block transaction list needs to be a superset of the block transaction list size proportional propagation costs so that these costs are not completely eliminated. A dynamic POW threshold has been proposed as a solution. The first weak block that builds on a new block could be forwarded with a smaller target, which would reduce the window size until at least one weak block is propagated. However, this could cause a surge in traffic when a new block has propagated. In case there is a transaction backlog, miners can forward merkle branches with transactions in the memory pool with a commitment in the coinbase.</p>
