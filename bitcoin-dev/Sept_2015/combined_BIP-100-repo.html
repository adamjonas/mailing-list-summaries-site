        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On September 2, 2015, Jeff Garzik proposed changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 100 (BIP 100) repository on GitHub. The proposal aimed to set a new 1 MB floor, which would allow for future increases and decreases in the block size limit. However, some members of the community expressed concerns that this limit may be too high. Garzik suggested using a numeric value pushed after height instead of 11 bytes of coinbase to vote on the block size limit. He also proposed increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote. In order to make it clear that the limit remains a part of the consensus protocol and that p2p protocol limits do not affect consensus rules, Garzik suggested combining two rules into one. This rule would lift the 1 MB limit to 32 MB or any other value deemed appropriate. Finally, Garzik suggested modifying the voting process to require 50% to set the limit floor.In an email exchange on September 2, 2015, between Jeff Garzik and Luke Dashjr regarding the newly added 1 MB floor to the bitcoin block size limit proposal, Luke suggests that the 1M is a safety rail and cannot perform worse than the current system. He also questions why the new size limit votes must use 11 bytes of coinbase and suggests increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote since this is a hardfork. Furthermore, he suggests modifying the voting to require 50% to set the limit floor so that it coordinates with what miners can already effectively do today by rejecting blocks larger than some collusion-determined limit.Jeff's original question was about the purpose of the newly added 1 MB floor which he believes to be too high for the limit at present, and the fact that it is one-sided to only allow increases when decreases are much more likely to be needed in the short term. He suggests combining two rules into a single rule lifting the 1 MB limit to 32 MB or whatever value is deemed appropriate to make it clear that the limit remains a part of the consensus protocol and p2p protocol limits are not to have an effect on consensus rules.The conversation discusses the concept of "votes" in relation to Bitcoin. It is unclear if it is a semi-automatic or fully automated process. The number of options and values for votes can have an impact on outcomes. There is currently no fee market in Bitcoin, but it could be a good goal to strive towards. Implementing a fee market would require a pricing mechanism and actual commitments. However, Bitcoin is not capable of adapting to this yet. Luke raised concerns about the power to decrease the hard limit, which he believed was riskier long term, but noted that this could be mitigated by the ease at which miners could lower the block size locally or collectively without a vote. A new repository has been created which contains the complete discussion document of BIP 100 in markdown format. This will be followed by the submission of the formal specification of BIP 100 to the upstream bips.git repository. The message is a communication sent via email by Jeff Garzik on September 2, 2015, to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. In the message, Garzik shares that he has opened a repository containing the full text of BIP 100 discussion document in markdown format. The BIP 100 formal specification will also be checked into the same repository before submitting it to the upstream bips.git repo. Garzik provides a link to the newly created repository in his previous email, which had failed to include the link. The context suggests that the email was part of a wider conversation about a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy - ABIS.IO. The link to the repository provided in the context is <a href="https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100">https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100</a>.</p>
