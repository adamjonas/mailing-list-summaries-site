        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A writer is searching for a fuzzer for push tx APIs that can send random data and fuzz particular aspects of the transaction format. They have listed several endpoints they would like to test, such as <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/pushtx/,">https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/pushtx/,</a> <a href="https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/send,">https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/send,</a> <a href="https://blockchain.info/pushtx,">https://blockchain.info/pushtx,</a> and others. The desired fuzzer should be able to fuzz valid and invalid script formats and change the order of op codes, among other things. In an email exchange on September 1, 2015, Monarch shared two ideas with Kristov for fuzzing bitcoin transactions. The first idea was random bit flipping from valid transactions while the second idea involved random transaction script generators, including generators from a grammar, a stochastic grammar, and a random sequence of opcodes. Manuel expressed interest in contributing to the project and shared links to his past experiments on fuzzing.Wladimir J. van der Laan responded to Monarch's email and commented on blockchain.info's problems with validation due to not using a full validating node. These problems included improper signature verification and loose coinbase transaction relaying, which caused instant banning from connected nodes. He suggested that there is potential for fun with fuzzing those APIs.In a Bitcoin developer forum, Monarch expressed concern about nodes that are not validating transactions before broadcasting them. This would make them of minimum concern to the P2P network. Blockchain.info experienced some problems related to this as they were not using a full validating node underneath which resulted in improper verification of signatures and a panic when it appeared that a massive number of old coins were being spent on their site. They were also relaying loose coinbase transactions that led to an instant ban from connected nodes. Wladimir states that there is potential for mischief with fuzzing those APIs.In another bitcoin-dev thread, Kristov Atlas expressed interest in developing a fuzzer for push tx APIs but could not find one after a brief search. Jonas Nick provided two links to Bitcoin Consensus Test Cases and his blog post on fuzzing Bitcoin Consensus. According to Nick, the only implementations with significant network presence are btcd and Bitcoin Core, and fuzzing them should be sufficient if these services validate transactions using either of the two. Two implementations linked by Atlas were based in Insight that uses Bitcoin Core for validation. If they don't validate transactions before broadcast, they will not make it beyond a single hop through the P2P network and are of minimal concern. The writer of this message is open to recommendations on how such a fuzzer should be structured. Finally, the writer invites anyone interested in collaborating to contact them via private message.</p>
