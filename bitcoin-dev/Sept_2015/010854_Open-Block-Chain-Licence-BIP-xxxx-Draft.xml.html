    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the need for a blockchain license to supplement the existing MIT license, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list expressed concern that such a proposal would be impossible since every existing transaction author and miner who published a block would have to agree to the terms for them to be legal. The author of the proposal countered that the data is public domain and unrestricted based on various assumptions and that most transactions are not created by Bitcoin Core these days. They also proposed that miners should be the primary beneficiaries of licensing and possibly vote to adopt new terms, even though it was not their preferred route, as this would overcome any issues caused by "an otherwise honest 'error and omission.'" However, another member of the mailing list pointed out that licensing after the fact requires the permission of every copyright holder for the change to be made, making it an impossible task. They suggested that the proposal would create more problems than it solves.</p>
