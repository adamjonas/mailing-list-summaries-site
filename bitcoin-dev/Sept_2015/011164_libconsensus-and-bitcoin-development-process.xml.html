    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dave Scotese, a Bitcoin developer, believes that developers require more links or "hooks" to see the missing aspects in the development process. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin developer, expressed concerns over the lack of apparent plan for libconsensus and the impact that refactoring could have on downstream developers. Jorge Timón, the developer working on libconsensus, responded by stating that he had communicated his plans for libconsensus multiple times. He explained that he tried creating big pull requests previously for people to understand the big picture, but they were too many commits for people to review. He also mentioned that he had smaller one-little-step PRs that were part of a longer branch. Now, he consolidated three of them in one PR with the hope that it would be merged relatively fast. Finally, he invited anyone interested to ask questions about any of the PRs or commits.</p>
