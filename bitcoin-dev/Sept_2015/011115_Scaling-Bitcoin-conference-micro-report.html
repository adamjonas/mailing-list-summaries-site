    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article argues that the proposed legislation to violate the 2nd amendment right to keep and bear arms in the US goes nowhere due to overwhelming resistance. The US has weak gun control laws compared to other first world countries. The comparison between gun control laws and BitTorrent is weak as governments do not care enough about piracy to put serious effort into enforcement. Internet-based black markets exist because governments tolerate them, but a ban on Tor or Bitcoin would send them back to their virtually non-existent state pre-2011. Governments tolerate such abuse because they believe in the great benefits that Bitcoin can have for their ordinary voters. However, for that to continue, the benefits must actually appear, and it requires growth. The article also discusses the difference between natural growth and the kind of growth proposed by bank-backed start-ups and pro-censorship entities.</p>
