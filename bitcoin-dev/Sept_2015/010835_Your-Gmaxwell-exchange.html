    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Monarch made a comment about the difficulty of software development with regards to decentralised bitcoin development. Dave Collins responded by stating that there have not been any btcd mainnet forks since it came out of alpha and that common consensus check code is now available in several bitcoin implementations. He claims that this is just engineering work that needs to get done if Bitcoin is to survive. Monarch then clarified that his comment was not intended as an attack against any specific software but rather to highlight the difficulty of working on decentralized bitcoin development. He noted that the use of CPP and OpenSSL can make it difficult to infer behavior and that there are likely more problems lurking in the transaction environment. However, these issues affect the Satoshi client as much as other implementations and do not support the premise that alternative implementations are inherently more difficult to develop.</p>
