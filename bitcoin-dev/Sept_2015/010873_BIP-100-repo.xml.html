    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 2, 2015, Jeff Garzik proposed changes to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 100 (BIP 100) repository on GitHub. The proposal aimed to set a new 1 MB floor, which would allow for future increases and decreases in the block size limit. However, some members of the community expressed concerns that this limit may be too high. Garzik suggested using a numeric value pushed after height instead of 11 bytes of coinbase to vote on the block size limit. He also proposed increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote. In order to make it clear that the limit remains a part of the consensus protocol and that p2p protocol limits do not affect consensus rules, Garzik suggested combining two rules into one. This rule would lift the 1 MB limit to 32 MB or any other value deemed appropriate. Finally, Garzik suggested modifying the voting process to require 50% to set the limit floor. This would coordinate what miners can already do by rejecting blocks larger than some collusion-determined limit.</p>
