    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen, concerns were raised over the need for a risk/benefit security analysis document to be written and published to address the risks posed to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes by the upcoming soft fork. It was suggested that mempool-only deployment could mitigate some of these risks. However, better communication is needed to ensure SPV wallet authors are aware of what they should be doing in preparation for the soft fork. While Peter Todd requested a security analysis document for BIP 101, Gavin Andresen suggested he already had something to start from, though no such document has been mentioned in the context. A blog post explaining why Core deployed pull-req 5000 as a best practice for being soft-fork ready was also suggested.</p>
