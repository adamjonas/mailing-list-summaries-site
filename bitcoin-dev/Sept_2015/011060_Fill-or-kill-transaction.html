    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development forum, a user named Btc Drak questioned the complexity of implementing fill-or-kill transactions by repurposing a small range of nLockTime. He suggested that a transaction could be accepted into the mempool for a specific period before expiring and being dropped from consideration for inclusion. Another user, jl2012, proposed implementing the fill-or-kill rule as a consensus rule rather than only at the P2P network level. They both agreed that adding a new nKillTime field to the transaction would be the cleanest way to use nLockTime and nKillTime in parallel, but it would require a hardfork. Other alternatives were also discussed such as embedding nKillTime data within an unused nVersion or utilizing per-input nKillTime and nLockTime with nSequence.</p>
