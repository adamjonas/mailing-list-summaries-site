    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea that if the blocksize divide is hinging on differing developer views on the nature of the threat posed by governments, then it would be better to defer to people who specialize in that area. The suggestion is to consider Bitcoin policy experts like Jerry Brito, Alex Fowler, Constance Choi, Jim Harper, Patrick Murck, etc., or even political philosophers if necessary. The author argues that if this is a politics question, one should consider being outside their area of expertise and seek help from those who are more knowledgeable. In response to Mike's comment that Obama would like to restrict guns but can't because they are too popular, the author notes that the government tolerates black markets only because they believe that Bitcoin can have great benefits for their ordinary voters. However, he questions why there is an institution that usurps the responsibility of determining for oneself whether or not a popular thing provides great benefits. He suggests studying some history, including the origination of public schooling, the idea of a state, and books like Tragedy and Hope and Kicking the Dragon. The author goes by the username "notplato" for a reason, indicating his interest in philosophy and critical thinking. The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, inviting further discussion on the topic.</p>
