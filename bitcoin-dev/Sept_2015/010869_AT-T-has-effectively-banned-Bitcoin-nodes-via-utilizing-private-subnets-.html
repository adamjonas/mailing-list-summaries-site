    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the conversation is related to AT&T's firewall settings and how it affects the functionality of Bitcoin nodes. The original poster claimed that AT&T has made it effectively impossible for Bitcoin nodes to function as they have blocked all ports via private subnets. In response, another person in the conversation pointed out that according to BitNodes, 42 Bitcoin nodes are running on AT&T's network which suggests no issue with their default configuration. However, the original poster argued that there is a firewall in the DVR that is uncontrolled and confirmed this with AT&T technicians. They also claimed that every port was blocked, including exceptions in the router firewall, making it impossible to sync the wallet. Additionally, the original poster said they were developing a program using Bitcoin Python modules and could not run any code until the connection was fixed, further emphasizing the problem. Finally, the decline of nodes worldwide is discussed, down 15% in the past year alone, and the community is urged to speak up and educate others about this issue.</p>
