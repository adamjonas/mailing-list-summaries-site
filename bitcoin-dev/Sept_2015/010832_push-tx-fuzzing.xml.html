    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin developer forum, Monarch expressed concern about nodes that are not validating transactions before broadcasting them. This would make them of minimum concern to the P2P network. Blockchain.info experienced some problems related to this as they were not using a full validating node underneath which resulted in improper verification of signatures and a panic when it appeared that a massive number of old coins were being spent on their site. They were also relaying loose coinbase transactions that led to an instant ban from connected nodes. Wladimir states that there is potential for mischief with fuzzing those APIs.</p>
