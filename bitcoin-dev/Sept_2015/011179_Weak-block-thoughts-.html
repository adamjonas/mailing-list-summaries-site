    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen has suggested that implementing 'weak blocks' could improve the mining code and prevent DoS attacks. Weak blocks would see miners pre-announce blocks they are working on before solving the proof-of-work puzzle, with an amount of proof-of-work done to rate-limit how many weak block messages are relayed across the network. Miners are currently incentivised to mine empty blocks as soon as they see a block with valid proof-of-work. If miners pre-announce blocks they are working on, peers can validate those weak blocks quickly. Once a full-difficulty block based on a previously announced weak block is found, block propagation should be fast.</p>
