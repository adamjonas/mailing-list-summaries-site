    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that a block chain license is necessary to supplement the existing MIT License, which is believed to only cover the core reference client software. However, before obtaining a license, it is important to determine the entity that holds the MIT License, as just posting a notice does not necessarily make it true. Additionally, there may not even be a valid license on the software in question. If a blockchain license were to be obtained, it is unclear what entity would hold this license and who would make that decision. If the developers themselves were to decide, it would suggest that they own the blockchain, which may not be consistent with the current situation. Therefore, it is recommended to consult a lawyer before proceeding with any licensing agreements.</p>
