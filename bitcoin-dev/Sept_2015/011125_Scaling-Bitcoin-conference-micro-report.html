    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is between Steven Pine and Milly Bitcoin, which was sent via the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. Steven commented on trusting governments and called them a threat model, citing various reasons for his opinions. Milly responded by asking how things can be 'settled' in the current environment and mentioned that people believe a small group of developers and miners control the decisions related to Bitcoin. In response, Steven made a decent point but requested that they keep the discourse civil, as it's already difficult trying to figure things out without causing more conflict.</p>
