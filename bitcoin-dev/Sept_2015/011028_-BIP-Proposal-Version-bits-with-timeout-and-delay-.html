    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in September 2015, Tier Nolan and Jorge Timón were discussing the percentage of hash power required to activate a proposed soft fork. Nolan suggested that the initial activation should be set at 75% as a test run, with enforcement not occurring until 95%. Timón argued that setting the activation threshold at 95% would be safer and result in fewer orphaned blocks. However, Nolan warned against relying on nodes following the standard policy, as some may start applying restrictions in their own blocks at 0%, while others only at 90%. The discussion highlights the importance of achieving consensus among bitcoin users when making changes to the network.</p>
