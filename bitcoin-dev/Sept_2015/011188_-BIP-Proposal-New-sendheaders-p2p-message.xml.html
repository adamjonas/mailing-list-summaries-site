    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tier Nolan suggested that new nodes should unilaterally switch to sending headers instead of block announcements. However, Suhas Daftuar argued that this solution would not work for all network participants, including users running older Bitcoin Core versions (before 0.10) and non-Bitcoin Core software that may ignore headers messages. Peter Todd proposed that the behavior could be enabled based on advertised p2p network version, but Suhas Daftuar pointed out that other software on the network might prefer to bump up their protocol version in the future without having to opt-in to receiving headers-announcements for blocks. He also mentioned that inv-based block announcements are not going away and forcing all software on the network to upgrade to supporting headers announcements seems too drastic as some software may not be very concerned about optimizing block relay in this particular way.</p>
