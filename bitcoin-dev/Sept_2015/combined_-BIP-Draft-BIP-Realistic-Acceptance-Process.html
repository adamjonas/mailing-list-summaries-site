        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal suggests a BIP Realistic Acceptance Process to document the current method for accepting or rejecting BIPs. The author emphasizes that while BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin improvement proposal, it does not specify the exact method for which BIPs are accepted or rejected. The proposal outlines a game-like process that simulates the different stages of the BIP process, including drawing up an implementation, submitting it for comments on a mailing list, submitting a draft pull request to bitcoin/bip, submitting a pull request with implementation, and finally, a hard fork. Each stage has its own set of rules and requirements, which are detailed in the proposal.The proposal is based around the acceptance process of BIP-0064, which was chosen because it deals with many edge cases that BIPs often have. The author cites several prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, such as Luke Jr., Btc Drak, Peter Todd, and Adam Back, who have called for documenting and using the current "realistic" method for BIP acceptance. The proposal has been made public and aims to facilitate a discussion on a realistic and acceptable BIP acceptance procedure.</p>
