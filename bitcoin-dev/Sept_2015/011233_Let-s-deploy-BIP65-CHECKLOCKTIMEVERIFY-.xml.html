    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message posted on the Bitcoin Talk forum expresses no progress made on BIP 63. The poster also states that they still hold objections to XT as expressed on a previous list. They hope that developers can refine and adjust the BIPS, coming to an agreement on them before the end of the year. Adam Back via bitcoin-dev wonders what Gavin's views are, hoping he will support it. There is no consensus on using a soft fork to deploy this feature, and Mike Hearn is against it, stating that it will result in the same problems as all the other soft forks. He suggests making it a hard fork, and until then, as there is no consensus, you need to do one of two things: drop the "everyone must agree to make changes" idea or do nothing.</p>
