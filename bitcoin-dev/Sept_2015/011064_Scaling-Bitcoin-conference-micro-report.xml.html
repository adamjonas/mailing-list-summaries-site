    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been arguing over the block size limit. Dave Scotese has expressed disappointment that the conversation has been focused on numbers rather than fundamental issues such as consensus building and a unified vision for Bitcoin. Mark Friedenbach has disagreed with the idea of requiring a second hard fork, stating that a long-term growth curve is preferable to an exponential one. There was no consensus on any specific number increase, but there was general agreement that a "short term bump" is needed. One possible metric discussed was BTCDaysDestroyed (BTCDD).</p>
