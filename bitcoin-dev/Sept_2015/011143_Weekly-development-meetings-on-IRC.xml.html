    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When working on transglobal IT projects, one should keep in mind the effect of timezones on local mood and alertness. People in different parts of the world will have a different mindset depending on the time of day. It may be helpful to schedule meetings every other week at a time that is better for the "other" half. On September 18th, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed scheduling a regular developer meeting for Bitcoin in #bitcoin-dev. Attendance would be voluntary, but it would be useful to have a set time for people to discuss current issues. He asked for preferences on days and times, suggesting every Thursday at 15:00-16:00 UTC. A doodle poll was created by Jonasschnelli to determine the most popular time for the meeting. The results showed that Thursday at 19:00-20:00 UTC was the best time for attendees. Wladimir suggested scheduling the meeting in UTC (Iceland time) due to the complexity of different locales having different DST or no DST at all. While this may make a convenient time less convenient for some people half of the year, there is no time that works for everyone.</p>
