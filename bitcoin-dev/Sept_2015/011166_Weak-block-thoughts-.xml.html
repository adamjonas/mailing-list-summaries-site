    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Peter R discussed with Gavin the necessity of considering block propagation from the perspective of the block size limit, which was not mentioned by Gavin. Peter suggested that weak blocks are a good idea regardless of the limit. In terms of miners paying for the work, Peter stated that many companies have contributed to the Foundation and will contribute to the DCI. He believes that when there are stable and profitable companies, they will task their developers to contribute code. Peter also expressed his interest in optimizing new block propagation and plans on working on it.</p>
