        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Zach G starts an email thread by pointing out that AT&T does not offer a public static IP without payment. It is unclear which aspect of bitcoin development he is referring to. The sender of this email encountered difficulties in opening ports for Bitcoin on their AT&T network. This was due to the fact that AT&T Uverse customers are only given a private dynamic IP, which is hidden from the internet. Consequently, it becomes impossible to send requests.The suggested solution to this problem is to switch to a public static IP and allow incoming traffic. However, AT&T does not provide a public static IP without payment. This limitation has led to only 37 nodes using AT&T worldwide. Such a low number indicates the extreme difficulty faced by individuals trying to use Bitcoin Core as a full node on AT&T.Unfortunately, other major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) also engage in similar practices, causing a decline in the number of Bitcoin nodes overall. In light of these security measures, the author emphasizes the need for the community to educate users on how to navigate such obstacles when utilizing Bitcoin Core. Without proper education and awareness, the decline in node numbers is likely to persist.</p>
