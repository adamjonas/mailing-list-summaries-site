    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd raised concerns regarding the delay in the deployment of CLTV due to waiting for nVersion bits and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. It was proposed multiple times to wait until a single soft-fork with CSV using the nVersion bits mechanism can be done. However, nVersion bits does not have an implementation yet, and there is no solid consensus on how it should work. A small correction was made that the suggestion is to roll out CLTV+CSV together by 0.12 release, using IsSuperMajority() or versionbits if ready by then. If CSV is not ready, they would just roll out CLTV. The CSV related pull requests are now ready for final review, and if that happens soon, CLTV+CSV would be rolled out together before 0.12. The related PRs have gone through considerable time, discussion, and iterations, and they believe that they are at the point of consensus modulo final review before merging.</p>
