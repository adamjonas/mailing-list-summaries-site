    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jason Livesay, a member of Bitcoin Development team has suggested building a new system with the bitcoin name to maintain brand momentum, network, and business investment. He proposed that the new system should be packaged with the bitcoin core client and referred to as QuickBitcoin or qbtc, and work on top of traditional bitcoins but have a mechanism for more/faster transactions. Jason believes that the development team should not concern themselves with non-technical issues. Although some members have already started working on such a system, its future does not look promising. Retail spending still makes up only a small percentage of Bitcoin transactions, and there are no indications of any significant changes in retail spending this Christmas compared to last year.</p>
