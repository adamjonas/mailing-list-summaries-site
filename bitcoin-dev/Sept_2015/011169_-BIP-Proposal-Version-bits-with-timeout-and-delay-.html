    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Rusty Russell proposes that the consensus rules related to 'locked-in' soft fork will be enforced in the second retarget period. This means that there is one retarget period in which the remaining 5% can upgrade. After the activation block and onwards, bit B may be reused for a different soft fork. However, there is a concern that with a simple delay, support may fall off during the delay period, resulting in far below threshold support just moments prior to enforcement. To avoid this, a one-period "burn-in" is suggested, where support must continuously remain above the threshold, and any lapse resets to an inactivated state. It is noted that BIP 101 also faces this problem.</p>
