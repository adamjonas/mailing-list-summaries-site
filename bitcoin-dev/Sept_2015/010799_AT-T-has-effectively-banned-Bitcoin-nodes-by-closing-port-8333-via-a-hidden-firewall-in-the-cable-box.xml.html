    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer had been struggling to get port 8333 open all year and after numerous phone calls, AT&T finally revealed what was going on. The writer also had a similar issue with Comcast involving another port which resulted in the writer testifying in federal court as part of a class action lawsuit against them. The solution for the writer was to get a business account rather than a residential one, which allows for firewall configuration and no blocked ports. The cost was an extra $10 per month. Bitnodes.io was suggested as a potential resource to see if any ISPs are blocking nodes, and the writer has been running a node through their business account for some time.</p>
