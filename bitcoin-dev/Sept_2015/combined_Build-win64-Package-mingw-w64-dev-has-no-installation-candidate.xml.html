        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>An email conversation between Joseph Bisch and Roy Osherove revealed that the TeamCity setup was using Ubuntu Trusty for the build, while Travis CI was using Ubuntu Precise. This caused an issue as the mingw-w64-dev package was only available in Precise. The email also mentioned that the package had been split into mingw-w64-x86-64-dev and mingw-w64-i686-dev, both of which needed to be used with Ubuntu Trusty. Relevant links were provided about the different packages and operating systems.A user is attempting to recreate the Travis CI build system using TeamCity to learn more about bitcoin builds but is encountering issues getting mingw dev during Windows builds. The message "Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no installation candidate" appears despite using the same exports env vars as the Travis script and even using the Travis script within TeamCity. The PPA seems to import fine during the build. The agent runs inside a docker image based on Ubuntu. The user shared the full log of the failed build and is seeking suggestions on why it works on Travis but not on the TeamCity build agent. The same issue also occurs in the win32 build. In the end, the user thanks everyone and shares their contact details.</p>
