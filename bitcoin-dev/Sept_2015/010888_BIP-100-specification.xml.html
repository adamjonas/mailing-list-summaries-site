    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the rollout of BIP 100, a hard fork that would allow for an increase in block size. One member of the community questions why certain topics are being avoided. Another member suggests avoiding discussion of deployment methodologies and focusing on functionality to ensure a quick inclusion. The discussion continues with comments on the proposed 75% rule, which some believe is meaningless since there are no invalid version four blocks. There is also a debate over the unclear implication threshold, with one member arguing for a high threshold of 95% to prevent attacks on the original fork, while another argues that such a high threshold may be difficult to achieve and prefers a lower threshold of 80%. Additionally, it is suggested that using the 20-percentile rather than the median creates an incentive for 51% attacks. The idea of making the thresholds for increasing and decreasing block size symmetrical is also discussed. Finally, a link is provided for the initial public draft of BIP 100, with the emphasis being on the fact that this is just a starting point for open source feedback and iteration.</p>
