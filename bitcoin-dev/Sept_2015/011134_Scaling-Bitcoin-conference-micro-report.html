    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author, Mike, suggests that while Obama would like to restrict guns due to their popularity in the USA, governments tolerate black markets because they believe Bitcoin can have great benefits for their ordinary voters. He argues that these two reasons must be recognized for their differences and questions why the government assumes some things are bad for people despite their popularity. He compares this to the concern of parents for their children and their responsibility to determine if a popular thing provides great benefits. Mike then provides historical resources to study the origination of public schooling, the idea of a state, and the role of laws and enforcement. These include works by Johann Fichte, Franz Oppenheimer, Carroll Quigley, Larken Rose, Plato's The Republic, and John Taylor Gatto's five-hour interview titled "The Ultimate History Lesson." The author identifies as "notplato" and encourages critical thinking about institutional power structures.</p>
