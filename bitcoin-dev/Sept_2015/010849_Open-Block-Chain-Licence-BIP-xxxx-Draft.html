    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ahmed Zsales has proposed a draft BIP for discussion and evaluation regarding the need for a block chain license to supplement the existing MIT License, which only covers the core reference client software. The proposal aims to address issues of copyright ownership and licensing for data existing before a license change. The document suggests that miners be the main beneficiaries of licensing and there is consideration on whether they should vote to adopt the new terms. The proposal acknowledges the potential rabbit holes that may arise with this train of thought but believes the changes would be considered effective on a retrospective basis. However, without commenting on the proposal, Btc Drak raises concerns about licensing after the fact as it requires the permission of every copyright holder in order to make the change. The email includes links to the draft BIP for further information.</p>
