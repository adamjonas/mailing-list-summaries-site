    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message discusses the idea of creating multiple implementations for Bitcoin Core, which is open-source and free. The author states that controversial changes represent a threat to the entire ecosystem and that gains and risks must be carefully balanced. The author suggests that centralised mining represents a bigger problem than the full nodes running Bitcoin Core software. A response by Peter R proposes the creation of multiple implementations, similar to what Bitcoin XT did, with each group having an incentive to remain compatible with other implementations. Peter R suggests working together to never reach consensus with Bitcoin Core, which would provide impetus for new implementations to fork from Core, allowing for creative destruction.</p>
