        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article emphasizes the importance of establishing a threat model for Bitcoin to prioritize development efforts. The proposed threat model specifies which adversaries pose a threat, what they can do, and why they want to attack. It prioritizes rational individuals and small groups motivated by profit, followed by the "global passive adversary" motivated by a desire to map bitcoin transactions to people in bulk. However, the exclusion of many types of government adversary is controversial due to their effective ways of interfering with Bitcoin that cannot be addressed.The article also provides examples of attackers that would be considered in-scope and out-of-scope for the proposed threat model. The article clarifies that the goal of the model is not to predict the future but to help prioritize development efforts. By establishing a clear threat model, it will help focus on other threats that can be better managed or improve usability or features.Overall, the article highlights the significance of identifying and assessing potential threats to Bitcoin. By creating a threat model, developers can prioritize their efforts towards mitigating these risks and enhancing the security and functionality of the system.</p>
