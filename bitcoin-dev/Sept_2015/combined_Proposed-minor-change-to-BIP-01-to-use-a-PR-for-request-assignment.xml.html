        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process has seen some difficulty in auditing assignments due to changes in how BIPs are stored and presented. Gregory Maxwell, a contributor to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, proposed changing the process for requesting a number assignment for BIPs. He suggested opening a pull request with the BIP text, using the author's name and an index as the number, as the new mechanism for requesting number assignments. The current process in BIP01 was written when a different solution was used for storing and presenting BIPs. Maxwell requested that any responses be strictly directed to whether or not anyone finds the proposal objectionable and that a new thread be started for any other subject matter. Eric suggested a special label to indicate number requests, while Marco Pontello stated that he couldn't see any issues with the current process but needed more details. The email thread discusses the use of GitHub for BIP and how it has caused some confusion with numbering assignments. In conclusion, the author is considering suggesting a change in the number request process to open a pull request with BIP text without a number, using only the author's name and an index as the number, as the mechanism to request number assignment. The message concludes by requesting that any response should strictly address the question and not digress into another subject. The provided context is a PGP signed message with the signature of Douglas Roark, who is a Senior Developer at Armory Technologies, Inc.</p>
