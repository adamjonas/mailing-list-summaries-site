    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Simon Liu questioned the proposed counting of non-votes as votes for the current hard limit in BIP 100. He argued that non-voters should have no impact on the result and that counting them anyway would encourage a lack of participation among miners at a time when their involvement is crucial. Similarly, he questioned the counting of out-of-range votes, stating that they are invalid and should be discarded. Another participant in the discussion, Oliver, agreed with Simon's sentiments and suggested dropping non-votes altogether rather than counting them as votes. However, he saw no issue with counting out-of-range votes as the nearest in-range value and found them interesting if they began to lean heavily in either direction. The discussion took place in response to the initial public draft of BIP 100 proposed by Jeff Garzik.</p>
