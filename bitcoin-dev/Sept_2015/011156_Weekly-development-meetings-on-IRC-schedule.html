    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development discussion, Wladimir J. van der Laan suggested weekly IRC meetings, which were agreed upon by the group. However, participants from Asia and Australia expressed concerns about the meeting time being inconvenient for them due to the time difference. In response to this, a suggestion was made to shift the meeting time to 23:00 to 00:00 UTC, which would be more feasible for people in Asia. It was acknowledged that accommodating everyone's preferences is difficult, but a monthly meeting at a suitable time might work. The proposed time change was open for feedback from people in Asia and Australia. A shared Google calendar was created with the meeting time of Thursday 19:00-20:00 UTC every week starting from September 24. The calendar can be added to individual calendars to show the meeting time in their respective time zones.</p>
