        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>It is generally not recommended to use an ISP-provided router for anything other than modem functionality, as ISPs often prohibit network services that a full node would provide from a residence. This can result in difficulties for users trying to open ports necessary for operating a full node. Comcast forbids such services, while AT&T claims implicit admin rights to all equipment connecting to their network.One user struggled to open port 8333 essential for operating a full node, and it was revealed that the internet was being routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall. The customer service representative refused to disable the firewall, enabling them to firewall any port they wanted even if the customer asked them not to.Bitnodes.io is a useful resource that shows whether ISPs are blocking nodes. A potential solution to avoid blockage and censorship could be for those with an AT&T landline but who don't use AT&T's standard internet/tv offering to use a local ISP instead. Furthermore, many ISPs retain data on users for extended periods, with AT&T retaining data for over a year. Using a VPN can provide privacy and flexibility to open or close any ports.The writer faced issues with port 8333 and another port involving Comcast, which led to testifying in federal court as part of a class action lawsuit against them. The solution for the writer was getting a business account rather than a residential one, which allows for firewall configuration and no blocked ports at an extra cost of $10 per month. They have been running a node through their business account for some time.In conclusion, the message highlights the issue of ISPs censoring Bitcoin by blocking ports essential for operating a full node. The author suggests various solutions, such as using a local ISP, setting up a VPN, and avoiding using an ISP-provided router. The message also includes an excerpt from Zach G via bitcoin-dev, who faced similar issues with opening port 8333. Overall, the message serves as a warning to Bitcoin users about potential censorship and the importance of taking necessary measures to protect their network. The legality of setting up a full node for Bitcoin from home remains contentious. It is clear that ISPs play a significant role in the decline of Bitcoin nodes by censoring the currency themselves.</p>
