    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation begins with a comment about the importance of a proper threat model considering all possible threats and their probability. The author accuses the recipient of posting "wing nut stuff" without regard for the discussion at hand. The recipient previously commented on trusting governments, citing recent history of conflict justified by fake evidence, disregard for law and human rights, and global surveillance. A third party then enters the conversation, expressing their dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity in Bitcoin's direction. They question how things will become settled when it is perceived that a small group of developers and miners control the decisions. The email includes links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list where these comments were posted.</p>
