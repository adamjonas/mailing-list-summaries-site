    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a member expressed their belief that consensus rule changes do not need to be coupled with major releases. They suggest that there is no issue with making them minor releases if they are not ready in time for a major release. Another member, Luke Dashjr, raised concerns about the lack of a "Consensus freeze" and suggested it should be put off until after the HK workshop in case a hardfork is decided on. He also questioned whether it had been de-coupled from the release process entirely. The conversation took place in September 2015 and was part of ongoing discussions around updates to the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
