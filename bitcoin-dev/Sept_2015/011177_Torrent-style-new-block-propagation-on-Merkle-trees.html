    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to improve the block propagation algorithm in the blockchain. The current algorithm is slow and requires a peer to have the full block before uploading to other peers. A new algorithm was proposed using Bittorrent as an example. The proposal suggests that the seed node will mine a block, notify peers of the new block and send out the block header. Leech peers will then verify the block header, request the nth row of the transaction merkle tree, and receive leaves from the seed node. Once the leeches confirm PoW and hash/data integrity, they begin to upload chunks of data instead of waiting for a fully copied block. The proposed algorithm is more complicated but provides several points for bandwidth saving and optimization by caching transactions and reconstructing the transaction order. The proposal also addresses how the actual transaction data will be obtained once the leech has the list of txn hashes.In another discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user jtoomim proposed the idea of using a protocol to supply resources in a parallelized and decentralized manner. It is not clear what specific resources jtoomim is referring to, but it can be assumed that this proposal could potentially improve efficiency and distribution of said resources. The discussion remains ongoing.</p>
