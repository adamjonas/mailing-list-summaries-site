    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ken Shirriff proposed the addition of the B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to Unicode, as the current use of the bitcoin symbol in text is inconvenient due to its absence from the Unicode standard. The proposal aims to avoid confusion with the Thai baht currency symbol, which is a B with a single vertical bar. However, Danny Thorpe suggested using the already available B-with-horizontal-bar (Éƒ) symbol as it is already in the Unicode glyph set and available on most Unicode enabled devices. The argument against this was that using the Thai baht currency symbol for Bitcoin leads to confusion. The bitcoin symbol needs to be added to Unicode to avoid confusion with other symbols and enable everyone to use the standard symbol. Adding a character to Unicode was seen as a long and complicated process, but Ken Shirriff has successfully proposed a new character before and thinks that this proposal has a good chance of succeeding. Endorsement by Bitcoin developers will help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol.</p>
