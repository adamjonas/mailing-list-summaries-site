    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Andy Chase proposed a system to solve the issue of who makes high-level Bitcoin decisions. Peter Todd responded that such a system was unnecessary and that market forces should decide instead. He argued that attempting to set up a system in the current environment would be a bureaucratic waste of time. Todd believed that no amount of words on paper could change the fact that people cannot be forced to run software they do not want to run. He stated that the formal part of the BIP process is simply a convenience and the rest of the process will always be fuzzy, situation-specific, and generally undefined. Todd concluded by saying that even if the proposed process were created, it would fall apart quickly if relevant stakeholders disagreed with the BIPs approved by committees.</p>
