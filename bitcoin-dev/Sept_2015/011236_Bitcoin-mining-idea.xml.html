    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Neil Haran proposes to build the largest rock paper scissors tournament ever seen, using bitcoin-qt. The tournament is envisioned to be like the World Series of Poker but for RPS. Each player will play a best-of-five tournament each round with players randomly matched against each other. The number of rounds would effectively be the depth of a binary tree. For instance, if a million people enter the tournament, they would need to win 20 rounds to win the cash prize that Neil is offering. Neil also mentions he has media connections to get coverage for this, and fully believes he could get millions playing in this tournament.</p>
