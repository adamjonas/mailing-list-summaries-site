        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers discussed the timing of weekly IRC meetings in September 2015. Vincent Truong proposed a meeting time from 23:00 to 00:00 UTC that could work for accommodating the US and Asia, but it may not be convenient for everyone. He suggested having the meeting once a month on the first week and running every other week on the main schedule. Wladimir J. van der Laan created a shared Google Calendar for the meetings on Thursdays at 19:00-20:00 UTC starting from September 24, 2015, with the timezone in Reykyavik (Iceland) which is UTC+0. A suitable time slot, Thursday 19:00-20:00 UTC, was selected using the Doodle site and it was confirmed that everyone who voted is available at that time. The first meeting will take place on September 24th and will continue every week thereafter. A shared Google Calendar has been created for this purpose, but its timezone is Reykyavik (Iceland) which is UTC+0. However, users can add the calendar to their own calendars and view the meeting in their own timezone by clicking on the button in the lower right corner.Participants from Asia and Australia expressed concerns about the meeting time being inconvenient for them due to the time difference. In response to this, a suggestion has been made to shift the meeting time to 23:00 to 00:00 UTC, which would be more feasible for people in Asia. It was acknowledged that accommodating everyone's preferences is difficult, but a monthly meeting at a suitable time might work. A suggestion was made to review the timing of meetings on a weekly or monthly basis to ensure that everyone is able to attend. Additionally, some have requested an agenda be published before each meeting to determine if it is worth attending, particularly for those who will need to wake up in the middle of the night to participate.Jl2012 asked if there would be an agenda published before the bitcoin-dev meetings. The IRC channel for bitcoin-dev is logged at bitcoinstats.com.</p>
