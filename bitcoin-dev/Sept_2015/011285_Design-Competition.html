    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 30, 2015, Richard Olsen via bitcoin-dev sent a message to the mailing list announcing a Bitcoin-related competition. The aim of the competition was to build a trading platform initially for foreign exchange, with other assets to follow, which enables participants to settle their trades through the blockchain via colored coins. Although the use of a sidechain was suggested, it was not necessary. An online briefing event was held to outline the requirements in more detail, and much of it was posted on the website www.lykkex.com. The competition aimed to be community-driven rather than turning into proprietary technology. All contributions were made available under an MIT license on Github. However, there was no information given about who was funding this competition and why core development was not being funded.</p>
