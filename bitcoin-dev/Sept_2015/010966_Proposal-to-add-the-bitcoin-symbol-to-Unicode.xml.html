    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ken Shirriff proposed to add the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to Unicode, as the current use of the bitcoin symbol in text is inconvenient due to its absence from Unicode. The proposal can be found at <a href="http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf">http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf</a>. Shirriff has successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before and thinks this has a good chance of succeeding. However, he received a suggestion to run this proposal by the Bitcoin-dev group, so he hopes his email is appropriate here. Endorsement by Bitcoin developers will help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol. The B-with-2-vertical-bars is easily confused with the Thai Bhat currency symbol, which is a B with a single vertical bar. Bitcoinsymbol.org previously proposed B-with-horizontal-bar (Éƒ), which is already in the Unicode glyph set and available on most Unicode enabled devices. Danny, however, is not fond of B-with-horizontal-bar as a symbol.</p>
