        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Lykke Corp, a trading platform for foreign exchange, is funding a Bitcoin-related competition aimed at building a trading platform that allows participants to settle their trades through the blockchain via colored coins. The competition, which will initially focus on foreign exchange, aims to create a community-driven effort rather than proprietary technology. The use of a sidechain is suggested but not required for trade reconciliation. Participants in the competition will receive 2 million Lykke coins ($8,000 USD) allocated for core development over the next three months. More details on the requirements can be found on the Lykke website. Richard Olsen, CEO of Lykke, encourages questions to be asked during an online briefing event or over email.In response to the announcement of the competition, one member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list questions why the funds are not being used to fund Core development instead. Another member suggests that the Bitcointalk Altcoin section would be the best place for announcements regarding such projects. The original poster expresses their desire for a dedicated mailing list that is not solely focused on digital cash systems and welcomes discussions about 2.0 projects. Benjamin, another member of the mailing list, believes there is room for a better board/list for new 2.0 projects and offers to help build it.The competition, announced by Richard Olsen, seeks participants to build a trading platform using colored coins on the blockchain for settling trades. The competition is community-driven and contributions will be made available under an MIT license on Github. Although the use of a sidechain is suggested, it is not mandatory. The competition will initially focus on foreign exchange, with other assets to follow. Interested parties can attend an online briefing event or visit www.lykkex.com for more information. Contributions will be made available under an MIT license on Github to foster a community-driven project.In a post on Bitcoin-dev, Eric Lombrozo highlights the issue of finding developers for new services in the Bitcoin ecosystem. While some proposals receive significant interest if made by well-known individuals, others are dismissed as spam or ridiculed if coming from unknown sources. The author suggests creating a list where people can discuss proposed and ongoing projects and look for developers to hire.Overall, the discussion revolves around the need for a more open mailing list for Bitcoin and the announcement of a Bitcoin trading platform competition. The competition aims to build a trading platform for foreign exchange and other assets using colored coins and potentially a sidechain. The contributions made will be available under an MIT license on Github. Participants will have the opportunity to settle their trades through the blockchain.</p>
