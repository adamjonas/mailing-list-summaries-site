        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Scotese proposed a more sophisticated method for choosing which of two block solutions to accept. He suggested using the criterion of the block with more work (in valid blocks) on top of it instead of relying on the first-seen block. However, there is confusion about how to determine which of 2 blocks with the same height is newer, and it is suggested to disambiguate this in the future. Vincent Truong expressed concerns about how this could alter the prioritization of transactions in order to win, potentially resulting in a bad outcome for Bitcoin's fungibility. To avoid allowing miners to use private transactions to manipulate the blockchain and make empty blocks less attractive, the proposal suggests a weighted sum of BTCDD, where transactions earlier received are given higher weights. The Bitcoin transaction fee is calculated based on BTCDD, which is directly proportional to the age and value of inputs divided by transaction size in bytes. This new heuristic could lead miners to safely mine a sibling block instead of a child block when a new block with the most work is seen and there are no ties. However, it also opens up the possibility for miners to double-spend some confirmed transactions and orphan a small non-empty block whenever the block confirming them is easily replaced. This issue can be fixed by preferring non-empty blocks to empty ones or only switching if the new block doesn't double spend transactions in the old one. The proposal suggests a new heuristic for miners to choose between two valid blocks they receive, which is to compare the Bitcoin Days Destroyed (BTCDD) of transactions already present in their mempool and weigh it so that older transactions are more important. This would increase Bitcoin stability by making it easier for clients to decide which block is valid when they see two competing with each other, motivating miners to add transactions instead of mining empty blocks, decreasing the utility of any global private network of nodes intended to spread selfishly-mined blocks, and motivating miners to stay well-connected so that they get transactions quickly. The heuristics are most useful when the two blocks are received within a small window of time, opting for the first-seen rule otherwise. It is proposed that this should be set as default behavior since most miners leave the defaults alone, and the benefits don't materialize unless a majority follows the policy. However, the proposal is a policy that everyone would be free to ignore, and it doesn't benefit miners unless they are trying to do selfish mining. The discussion in this context revolves around improving the security and efficiency of the Bitcoin network by proposing a new method for prioritizing transactions. While there are some concerns raised regarding the long-term benefits for miners and the issue of determining the newer block when two blocks have the same height, the proposal has been generally well-received and encouraged for implementation.</p>
