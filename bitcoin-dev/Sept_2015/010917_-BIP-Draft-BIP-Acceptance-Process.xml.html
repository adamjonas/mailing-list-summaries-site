    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development community email thread, Luke Dashjr responded to a proposal by Andy Chase for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) on governance. Dashjr argued that there is no governance in Bitcoin and any BIP needs to document the natural forces involved in real-world acceptance, instead of laying down rules that people are expected to follow. He suggests that hardforks require economic consensus, softforks require miner majority, and for anything else, real-world implementation and use by any significant quantity of people is necessary. The goal is to take the hodgepodge of current acceptance and apply rules that allow true acceptance to be identified in a clearer way. However, if people don't follow the rules, then the system won't work.</p>
