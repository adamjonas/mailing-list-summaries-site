    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this email is asking whether people are tired of hearing about block size issues and if they think it's time to move on from these discussions. They suggest that while scalability is important, people should stop talking about it so that other features can be discussed. The author also questions the amount of money spent on conferences and suggests there should be a more direct way of purchasing information. The author then introduces their solution to improving the discussion around block size issues, which involves using a method advocated by Hal Finney seven years ago. The solution is already coded into the author's own project, Truthcoin, but they invite competent C++ developers to talk with them for 30 minutes and potentially complete the coding in one weekend. More details about the project can be found on the Bitcoin Block Size website and technical details are available on Github. The author has also created a Slack channel for further discussions on the topic.</p>
