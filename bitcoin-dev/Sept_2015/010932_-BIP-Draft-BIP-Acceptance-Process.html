    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal aims to define a system that makes finding "acceptance" in a clear and fair way for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP). The current process is undefined, and acceptance is based on an undefined system. The goal of the proposal is to solve the issues of ensuring that a proposal is widely accepted or rejected, preventing deadlock, and receiving feedback systematically. The proposal provides an answer to what it means to "accept" a BIP. It allows client implementations, users, miners, and merchants to feel safe implementing and using a feature that has clear acceptance. The proposal suggests a system where everyone has a say, and clear acceptance can be reached by balancing the powers. However, there are pros and cons to using committees. Committees are used today in many fields with a range of success, and they can filter a range of opinions down to a yes/no. But, there is a fear of committees working in the dark, censoring opinions and centralization of power. Another possible approach suggested is micro votes, where each user can represent themselves, but there are concerns about how to prove and prevent manipulation and only motivated people contributing.Although there have been recent flood of BIPs added with zero bureaucracy or friction, this proposal is designed around the assumption that participation is voluntary. This means that without an organization managing the process, it's up to each individual reader of each BIP/Opinions set to make the decision on whether or not there is clear and true community acceptance. The author believes that the best approach would be to motivate committees to produce the best opinion they can and proof of stake.</p>
