    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Justus Ranvier challenged the understanding of another member's use of the term "decentralized." The other member had described decentralized as a system without the trust of third parties to process electronic payments. Justus asked for clarification on what it meant to use a decentralized network instead of a trusted third party and whether there were any undesirable actions that a trusted third party could perform that a decentralized network could not. He pointed out that a third party or a reduced group of miners controlling the majority of the hashrate could censor transactions regardless of their benevolence due to the laws of their jurisdiction. Moreover, he suggested starting a new system without expensive proof of work using block signing instead (which can still be multisig), for those who do not care about censorship.</p>
