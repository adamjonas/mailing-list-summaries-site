    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has been trying to get port 8333 open all year, but despite his efforts, it remains closed. He has spent an entire day attempting to resolve the issue and even confirmed that it was open on the router and computer, but it remained closed. After contacting AT&T, he discovered that the internet was being routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall which is why the port remains closed. However, the company refused to turn off the firewall as it is their equipment, which means they can firewall any port they want, regardless of customer request. The author believes this could be the reason for the decline in Bitcoin nodes, as ISPs are censoring the cryptocurrency without informing customers. To receive a proper answer, the author had to reach out to headquarters and threaten to remove the equipment from the wall.</p>
