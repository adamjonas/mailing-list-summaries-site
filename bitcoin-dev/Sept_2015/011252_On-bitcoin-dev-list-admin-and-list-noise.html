    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is intended for discussing ongoing development issues related to the protocol and its instantiation in bitcoin core. It was not meant to be a platform for holding the bitcoin development community accountable for its actions. Some developers have switched to digest-only or unsubscribed due to concerns that the list could become a channel for PR and populist venting, which could decrease the utility of the list by expanding its scope. A member expressed concern that the mailing list is one of the last uncensored persisted forums related to technical bitcoin discussion with wide viewership. They worry that it may become increasingly difficult for an average somewhat technical person to attempt to hold the bitcoin development community accountable for its actions or have their voice heard. The member also questions who will draw the line on debates over bitcoin philosophy and broader context being considered off-topic on the mailing list.</p>
