    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context involves a debate about increasing the block size to 20MB and the assumption that there are only two numbers, zero and infinity. The proposal, BIP101, tops out at 8 gigabyte blocks which would represent extremely high transaction rates compared to today. The author believes that it is important to consider the time dimension in these decisions as Bitcoin will not last forever and one day it will be replaced by something better. The author goes along with BIP101 because it is still the only proposal that is both reasonable and implemented, but notes that he would have been happy with no upper limit at all.</p>
