    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about scaling Bitcoin, a user suggests that the goal is to accommodate a larger user base and increase transactions per second, while maintaining security against government control. However, another user points out that simply growing the user base will not protect against governments if there are still chokepoints that can be targeted. Even if Bitcoin's user base were to grow by a small factor, it would not do much in the fight against governmental threats. The real need is to increase the number of participating nodes on the network, including miners and validators, but centralizing these activities makes it easier for governments to clamp down. If critical pieces of the network infrastructure are taken down, Bitcoin will fail and most people will continue using fiat currency without any significant impact on their daily lives.</p>
