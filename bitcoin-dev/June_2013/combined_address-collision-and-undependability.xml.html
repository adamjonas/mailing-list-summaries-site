        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Cryptocurrency addresses are not always effectively protected against single character errors or transpositions. This was demonstrated by the fact that certain valid addresses differ by only one character, such as 1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCWNXmHKW and 1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCxNXmHKW. Similarly, some addresses differ by only one transposition, such as 1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN781jjwLY and 1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN718jjwLY.A discussion on Bitcoin-dev revealed that it is impractical to generate two Bitcoin addresses that differ in exactly one character modulo different checksums. This means that if an address has a verifiable signature, changing one character of that address would render it undependable due to the lack of a known private key.</p>
