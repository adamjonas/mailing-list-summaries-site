        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2013, an email conversation discussed the idea of implementing a voting system for determining the block size limit in Bitcoin. Melvin Carvalho proposed a Proof-of-Stake vote, where each txout in the UTXO set would be one vote weighted by txout value. The upper limit on the block size would be determined by the median of all votes. However, there were concerns about coercion and vote buying under this system. The email communication also addressed other issues related to the block size limit in Bitcoin, such as the fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin being "one CPU one vote" versus a zero-trust system where rules are set and verified by every full node independently. There were also discussions about the implementation of a voting system for block size limit increases and concerns about sudden changes in votes.Different proposals were suggested, but there were still concerns about potential flaws in these systems. Pieter Wuille clarified that while Bitcoin is not a democracy, it is a consensus system at both the technical level and the people using it, meaning they ultimately decide the rules.Overall, the implementation of a voting process could ensure that any increase to the block size genuinely represented the desires of the Bitcoin community and happened at a rate that gave all participants time to react. The proposed proof-of-stake voting system for protocol soft-forks could balance the asymmetrical power relationship between miners and Bitcoin participants, but challenges of preventing coercion and vote buying remained.One major problem with the proposed proof-of-stake voting system for protocol soft-forks is that those with the most stake are unlikely to go through the effort of signing votes, as their private keys are likely behind super-secure accessibility barriers. The email conversation also discusses the issue of long-term storage of large amounts of money, which requires a secure voting system to sign votes. However, revealing one's public key is a concern, as it increases exposure and risk of quantum computers breaking encryption earlier than expected. One proposal suggests adding an opcode called "OP_VOTE" and executing a code-path in the script for that specific key.The conversation also discusses the idea of implementing a voting system to increase the blocksize limit in Bitcoin. The author points out that while it may be hard to say if a proof-of-stake vote is representative, it is likely the closest thing to a fair vote and certainly better than just letting miners choose.In summary, the email conversation proposes a proof-of-stake voting system for determining the blocksize limit in Bitcoin, with each txout in the UTXO set being one vote weighted by txout value. The rolling median and periodic reset process ensure that changes happen gradually and are not influenced by temporary events such as hacks or malicious wallet software. While coercion and vote buying are possible in this system, it ensures that any increase to the blocksize genuinely represents the desires of the Bitcoin community. The conversation also discusses various concerns and potential solutions related to long-term storage of large amounts of money and implementing a voting system for bug fixes and protocol optimization.</p>
