    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 email discussion, Arthur Gervais raised the issue of signature encoding differences between Bitcoin versions and the potential consequences for merchants who accept zero-confirmation transactions. However, Jeff Garzik pointed out that it is becoming increasingly difficult to relay older versions of transactions due to changes in P2P network node version distributions. Garzik also noted that merchants who accept zero confirmation transactions are likely already aware of the risks involved and make a business decision accordingly. While small digital downloads may be accepted at zero confirmation, larger transactions such as those involving Porsches, houses, or bitcoin exchange deposits are less likely to be processed without confirmation.</p>
