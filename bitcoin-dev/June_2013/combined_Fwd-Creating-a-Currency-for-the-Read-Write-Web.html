        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Melvin Carvalho came up with an idea of creating a currency for the read-write web by blending the features of bitcoin and ripple. Bitcoin is a distributed ledger where each subject acts as a primary key in the ledger and can hold any number of coins, whereas Ripple is a protocol used to conduct financial transactions between two parties using a path of credit extensions. Melvin suggested using portable URIs for addresses, maintaining a distributed database using read/write web technologies such as HTTP POST/PATCH or SPARQL Update, and adding signatures using the WebKeys spec.He also talked about the obstacles associated with maintaining a distributed database and proposed using proof of work and consensus based on a unique node list to mitigate race conditions. Coin creation would be proportional to those who maintain the integrity of the shared database, and a transaction fee would prioritize those who pay the highest fee. Additionally, he proposed adding a trust and reputation system to promote honest nodes and encourage unexpected reuse of linked data and extensibility.Melvin invited criticisms and interest in running a node to get a reference implementation going as proof of concept. The proposal involves creating a new currency that combines the features of existing digital currencies and technologies to create a more efficient and reliable system for conducting financial transactions.</p>
