    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between John Dillon and Peter Todd on June 28, 2013, they discussed the need for encrypted node-to-node connections to protect against network-wide passive sniffing. They also noted that Bitmessage doesn't encrypt node-to-node communications, which could be a serious oversight that allows attackers like the NSA to track down the originating node of any message. The discussion then shifted to replace-by-fee rules and miners' usage of them. Todd and Dillon found that about 0.25% of hashing power was following replace-by-fee rules, and they believed advertising money being given away by such a tx generator in the mining forum would encourage more miners to use it. However, Todd emphasized the need for solid mempool support for the "scorched-earth" double-spend countermeasure before implementing this. Instead, he recommended adding recursive fee evaluation with a depth*breadth anti-DoS limit, better wallet support for conflicts, and preferential peering through service bits. Todd explained that preferential peering would set aside a portion of outgoing peer slots for peers with certain bits set and only fill those slots with those peers. DNS seeds could also return peers with specified service bits set.</p>
