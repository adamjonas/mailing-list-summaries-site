    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from June 10, 2013, John Dillon and Melvin Carvalho discuss Bitcoin's philosophy of "one CPU one vote" and how it has been affected by the introduction of GPUs and ASICs. Dillon points out that Satoshi Nakamoto was against the use of GPUs and did not foresee mining pools, which have resulted in just a few people controlling the majority of Bitcoin hashing power. Carvalho suggests that sticking with "one CPU one vote" is important unless there is a clear reason not to, such as if miners are abusing the system. Dillon agrees but notes that there must be balance in giving miners control over block size while also allowing for auditing of the blocks they produce. The email concludes with a PGP signature.</p>
