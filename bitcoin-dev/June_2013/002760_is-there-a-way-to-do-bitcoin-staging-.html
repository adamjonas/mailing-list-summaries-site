    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2013, Adam Back proposed a way to experiment with new bitcoin features without imposing security and testing risks on the main network. He suggested creating an altcoin, called "bitcoin-staging," that uses the same coins as bitcoin but has no native mining. Instead, its mining power would go to the bitcoin main network through merged mining. The coins could be exchanged 1:1 cryptographically between the two networks without the need for a traditional exchange. This system would allow for real-world testing of new features with live value while avoiding forking bitcoin's parameters or diluting its mindshare. Ripple was also mentioned as a possible transfer system between the two networks. By cherry-picking interesting patches from bitcoin-staging after real-world validation, the main network could adopt successful new features with less risk.</p>
