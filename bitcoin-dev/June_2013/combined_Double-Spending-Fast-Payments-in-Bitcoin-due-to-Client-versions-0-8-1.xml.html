        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On June 27, 2013, Arthur Gervais reported a vulnerability in Bitcoin which may lead to a double-spending attack. The vulnerability was caused due to signature encoding incompatibilities between versions 0.8.2 (or 0.8.3) and earlier versions of Bitcoin. According to the report, this vulnerability is not related to fees or dust and it is not necessary to send two double-spending transactions at the same time. It was observed that the double-spending still works if the second transaction is sent after minutes and the first transaction has not yet been included into a block.The report further states that this vulnerability affects any non-standard transaction, including those based on dust, and creates inconsistency in forwarding. The same code is executed and the same behavior is observed for any case of a non-standard transaction being used to achieve inconsistent forwarding. The intention of the report is to raise awareness among merchants who have to accept zero-confirmation transactions.The report also highlights that mining and relay behavior inhomogeneity exists in the network, even for new reference client software that changes IsStandard. This results in higher success rates and can be important since some services may only be profitable exploited with a high enough success rate.The report includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, which can be found at ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch/pub/publications/tech-reports/7xx/789.pdf. However, it is noted that the family of transaction patterns described in the report is one of the examples of why taking non-reversible actions on unconfirmed transactions is unsafe. It is recommended to refer to prior discussions of this transaction pattern and to be cautious when focusing on signature encoding differences to avoid creating misunderstandings.</p>
