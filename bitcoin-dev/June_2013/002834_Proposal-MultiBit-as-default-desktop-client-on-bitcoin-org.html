    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion centers around the Multibit wallet and its features. Jeff Garzik argues that multibit should not be the default wallet. Greg Maxwell mentions that deadlocking problems have been resolved in the Wallet and discusses proxy support and change address behavior. Luke-Jr adds that he doubts Multibit will participate in the Bitcoin network other than as an SPV client due to its optimization for reducing data traffic, while Alex notes that most users migrate to Blockchain.info or Coinbase.com but would like to keep Bitcoin as P2P as possible. The ratio of full nodes to SPV nodes is discussed with no analysis having been done yet. Finally, the nomenclature for direction of transactions is mentioned, and the email ends with a link to the Multibit website.</p>
