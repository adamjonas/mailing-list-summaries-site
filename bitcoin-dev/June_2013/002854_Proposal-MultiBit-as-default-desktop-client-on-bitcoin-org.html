    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developer of MultiBit has increased the support for the cryptocurrency wallet by providing a dedicated support page on their website with fixes and support notes for common issues. The in-app help now includes a 'Support' section with troubleshooting tips, and more help has been written to cover as much as possible. If users are unable to find solutions through these resources, they are directed to bitcoin.stackexchange.com or the Github issues page to search for existing problems or raise new ones. The developer and others are actively involved in addressing issues on Github. In an email thread from 2013, it was suggested that MultiBit should replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app due to its user-friendliness.</p>
