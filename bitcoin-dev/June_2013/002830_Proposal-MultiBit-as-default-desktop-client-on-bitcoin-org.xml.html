    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jim is proposing the promotion of a fast SPV desktop wallet, and is seeking feedback on this idea. However, there were issues with the wallet when it was previously tested, such as frequent deadlocks that were said to be fixed by Mike. Despite this, other concerns remain uncorrected, including no proxy support for users to follow best practices of using it with Tor, address reuse (especially for change), and unclear confirmation levels. Additionally, the wallet makes repeated HTTPS connections to an IP address that cannot be identified due to a lack of reverse DNS entry. Jim asks if there is a timeframe for addressing these issues.</p>
