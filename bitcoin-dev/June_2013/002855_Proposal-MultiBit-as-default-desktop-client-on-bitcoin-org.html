    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has updated the supporting documentation for a Java application serving HTML in order to make it more accessible for developers who wish to contribute. The code can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit-website">https://github.com/jim618/multibit-website</a>. In addition, the author has created a dedicated support page on the website for users experiencing issues or needing guidance (<a href="https://multibit.org/support.html)">https://multibit.org/support.html)</a>. Furthermore, there is now a "Support" section with troubleshooting tips and common issues within the application's in-app help. If users cannot find the help they need from these resources, they are directed to bitcoin.stackchange.com or to Github issues to search existing or raise new issues. The email thread includes discussions on replacing Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app with MultiBit. Gavin Andresen voted in favor of this change, stating that he believed most users would be happier with MultiBit. It was also suggested that restrictions for newbie users should be relaxed in the alt client forums to make it easier for users to receive support.</p>
