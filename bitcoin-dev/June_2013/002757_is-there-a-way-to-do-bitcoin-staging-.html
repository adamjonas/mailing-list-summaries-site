    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message dated June 15, 2013, Dennison Bertram mentioned "proof of existence," which is a bitcoin notary service that proves a document existed before it gets inserted into the blockchain. However, he questioned whether this would be considered blockchain spam, particularly if used for high volumes in the future. Bertram suggested that these ideas might be better suited to a proto bitcoin without needing to create a brand new coin.Timestamping or "proof of existence" does not require a coin at all. To timestamp something, one has to collect all the hashes they need timestamped into a PoE merkle tree and add that to the merged mining MT. Therefore, it is simple and straightforward, but needs someone to implement it.</p>
