    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The main topic of the conversation is explaining and visualizing the status of transactions in Bitcoin. The challenge lies in conveying both whether the transaction has propagated the network and if it has been confirmed/buried in a block, to an audience that may not be familiar with the terminology. The solution proposed are transaction status icons that indicate the status of transactions as good, great or bad. In addition to this, the conversation also touches upon other topics related to Multibit, such as its default settings, its connections out to various nodes including bitcoind nodes and currency ticker providers like MtGox and CampBX. There is also discussion on the behavior of change addresses and the possibility of HD wallet support going into Multibit/Bitcoinj. There is mention of plans to put in intermediate "Exchange Data Provider" servers to patch servers when changes occur, which will not affect the multibits in the field. Additionally, there is a mention of users migrating to other wallets like blockchain.info or coinbase.com, but the focus is to keep Bitcoin as P2P as possible. Finally, there is discussion on the number of full nodes versus SPV nodes, and whether Multibit will ever participate in the Bitcoin network other than as an SPV client.</p>
