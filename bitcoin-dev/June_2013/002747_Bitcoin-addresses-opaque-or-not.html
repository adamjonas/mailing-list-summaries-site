    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Melvin Carvalho and Luke discuss the meaning of "opaque" in the context of Bitcoin addresses. While Melvin argues that opaque means that you cannot tell anything about the address by examining the characters, Luke says that transparency of addresses depends on their interpretation. He suggests that while transaction handling software needs to be able to translate addresses, URI handlers should not try to interpret them as anything other than arbitrary words.The duo also discusses the accuracy of certain wiki pages related to Bitcoin addresses. Luke says that the information on these pages is true at the moment but subject to revision by newer standards. Additionally, he indicates that there will likely be a change from the base58 encoding for Bitcoin addresses at some unspecified time in the future to address known limitations of base58. However, the exact changes and timeline are not established yet. The only currently planned change to addresses is the inclusion of Payment Protocol URIs. Luke recommends that software developers should not assume that addresses will remain base58 forever.</p>
