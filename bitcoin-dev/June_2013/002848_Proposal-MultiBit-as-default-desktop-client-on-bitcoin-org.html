    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, Gregory Maxwell responds to a question by Luke-Jr regarding the possibility of a reduction of full nodes on P2P network. He notes that without validation, listening isn't currently very useful and proposes some non-validation data that could be propagated, including block headers, confirmed transactions linked to a blockheader, proof-of-work/sacrifice limited P2P messages for micropayment channels, UTXO existence proof support for propagation of transactions, and UTXO fraud proofs. Maxwell explains that #2, which involves confirmed transactions, doesn't require changes to the protocol as it can be handled within the INV/getdata mechanism. He adds that someone could throw away a lot of hashing power and get an invalid block propagated, but SPV nodes should always take confirmations with a grain of salt anyway. The message is signed using GPG.</p>
