    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation in this context revolves around the issue of blockchain download and network effects for Bitcoin. While some users balk at the large blockchain download, others migrate to blockchain.info or coinbase.com. However, the focus is on providing a great client experience for low-tech users right from the start to win them over quickly, which would lead to more techie users using a full node. Alex Kravets suggests that regular people don't want to learn all the new terminology and should be directed to a decent client that just works and allows them to retain control of their private keys for mass adoption. He argues that the old tired argument about "Bitcoin needs your nodes" is manipulative and unnecessary since there are plenty of nodes that are mostly useless anyways. The conversation also touches upon the possibility of an overall net reduction of full nodes on the P2P network, and without validation listening, it isn't currently very useful.</p>
