    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, the writer proposes a voting system for Bitcoin clients that would be useful for straw polls such as bug fixes and protocol optimization. They suggest that contentious changes could be easily delivered to the general population and that trust should be distributed and diversified to the edges. However, the recipient of the message disagrees and argues that the current method of rough consensus and running code handles bug fixes and features just fine. The method is not effective for issues that are fundamentally political rather than technical in nature, like the block size debate. Ultimately, the issue at hand is what Bitcoin should be and who should be allowed to participate.</p>
