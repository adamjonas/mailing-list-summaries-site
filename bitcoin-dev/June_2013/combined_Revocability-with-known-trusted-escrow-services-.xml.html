        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context explores the idea of adding revocability to Bitcoin transactions without any protocol change. Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab, proposed a trusted escrow service that would issue time promises for signing and sign at the end of the time if it did not receive a cancel message. However, this system was vulnerable to griefing and relied on a trusted escrow service. Alan suggested two basic ways to create non-final states for transactions, including creating transactions with a locktime of X days and sequence numbers that allow them to be replaced exactly once within 30 days or sending money to either the recipient or the sender and requiring the recipient to sign for it by sending it to one of their own single-sig addresses.The conversation also touches upon the issue of tainted coins and how nothing can be done at the protocol level if the transaction needs to remain p2p. Leszek Rychlewski suggests collecting arguments against accusations from authorities who are exploiting differences between crypto currencies and the banking system to prosecute members of the new industry. Caleb believes that if there ever was a ban on Bitcoin, he would be more concerned for the future of the country imposing it than he would be for Bitcoin. The context further discusses an American Banker article that claimed FinCEN believes irrevocable payments are tools for money laundering. Vessenes disagreed with this assertion and argued that credit card transactions are not completely reversible either. He proposed the idea of layering on revocability without any protocol change as an opt-in using 2-of-3 dispute mediation, which is outlined in Satoshi's paper. However, he noted that such a solution would require deployment of the payment protocol first. Ultimately, Vessenes believed that having reversible payments where one party decides whether to reverse seems pointless. He expressed his desire for a one-day reversible system that would enable him to have warning if someone attempted to spend his coins. He also mentioned Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper that was not mentioned in the article, which stated that completely non-reversible transactions are not possible due to financial institutions' mediation of disputes. However, Vessenes believed that having reversible payments where one party decides whether to reverse seems pointless, as it is equivalent to post-pay for buyers and just a refund for sellers, which can already be supported by the payment protocol. The conversation ends with Jorge Timón's website link.</p>
