    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about Bitcoin privacy concerns. The use of Tor as a recommended best practice for privacy in Bitcoinj was discussed, but it was concluded that the primary privacy issue with bitcoinj is leaks via the block chain rather than the network layer. Sybil attacks are not interesting if you are the one sending funds, and false confirmations are expensive to generate. However, the NSA was suspected of recording all Bitcoin traffic for future analysis to find true transaction origins. The need for node-to-node connections to be encrypted to protect against network-wide passive sniffing was discussed. The conversation then shifted to the topic of replace-by-fee rules. A double-spend generator was run against the replace-by-fee node set up by Peter Todd, and it was found that a small percentage of hashing power was following replace-by-fee rules. It was suggested that miners should be encouraged to use replace-by-fee rules, and an experiment was proposed to give away money through a tx generator in the mining forum. Solid mempool support for the "scorched-earth" double-spend countermeasure was preferred before the experiment occurs.</p>
