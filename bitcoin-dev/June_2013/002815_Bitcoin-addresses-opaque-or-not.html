    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on June 11, 2013, regarding the nature of opaque addresses, Luke-Jr stated that whether an address is opaque or not depends on context. While transaction handling needs to be able to translate addresses, URI handlers should not try to interpret them beyond their arbitrary word representation. Melvin Carvalho replied that URIs are the global variable of the internet and need to be compatible with other URI schemes. He also expressed concern that bitcoin being treated as a relative URL could cause issues. Luke-Jr clarified that the wiki's explanations of how addresses work may not be relevant to most software in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but should be of interest to developers working on components that interact with addresses. The base58 encoding for addresses is likely to change at some point in the future to address known limitations, and inclusion of Payment Protocol URIs is the only currently planned change. However, Luke-Jr is opposed to address changes until their wider implications are fully understood.</p>
