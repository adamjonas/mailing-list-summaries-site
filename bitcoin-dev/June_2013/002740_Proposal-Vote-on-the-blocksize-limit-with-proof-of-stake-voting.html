    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner expressed concern that requiring users to sign votes would force them to reveal their public key and potentially expose large amounts of money intended for long-term storage. He suggested that some users with a lot of funds might see this as inconvenient and prefer to avoid any exposure at all. A possible solution presented in the conversation was to add a voting-only public key to outputs, using an opcode called "OP_VOTE" and a code-path that only executes for that specific key. This would work best if merklized abstract syntax trees were implemented to allow the revealing of only the part of a script that is executed rather than the whole script. The conversation also discussed how new opcodes could be implemented with a soft-fork by redefining one of the OP_NOP's to be an OP_VERSION opcode that returns false for a given version. Finally, the email includes a digital signature from 'peter' at petertodd.org.</p>
