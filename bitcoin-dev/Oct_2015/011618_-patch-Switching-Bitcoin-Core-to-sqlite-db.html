    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the bitcoin-dev forum in October 2015, Jeff Garzik noted that leveldb was unmaintained and that alternatives were being researched. Tom Zander asked for links to any problems with levelDB. One link provided was a Wikipedia page which outlined bugs and reliability issues with the database. Additionally, when Armory used LevelDB between versions 0.8-0.92, numerous users experienced DB corruption issues, particularly on Windows. Even after switching to LMDB in version 0.93, complaints would still come in from users whose Core DBs were based on LevelDB. Doug, who moved Armory over to LMDB, said he would love to have more time in the day to write a Core patch that does the same. He suggested that LMDB works quite nicely after patching up the source code and is compatible with Core's cross-compiling scheme.</p>
