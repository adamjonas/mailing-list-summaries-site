    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin developer meeting discussed several topics, including mempool limiting, sendheaders BIP, versionbits, dev/discuss list policy, and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. The mempool is a collection of transactions held in memory until they are added to a block. To prevent nodes from crashing, the devs are working on ways to limit the mempool without making it vulnerable to attack. The sendheaders BIP aims to make block relay more efficient by announcing block headers instead of block hashes. The versionbits topic focuses on using all bits of the version number for softforks, allowing them to be deployed simultaneously and independently of each other. The dev/discuss list policy was addressed due to inappropriate posts and an increasing volume of off-topic discussions. A new bitcoin-discuss list was created along with clear policies and moderation for both lists. Lastly, the meeting reviewed and discussed the progress of CLTV and CSV.</p>
