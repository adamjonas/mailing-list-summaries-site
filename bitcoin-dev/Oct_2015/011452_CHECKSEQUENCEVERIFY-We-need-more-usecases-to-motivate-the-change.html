    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Joseph Poon stated the need for a relative CLTV. He also added that it is imperative to implement this feature via nSequence and not just with CLTV/hard-nLocktime alone. There are some advantages to using a relative locktime field such as nSequence over purely a script opcode. The separation of the opcode and the actual validation of block height in the codebase as nLockTime could be helpful. The impact could be minimal, but there may be future interpretations of nSequence, and in particular, there may be some kind of need for some kind of "timestop" bit. To account for more than one upgrade, the next future upgrade after BIP 68 can be implemented by taking the unused most significant bit in nSequence as defined in BIP 68 in combination with using up a version field bit.</p>
