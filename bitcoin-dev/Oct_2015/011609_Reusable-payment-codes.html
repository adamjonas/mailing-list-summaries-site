    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 22, 2015, a discussion occurred on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding whether BIPs should be designed around current software. Luke Dashjr made the statement that they should not, to which Justus Ranvier strongly disagreed. Ranvier argued that there is a version byte in the payment code specification for a reason and that Version 1 payment codes were designed to be deployable without requiring users to wait on any network-level changes or yet-to-be-invented-and-deployed filtering schemes. He also noted that multi-push OP_RETURN outputs are not standard transactions and therefore cannot be relied upon for network relay, making any improvement to the protocol requiring this feature inappropriate for Version 1. It was later pointed out by 'peter' that multi-push OP_RETURN outputs would be standard in v0.12.0.</p>
