    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn has expressed his opinion on the deployment of BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. He stated that there is no consensus on using a soft fork to deploy this feature, as it will result in problems for SPV wallets. Hearn suggests making it a hard fork instead to avoid the issues. He also proposes doing nothing or dropping the "everyone must agree to make changes" idea. Another member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list agrees with Hearn and believes that consensus on consensus must be reached before any decisions are made. They suggest doing nothing as they did with the blocksize decision, using the same set of rules for all decisions. The discussion on the mailing list continues regarding potential risks and solutions for SPV clients during soft forks.</p>
