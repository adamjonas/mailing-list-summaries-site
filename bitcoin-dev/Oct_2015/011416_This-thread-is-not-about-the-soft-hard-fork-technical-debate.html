    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gregory Maxwell, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, questioned the necessity of listening only to "regular contributors" during a discussion about forking the protocol. In response to another user's comment, Maxwell stated that he did not believe there were any regulator contributors who disagreed with the proposed fork. The question was then raised about what qualifies someone as a "regular contributor." The idea of only listening to regular contributors sparked debate within the Bitcoin community. Some argued that it was important to consider the opinions of all users and developers, regardless of their level of involvement in the project. Others felt that those who had contributed more significantly should have greater weight in decision-making. Ultimately, the discussion highlighted the challenges of governance in decentralized systems like Bitcoin. Without a central authority or governing body, decisions about the protocol must be made through community consensus, which can be difficult to achieve when there are diverging viewpoints.</p>
