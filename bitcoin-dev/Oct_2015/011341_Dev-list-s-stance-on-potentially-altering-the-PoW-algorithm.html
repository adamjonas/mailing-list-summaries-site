    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 2, 2015, a discussion was held on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding algorithmic protection from ASIC/FPGA optimization. Jorge Tim√≥n argued that it would be impossible to guarantee such protection since anything that can be done with software can also be done with hardware, and specialized hardware is always more efficient energy-wise. However, BIP99 allows for "anti-miner hardforks" to restart the ASIC and mining market in case mining becomes too centralized. The term "ASIC-resistance" was criticized as an absurd term coined to promote some altcoins. A link to a research paper on asymmetric proof-of-work based on computational puzzles was also provided.</p>
