    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 13th, 2015, Jonathan Toomim noticed that many of his running bitcoind processes were using around 3GB of RAM, despite the mempool being under control. He restarted the process and after a few minutes, he observed that the memory usage was much more reasonable with a mempool size of 0.67MB and 317MB RAM usage. He also provided details about another node that had been online longer, where memory usage was around 3540MB with a mempool size of 39MB. After restarting bitcoind, the mempool size reduced to 39 and bytes to 47037. Jonathan asked for guesses on where they might be leaking memory or what is using the additional 2.4 GB. This issue appeared to happen with both Bitcoin Core 0.10.1 and Bitcoin XT 0.11B.</p>
