    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The importance of measuring miner adoption is highlighted in the context, as it is not a vote but an adoption metric for an uncontroversial upgrade. The imperfections of current mechanisms are discussed, and the fact that miners have disabled checks despite signaling adoption in their blocks in the past is noted. However, a hashpower supermajority would make such attacks hard to pull off in practice. A discussion on the vulnerability of a soft fork is also presented, where an attacker can create a transaction that would be valid if it were an OP_NOP, but not valid if it were any more restrictive transaction. This would exploit the difference in validation rules as long as miners are still on the old version to mine them. Transactions can be created that are guaranteed to be orphaned and trivially double-spendable.</p>
