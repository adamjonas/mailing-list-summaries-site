    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A message from Btc Drak was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on 10/5/2015 at 6:56 PM. In the message, he denies the existence of a development gridlock and suggests that people look at the IRC logs for core-dev. He also asks people to stop being intellectually dishonest and toxic. The block size debate is seen by most people outside of the development team as "gridlock." However, since everyone has their own definition of what constitutes "spam," "attack," and "decentralized," arguing over it is generally pointless. The system where anyone can veto a change promotes gridlock.</p>
