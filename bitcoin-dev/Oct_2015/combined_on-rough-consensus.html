        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The importance of "rough consensus" is highlighted in a post which suggests that participants of Bitcoin can improve their ability to stay on a valuable and censorship-resistant blockchain by absorbing cultural wisdom regarding rough consensus. The concept of rough consensus originated from one of the "founding beliefs" of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). To achieve rough consensus in the IETF, objections must be debated until most people are satisfied that these objections are wrong. Strong objections do not block rough consensus but are considered and addressed by the working group chair. Consensus within the IETF is achieved when everyone is sufficiently satisfied with the chosen solution, such that they no longer have specific objections to it. Even if no particular person is still standing up for an issue, substantive issues need to be addressed before the chair can claim that rough consensus exists. Rough consensus is a good defense against committing to decisions with subtle undesirable long-term effects. To learn more about forming useful rough consensus, one can refer to "The Tao of the IETF" and RFC 7282. While Bitcoin Core is not an IETF working group, its developers can still work on what they know and speak clearly enough to the economic majority to ensure that the system works. The post emphasizes that voting leads to worse technical outcomes and that consensus-building is used as a tool to get to the best technical outcome when decisions are made.</p>
