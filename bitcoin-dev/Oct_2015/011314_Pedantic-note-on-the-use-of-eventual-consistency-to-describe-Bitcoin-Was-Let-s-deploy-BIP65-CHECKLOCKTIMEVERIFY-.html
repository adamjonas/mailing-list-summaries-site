    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about guaranteed eventual consistency, Jorge Tim√≥n received a correction from someone stating that in Bitcoin, the probability of reorg to a particular point diminishes over time but never reaches zero. This is different from the usual definition of eventual consistency, and Bitcoin has stronger ordering properties than implied by eventual consistency. However, this correction is irrelevant to the original point being discussed, which is that soft forks follow the normal consistency process for Bitcoin while hard forks, especially mutual ones, do not. While the use of the term "eventual consistency" to describe Bitcoin may cause cringing among some academics, the correction offered is a minor one.</p>
