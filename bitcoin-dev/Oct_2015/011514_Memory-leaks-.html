    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message thread discusses the memory consumption in bitcoind on machines running Debian and p2pool. The original post reports that after running for a day, the size of the process was 1085 with 16151768 bytes on a Windows 8.1 box. There is a discussion about comparing this to having set up a node on a completely clean computer, which is not feasible for the poster as all servers are being used for something. Two machines run XT while one runs Core and all three machines experience excessive memory consumption. The discussion also touches upon RPC calls and blocksize and governance debates. Finally, the poster offers their services as a techie and lists their current projects.</p>
