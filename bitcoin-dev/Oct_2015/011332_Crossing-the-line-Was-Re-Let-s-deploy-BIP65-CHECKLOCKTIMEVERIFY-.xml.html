    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer expresses concern about the noise level and drama within a community list and suggests temporal bans based on circumstances. They suggest focusing on disruption of the list rather than specific personalities. The writer then addresses a post made by Mike Hearn regarding false and damaging statements about Bitcoin. The writer questions whether Hearn has crossed a line that would result in expulsion from the community and asks for thoughts from the community. The email includes links to evidence of Hearn's behavior and claims. The writer suggests taking a cooling off period before taking further action.</p>
