        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In October 2015, Boris Neklabaro inquired about the possibility of merging two Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) and spending from multiple Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) inputs. He also asked if it was feasible to combine inputs from P2SH and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) in a single transaction. The response to these queries affirmed that it is indeed possible.To understand this, one must delve into the technical aspects of Bitcoin transactions. A UTXO refers to an output from a previous transaction that has not been spent as input for another transaction. In order to merge two UTXOs, both outputs must be owned by the same address. On the other hand, spending from multiple P2SH inputs is feasible because P2SH allows for the use of more complex scripts as locking conditions for transactions. Consequently, it is possible to have multiple P2SH inputs controlled by the same address.Likewise, combining inputs from P2SH and P2PKH in a single transaction is also possible. P2PKH involves sending funds directly to a public key hash and is a simpler form of Bitcoin transaction. Although it may appear less secure than P2SH, it remains a valid transaction method.Therefore, while merging UTXOs necessitates ownership of both outputs by the same address, spending from multiple P2SH inputs and combining inputs from P2SH and P2PKH in a single transaction are both feasible within the technical framework of Bitcoin transactions.</p>
