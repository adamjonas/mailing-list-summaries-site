    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Tom Harding and Gregory Maxwell on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Tom raised an important point regarding the dynamics of centralizing pressure in regards to development. He questioned the use of "regular contributor" as a bar to an opinion being worthy and suggested that it could lead to ever-increasing centralized control of the code base. This, in turn, could potentially limit the evolution of Bitcoin. Peter Todd, another member of the mailing list, supported Tom's view and suggested that they work towards deprecating the idea that Core is the "core of Bitcoin". Instead, he proposed multiple competing implementations such as XT and btcd, which would make it easier for the community to determine the evolution of Bitcoin by expressing their vote based on the code they choose to run.</p>
