    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, it was noted that leveldb, a database library used by Bitcoin Core, is currently unmaintained. This has prompted researchers to look into alternative libraries that are both reliable and actively maintained. While no specific problems with leveldb were mentioned in the initial email, previous issues have been reported with the library's performance and memory usage. These concerns were highlighted in a 2018 GitHub issue where users reported experiencing "huge" memory requirements and slow write speeds when using leveldb.Despite these issues, leveldb has remained a popular choice for many Bitcoin developers due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, with the library now being unmaintained, it is important for developers to consider alternative options that offer both reliability and active maintenance.</p>
