    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has queried the Bitcoin mailing list as to why the network must reply every single transaction since its inception instead of starting from a closer state with only new transactions. The developer suggests that nodes could rely on a very small working "transaction log", which would allow companies to rely on some transactional information from little PDAs on warehouses, or simply relay a small amount of information to a satellite, without the need for storing every single historical transaction forever. Responders to the query have suggested that the invalidation of transactions in a trustless system means that the whole blockchain is required to confirm validity, and that downloading the whole blockchain does not mean it needs to be stored entirely. They also suggest that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) can be implemented to validate and download only the portions of the blockchain in which a user is interested.</p>
