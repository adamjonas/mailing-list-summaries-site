        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion about guaranteed eventual consistency, Jorge Tim√≥n was corrected by someone regarding Bitcoin's properties. They stated that the probability of reorganization to a specific point in Bitcoin decreases over time but never reaches zero. This is different from the definition of eventual consistency. Bitcoin has stronger ordering properties than what is implied by eventual consistency. However, this correction is not relevant to the original point being discussed.The original point was that soft forks follow the normal consistency process for Bitcoin while hard forks, especially mutual ones, do not. The use of the term "eventual consistency" to describe Bitcoin may cause cringing among some academics, but the correction offered is minor. It is important to note that the process of ensuring consistency in Bitcoin can differ based on the type of fork being used. Soft forks follow the standard process, while hard forks require a different approach.</p>
