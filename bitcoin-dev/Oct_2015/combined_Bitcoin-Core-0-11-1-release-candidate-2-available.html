        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core versions 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 have been released, with the aim of improving security and trust in the software. Gitian builds are being used to ensure that the binaries distributed are produced from verified source code. Version 0.11.1 includes bug fixes and improvements such as changes to transaction relaying, better handling of orphaned blocks, and an increase in the default number of outbound connections. Version 0.10.3 is a maintenance release with security fixes and backports from the 0.11.x branch.The release of these versions comes at a time when the Bitcoin community is still debating the block size issue. Some users advocate for a larger block size limit to allow for more transactions per block, while others argue that this would centralize the network. The Bitcoin Core development team has not taken a stance on the issue, but they prioritize security and stability. The release of Bitcoin Core versions 0.11.1 and 0.10.3 demonstrates the commitment to improving the protocol's security and reliability. By using gitian builds, users can be confident that the code they are running is exactly what the developers intended, with no unauthorized changes or additions.In addition, Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 release candidate 2 has been announced, providing a new minor version release with security fixes. Users are encouraged to upgrade or downgrade if necessary. This latest version addresses a buffer overflow issue in the XML parser during initial network discovery and disables upnp by default to prevent future libupnpc vulnerabilities. The minimum relay fee default has also increased from `0.00001` to `0.00005`.</p>
