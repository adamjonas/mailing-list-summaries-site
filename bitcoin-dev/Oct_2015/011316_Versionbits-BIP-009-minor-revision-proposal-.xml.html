    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around making a BIP deployment optional but recommended for the first time. The purpose of this would be to collect valuable data, which would help in identifying faulty implementations and bugs. The gravest danger comes from shortcuts taken in implementations and/or bugs. It is suggested that eventually, a more sophisticated signaling mechanism will be introduced where end-users can get informative messages regarding changes and direct them to resources where they can learn more about new features.The conversation also discusses the possibility of requiring setting the bit for a period of time after rule enforcing begins, but not enforcing the bit, just enforcing the validity of the block under new rules. This would allow thin clients to treat these blocks with increased skepticism. However, introducing this later would trigger warnings on older clients, who would consider the bit to represent a new soft fork. Therefore, it is suggested that the simplest solution would be to have miners keep setting the bit for another 2016 blocks, and if needed, this can be made a consensus rule.</p>
