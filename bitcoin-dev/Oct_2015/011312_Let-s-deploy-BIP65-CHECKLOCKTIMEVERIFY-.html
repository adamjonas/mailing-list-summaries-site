    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin workshop, Adam Back had a discussion with Gavin about the possibility of XT making things easy and adapting to what it is doing. Specifically, in relation to versionBits, Gavin expressed his willingness to update XT with an updated/improved versionBits. It was suggested that it would be more sensible to have both Core and XT follow a simple and clean approach, and only debate on technical topics if there is a particular philosophy involved. Rusty supported this proposal and added that it is important not to break existing software. Overall, the proposal seems quite constructive and trivial to implement.</p>
