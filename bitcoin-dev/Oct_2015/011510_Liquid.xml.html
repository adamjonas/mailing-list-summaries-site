    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Benjamin expresses surprise and confusion over an announcement that Blockstream will implement sidechains for exchanges. He questions the relevance of Bitcoin to existing financial institutions, rapid transfer, and settlement, stating that Bitcoin is anonymous digital cash and doesn't involve settlement in the traditional sense. He also questions Blockstream's commercial products and the launch partners mentioned in the announcement. Daniel clarifies that Benjamin's questions don't make sense because he's conflating Bitcoin with Blockstream/Liquid. He confirms that Blockstream does have commercial products and that implementing sidechains for exchanges was always part of their plan. Adam suggests that Benjamin read a Reddit thread on Liquid and post his questions there if they're not answered. He also notes that the email thread is off-topic for bitcoin-dev as it pertains to Bitcoin development.</p>
