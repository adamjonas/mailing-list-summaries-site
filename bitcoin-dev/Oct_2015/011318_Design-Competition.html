    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A person expressed their concern about the KYC policy of Lykke, a trading platform for foreign exchange. They stated that they won't be a part of it and advised others not to be either. On another note, Richard Olsen, CEO of Lykke, announced that the company is looking for participants in a Bitcoin-related competition. The aim of the competition is to build a trading platform, initially for foreign exchange but other assets will follow, which lets participants settle their trades through the blockchain via colored coins. A sidechain is suggested but not required. The requirements are posted on their website www.lykkex.com, and all contributions will be made available under an MIT license on Github. Olsen encourages questions to be asked during an online briefing event or over email. Lastly, the signature includes links to abis.io, which is a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and keybase.io/odinn.</p>
