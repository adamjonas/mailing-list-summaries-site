    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Byron Gibson via the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Nina K expressed her experience of using Shadow, a simulator used to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. While she believes simulators are important for testing, Nina pointed out that Shadow has limitations, especially when running with Tor. She explained that since many BCT transactions transpire over Tor, it is logical to test with the same setup. However, she found that running Shadow with Tor slows down her computer, making it impossible for the stats to be accurate. Nina wondered if this experience is common or if there is an adjustment that needs to be made. Byron Gibson had initially sent an email to the mailing list inquiring about the use of simulators like Shadow and BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. He posed some questions about their capabilities and limitations. In his email signature, Byron provided links to his website and Keybase profile. The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is maintained by the Linux Foundation and provides a platform for developers to discuss technical aspects related to Bitcoin development.</p>
