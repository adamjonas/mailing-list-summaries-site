    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on October 5th, 2015, a member named s7r expressed their opinion that they did not view the topic at hand as controversial or a violation of BIP requirements. However, despite explanations from members gmaxwell and Jorge, another member named Mike still had objections. S7r stated that they enjoyed reading the explanations but were not convinced and felt that the objections still stood. The topic under discussion was related to softforks, which s7r felt were unnecessarily dangerous and not worth the risk.</p>
