    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An investigation into the high memory usage of bitcoind has been carried out by Jonathan Toomim. Two bitcoind processes were compared on the same machine with the same settings running on different ports, one of which ran bitcoin-cli getblocktemplate every 6 seconds. Results highlighted that the getblocktemplate RPC is implicated in this issue. Valgrind was also run twice on bitcoind for 6 hours each time while hitting it with getblocktemplate every 6 hours. The results showed that there were no signs of a multi-GB leak. One user on the bitcointalk p2pool thread claimed that he had this memory usage issue on Linux but not on Mac OS X under a GBT workload in both situations. This suggests that it might be a fragmentation issue due to poor memory allocation or bloated caches.</p>
