    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context suggests that Mike has become a concern troll and bully, having lost his integrity and trust. He insults people, mischaracterizes others, and quibbles over words and definitions. The author suggests that the core developers ignore Mike's input on core unless some XT feature is deemed good enough to incorporate. The email thread discusses an argument on the behavior of stating an opinion no one has held as theirs and attacking it. The author believes this is not a productive way to hold a discussion. They also mention their willingness to talk through any misunderstandings off-list rather than waste hundreds or thousands of people's time.</p>
