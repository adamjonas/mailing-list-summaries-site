        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list serves as a platform for constructive discussions on the technical development of the bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core reference implementation. To maintain a welcoming environment for a diverse range of participants, the proposed policy outlines guidelines on being friendly and patient, civil and considerate, assuming good faith, respecting time and attention, and disclosing potential conflicts of interest.Moderators are selected from various projects and roles to avoid cases where the set of moderators equals the set of bitcoin core committers or similar. Jeff Garzik via Bitcoin-dev suggested that if someone asks for help, it should be given politely with specific documentation or more appropriate venues provided. Conversations should remain focused and on-topic, and if a topic needs to be changed, a new thread should be started by changing the topic line of emails. Off-topic threads will be directed to other venues.However, the author of the message is concerned that someone will always call "off topic" regardless of how on-topic something actually is since there is no objective measure of on-topicness here. Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev suggested that only development help is appropriate for the list since some conversations may not be suitable for the list, and off-topic threads will be directed to other venues. Moreover, entirely new threads should be new messages, not merely a reply with a changed topic.In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeff Garzik stated that participants in discussions should disclose any potential conflicts of interest regarding employment or other projects they may be involved in. He also suggested that over-disclosure is better than under-disclosure when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest. Garzik went on to discuss the term "Bitcoin maximalist," which has become popular as an insult and refers to those who believe Bitcoin should be the only cryptocurrency in existence. Garzik argues that anyone involved in Bitcoin development who is not a Bitcoin maximalist could have a potential conflict of interest if they work for a company that competes with Bitcoin. Garzik believes that user dissatisfaction with Bitcoin development may be due to a lack of trust in developers working towards the success of Bitcoin.The proposed list moderation policy and conduct document aims to facilitate constructive discussion of issues related to the technical development of the bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation, meaning on-topic conversations would necessarily be related to technical development. However, the author thinks that the current language in the proposed list moderation policy and conduct document needs much more discussion and refinement. The author argues that it would be a shame if every time someone brings up something innovative, new or wonderful, or explores something on the boundaries, they are shouted down with cries of "Off Topic! ".Other resources that provide guidance for good behavior include Chapter 6 of Producing OSS by Karl Fogel, RFC 1855, and the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. The policy was inspired by the GNOME Code of Conduct, Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines, Ubuntu Code of Conduct, and other codes listed at the OpenHatch list of project codes of conduct.</p>
