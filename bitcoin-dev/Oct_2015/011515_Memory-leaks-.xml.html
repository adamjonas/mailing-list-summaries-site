    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Jonathan Toomim reports excessive memory consumption on three machines running Debian, p2pool, and either Core or XT. He provides the resident set size of bitcoind but is not sure how other processes running on the machine are relevant to his issue unless RPC calls are involved. He also mentions that he cannot afford to set up a node on a completely clean computer as all of his servers are being used for something. Additionally, Toomim requests anyone who has seen something similar to report their mempool size and total bitcoind resident set size for their running full nodes.</p>
