    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer, odinn, has referenced an ABIS (a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy) post from 2013 that he made in relation to microdonations. The discussion moved onto incentives for running full nodes with the last post made on this topic over a year ago. Odinn has now pointed out new developments in Bytecoin, which presents a working implementation of microdonations. The concept implemented there is arguably viable in Bitcoin as well. There is then a discussion regarding secure ways to use Hearn-style SPV mode, with some arguing that it is not very secure and volunteers running full nodes do not help things due to Sybil attacking being easy. However, others argue that the failure model does not seem specific to spv and could happen to full nodes too.</p>
