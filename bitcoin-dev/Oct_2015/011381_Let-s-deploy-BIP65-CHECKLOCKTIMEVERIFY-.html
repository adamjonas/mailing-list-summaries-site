    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on October 2, 2015, a member of the bitcoin-dev group suggested that discussions should be held to determine the issues that SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients face during soft forks and if there is anything that can be done to minimize the risks. However, it was pointed out that this topic had already been discussed and the recommended mechanism for mitigating risks during soft forks is the same as that used during hard forks - unknown block version notifications.</p>
