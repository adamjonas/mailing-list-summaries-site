        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Venzen Khaosan, a Bitcoin Core developer, has challenged Mike Hearn to a public debate about Bitcoin with specific conditions. The debate will last 15 minutes, including breaks, and will consist of three sessions of five minutes each, with two-minute breaks in between. Each speaker is allowed to make one statement in each session that does not exceed two minutes. The event will take place in a public venue with an international audience and an arbiter will be agreed upon. To protect himself from Hearn's "official" friends, the event will be unannounced and commence when Khaosan appears on an event panel. Khaosan believes he has the debating resources to show Hearn as an intellectual lightweight if he participates.However, Peter Todd, another member of the Bitcoin development community, deemed Khaosan's email off-topic and inappropriate for the forum and told him to "go away." Todd proposed two options to resolve the issue, but no consensus was reached. NMH questioned Todd's motives and challenged him to a public debate on the topic of Bitcoin with certain conditions, but Todd dismissed them.It is important to maintain a positive environment in the Bitcoin development community. The behavior of disruptive individuals can negatively impact the experiences of many others, leading to a decline in overall satisfaction and well-being. It is crucial to take action to prevent such individuals from disturbing the peace and causing harm. By implementing regulations and standards that ensure the protection and well-being of all members, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.In conclusion, Venzen Khaosan has challenged Mike Hearn to a public debate on Bitcoin, but it was deemed inappropriate by Peter Todd. The importance of maintaining a positive environment in the Bitcoin development community and preventing disruptive behavior cannot be overstated.</p>
