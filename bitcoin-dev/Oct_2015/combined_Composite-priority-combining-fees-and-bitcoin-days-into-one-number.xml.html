        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The process of assigning block space based on bitcoin-days destroyed (BDD) and fees has been criticized due to the need for two code paths, making it harder to write and maintain. One alternative proposed is creating a conversion rate between BDD and fees to create a composite priority metric. To optimize the process, the sum of the mempool fees and BDD would be stored and updated as transactions enter or leave the mempool, with recalculations occurring when a new block is found to minimize drift.On October 28, 2015, Jonathan Toomim expressed his opinion on assigning block space based on BDD and fees, arguing that node policy must remain easy to modify/customize in a flexible manner. He emphasized the importance of easy modification and customization of node policy in a flexible manner. Simplifying other code at the expense of making policies harder to configure is not a welcome change. Therefore, it is better to leave the main code less simple if custom policies such as the current default become harder.Luke Dashjr disagreed with Toomim's suggestion for an API that is calibrated on the whole mempool for calculating priority scores for transactions, stating that trying to communicate policies as simple numbers is significantly more complicated for the policy-writer than what they have now.In an email exchange between Dashjr and Toomim, the topic of node policy in regards to modifying/customising it was discussed. Dashjr argued that simplifying code could make custom policies harder to implement, specifically the default policy of 5% reserved space. He suggested using an abstract API that is calibrated on the whole mempool and has a method for calculating priority scores for transactions. This would make it easier for someone to write a reserved-space algorithm within the priority API scheme.</p>
