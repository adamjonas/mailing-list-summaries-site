    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In October 2015, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list named Benjamin expressed surprise at Blockstream's announcement that they would implement sidechains for exchanges. Benjamin questioned what Bitcoin had to do with existing financial institutions and why terms like "settlement" and "capital requirements" were being thrown around in relation to Bitcoin. He also asked if Blockstream now had commercial products. The announcement stated that Blockstream's solutions would increase market liquidity and reduce capital requirements for on-blockchain business models. Initial launch partners included Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and Xapo, with discussions underway with another dozen major institutional traders and licensed exchanges. It was noted that Blockstream likely had commercial plans in order to remain viable.</p>
