    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed changing BIP 68 to use 16 bits for the sequence number in both the block and time versions. This would allow time-based sequence numbers to have a resolution of 512 seconds, leaving aside 14 bits for further soft forks within the semantics of BIP 68. Peter Todd asked if there were any other proposals for implementing this feature via nSequence, to which Gregory Maxwell suggested using it as a way of discouraging miners from reorging chains or implementing proof-of-stake blocksize voting with nSequence. Rusty Russell considered these ideas as a compass, but believed that PoS voting could be implemented with just 5 bits, while the "prevbits" idea would require more bits. He suggested splitting between nLocktime (if available) and multiple nSequence fields, but also proposed an easy solution of changing the BIP wording and deciding on whether to keep the scheme on every transaction bump.</p>
