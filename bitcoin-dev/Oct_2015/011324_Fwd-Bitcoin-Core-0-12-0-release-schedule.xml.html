    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin Core software, Wladimir J. van der Laan explains that the software versions are incrementally numbered every half year without using them as a signaling mechanism. If they were to start using versioning as a signaling mechanism, questions would arise regarding the maturity of the software, potentially leading to long arguments that would not serve any purpose other than increasing a number. Despite claims that Bitcoin is not following semantic versioning, companies building on top of it, investments being made and the $3.5 billion market cap suggest that the 1.0.0 tag is overdue. However, Wladimir notes that this is not an important topic at present as they are already "horribly stressed-out".</p>
