    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context consists of a PGP signed message discussing the use of extended public keys in multisig arrangements. The message suggests that Pedro may want to participate in a 2-of-2 cosigning arrangement with a merchant who will deliver a laptop to him. To do this, Pedro provides the merchant with the same extended public key derived from path m/45', and the merchant provides Pedro with his own. Someone responds to this suggestion by questioning why m/i'/45' is not being used instead, where i' is the multisig "account" number. It is explained that within a BIP45 wallet, such as Copay, the xpubkey at m/i'/45' would be provided instead of the xpubkey at m/45'. It is noted that this method may no longer be pure BIP45. The message concludes with a PGP signature.</p>
