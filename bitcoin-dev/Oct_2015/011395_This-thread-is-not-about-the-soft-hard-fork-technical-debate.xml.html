    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Tom Zander expressed his concern over the decision-making process of the Bitcoin Core team. He argued that this process had been flawed in the past, causing harm to some developers’ passions. In response, another member of the mailing list explained that rejections of Mike’s PRs were due to substantial technical objections, and not related to the issue at hand. The argument against soft forks was also questioned given their successful use in BIP34 and BIP66.</p>
