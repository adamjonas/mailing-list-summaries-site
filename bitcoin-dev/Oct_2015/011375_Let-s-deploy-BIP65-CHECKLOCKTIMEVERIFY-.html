    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, two individuals are discussing the concept of hard forks in the context of cryptocurrency. While they agree that hard forks can have advantages, they disagree on the specifics of a particular rollout. One individual argues that fully verifying nodes should not converge with the miner majority, as this can lead to miners awarding themselves infinite free money. The other individual asks if a bip65 hardfork alternative will be produced to convince people of its advantages over bip65. However, the first individual is currently focused on the block size issue and does not believe there is much point in improving the blockchain protocol if most users are unable to use it. They explain that the modification for the hardfork is simple and involves replacing an existing opcode with a new one. The upgrade and testing plan section is still TBD.</p>
