        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Byron Gibson, the CoS of MirrorX and a software developer, expressed his interest in collaborating with others using simulators like Shadow and BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. He mentioned his capability to run a simulator on multiple nodes on AWS/GCE but emphasized the need for experiments that benefit from a controlled environment. However, Nina K shared her experience with running Shadow and highlighted its limitations in collecting accurate statistics when used with Tor. Andrew Miller also acknowledged the importance of simulators but noted that Shadow has its own set of limitations.In the conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Byron Gibson asked if anyone is using simulators like Shadow or BTCSim to test proposed changes to Bitcoin. Nina K responded that she had been using Shadow but found that running it with Tor slowed down her machine, potentially affecting the accuracy of collected stats. She questioned if others faced the same issue or if there was an adjustment that could be made. It was noted that while running Shadow may slow down the machine, the virtual time it uses does not affect the collected statistics. However, compared to abstract simulators, running Shadow can be unpleasant unless one has a fast machine.Nina K's experience with Shadow was shared in an email response to Byron Gibson's inquiry about the use of simulators. She believes simulators are important for testing proposed changes but pointed out that Shadow has limitations, particularly when used with Tor. Running Shadow with Tor significantly slows down her computer, making it impossible for the collected stats to be accurate. She asked if this was a common experience and if any adjustments could be made.Byron Gibson's initial query about simulators like Shadow and BTCSim was posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. The two mentioned simulators are free and open-source software tools used to simulate and test blockchain protocols. Shadow simulates large-scale networks of nodes, making it suitable for testing scalability, while BTCSim tests Bitcoin node behavior in various scenarios. These simulators help identify vulnerabilities and bugs in proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol before implementation. Byron provided links to his personal website and Keybase profile, indicating his involvement in software development and potential work related to Bitcoin. Although the purpose of his inquiry was not explicitly stated, it is clear that he wants to use simulators to test proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol and learn more about their capabilities and limitations.</p>
