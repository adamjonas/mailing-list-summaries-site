    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the need to disclose potential conflicts of interest and the use of "maximalist" labels which limit the extent of discourse. Participants are expected to be aware of their conflicts of interest and disclose them to other project members. Even if everyone approaches the topic in good faith, it's not that simple as people engage in name-calling and labelling of critics as "Ford maximalists." The minority view is that anyone who is not a Bitcoin maximalist has a potential conflict of interest if they're also involved in Bitcoin development. This issue is a cause of much user dissatisfaction with Bitcoin development, and users and investors need to trust that developers are working towards the unlimited success case. Although the person(s) proposing the list moderation policy and conduct document will not want to hear it, the list might be better off without a policy document enforced by moderators. The idea of keeping a protocol free of financial censorship extends to language as well, so people should be able to be free in how they write and speak, even when their peers on the list don't like what they see in others' expressions. It's recommended to remove the enforcement and moderator sections and have an "about" section for what the list is about, its purpose, and how people are supposed to treat each other.</p>
