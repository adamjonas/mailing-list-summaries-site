    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Serica and DigitalTangible actively use unspent transaction chains to speed up the bitcoin user-experience without waiting for blockchain confirmations. They do not currently have a need to chain more than 5 unspents, but they agree with the proposed policy of limiting MAX_ANCESTORS = 25 and MAX_DESCENDANTS = 25 as it is reasonable. However, they wish to avoid slippery slope restrictions in unspents falling from 25 to 2 or even 0. The limits should not prevent at least 5 step chains of transactions that are needed to give a customer temporary control over funds that they would otherwise not have access to unless they waited for a confirmation before conducting another transaction. All of this must happen within 0 confs because their customers will not wait for a whole confirm. Zero confirmations are helpful in increasing the adoption of Bitcoin and making it more competitive against other forms of payment. However, it is good to prevent abuse of the system with reasonable constraints for the current ecosystem of applications and wallets.</p>
