    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on October 15, 2015, Jeff Garzik via Bitcoin-dev provided guidelines for etiquette on the forum. He suggested that if someone asks for help, it should be given politely with specific documentation or more appropriate venues provided. Conversations should remain focused and on-topic, and if a topic needs to be changed, a new thread should be started by changing the topic line of emails. Off-topic threads will be directed to other venues. However, there was no other venue provided at the time for off-topic threads. Disclosing potential conflicts seemed futile for anyone not exclusively associated with a single company/organization. Additionally, discussing conduct on-list, either as part of another message or as a standalone thread, was deemed off-topic noise.</p>
