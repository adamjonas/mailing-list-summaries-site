    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list on October 5, 2015, Sergio Demian Lerner wrote that some people were discussing technicalities of a soft/hard fork without realizing that it was not Mike's main intention. Lerner clarified that the discussion had nothing to do with technical arguments and that Mike's intention was to criticize the informal governance model of Bitcoin Core development. He had strategically pushed the discussion to a dead-end where the group either ignores him or responds to his technical objections one after the other, bringing the project to a standstill. Lerner believed that having a more formal decision making process may not be too bad for Bitcoin and that it could actually be good. Eric responded to Lerner, stating that there is a difference between sincere technical objections and someone just being a "dick," and in this case, he thought that line had been crossed.</p>
