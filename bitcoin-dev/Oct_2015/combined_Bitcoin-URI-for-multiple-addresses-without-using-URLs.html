        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent query posted on the bitcoin-dev community, a member named Will White was interested in creating a website that would allow his bitcoin wallet program to donate to multiple addresses simultaneously. Rather than including a URL and having the wallet locate the information, he wanted to send his wallet a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) containing all the necessary details. Seeking advice on the matter, Will White wondered if it was possible to simplify the process by using BIP70 payment requests.BIP70 payment requests provide a solution to Will White's query by allowing users to specify multiple scripts or addresses to pay along with their corresponding amounts. These payment requests can be transmitted through various methods such as NFC, Bluetooth, HTTP(S), and Mail. To gain a deeper understanding of payment requests, interested individuals can refer to the following link: <a href="https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/wiki/Payment-Requests.Will">https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/wiki/Payment-Requests.Will</a> White's query on the bitcoin-dev platform revolves around the feasibility of sending a URI with all the necessary information to make donations to multiple addresses at once. Instead of relying on BIP71, which requires including a URL for the wallet to access the information, Will White aims to streamline the process. Hence, he is seeking guidance from the bitcoin-dev community regarding the possibility of implementing this idea within the context of BIPs.</p>
