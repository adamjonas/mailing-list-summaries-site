    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context revolves around the legal notices placed on the software related to Bitcoin protocol and its implementation. A copyright notice is a legal notice and the courts care about how it is written. The purpose of such a notice is to notify people of potential litigation if they use the software in a certain way. However, some individuals may go around speaking with authority even when they have no idea what they are talking about. In response to one such comment, Luke Dashjr states that copyright notices are merely informative to humans reading them and not relevant to development discussions. He requests that further discussion on this topic be directed to him directly and not on the mailing list.</p>
