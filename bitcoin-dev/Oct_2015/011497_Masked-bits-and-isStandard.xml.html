    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list received a suggestion from Notplato regarding an improvement for isStandard. According to the description of bits 16..29, they can take any value without affecting the script. Therefore, if these bits are off, it will help the script to pass isStandard. The author believes that this requirement can serve as a backup in case future uses of those bits are deployed as soft forks. However, they also expressed uncertainty about their understanding of isStandard and asked for clarification if necessary. In addition to this suggestion, the author also offered their services as a techie and provided information about their current projects.</p>
