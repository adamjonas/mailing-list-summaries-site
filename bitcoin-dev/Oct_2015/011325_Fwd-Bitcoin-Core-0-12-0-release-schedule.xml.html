    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Marcel Jamin asked Wladimir J. van der Laan why Bitcoin Core software is still at version 0.11.1. Wladimir responded that most of the investment in the network is not in the Bitcoin Core software, but in things building on top of it. The assumption being made is that nothing really stupid will happen to the network/protocol and that it will not go down. This implies a level of trust in the node software to maintain consensus, but doesn't necessarily mean that all rough corners have been dealt with regarding implementation. Wladimir also stated that Bitcoin Core software does not use version numbers as a signaling mechanism. Instead, they simply count up every half year. If version numbers were to be used as a signaling mechanism, questions would arise regarding the maturity of the software. These questions could lead to long arguments that would not accomplish anything more than potentially increasing a number.</p>
