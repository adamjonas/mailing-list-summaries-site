        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Eric has proposed a way to define soft forks as standalone units that can be merged with Bitcoin Core. The proposal would require changes in certain areas of the consensus code, but it could cover a wide range of potential soft forks through a small number of hooks primarily in main.cpp, consensus/*, script/interpreter.cpp, and primitives/*. Additional hooks could also be added in non-consensus code such as rpcblockchain.cpp or the wallet.To ensure proper enforcement of different combinations, unit tests could be built for each independent soft fork and compared. Eric is concerned about objections to the idea, but he believes it can be done without moving large chunks of code around. However, he questions whether supporting this feature is a good idea in the first place, as it may make soft fork deployments too easy.Despite his concerns, Eric recognizes that VersionBits (BIP0009) aims to make deployments faster and wonders if this initiative could be taken even further. He notes that his proposal is not currently required by the current versionbits deployment plan, but he is open to sincere objections if he is wrong.</p>
