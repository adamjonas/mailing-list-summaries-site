    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ongoing battle between the Core and XT camps in the Bitcoin community has resulted in a controversial new governance model. The credibility of the Core camp is being called into question by some, while others believe that XT is a disruptive attack. This has led to a situation where bans of individuals are being justified in the name of restoring peace and order. Peter R was recently banned on /r/bitcoin, and Mike was banned on IRC, causing concerns about "consensus by exclusion" becoming the new norm. It appears that Mike Hearn has emerged victorious in this battle, but the future remains uncertain for the Bitcoin community as a whole.</p>
