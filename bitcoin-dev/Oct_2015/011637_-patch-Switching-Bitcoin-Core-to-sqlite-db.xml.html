    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation in this context is between Gregory Maxwell and Simon Liu regarding the criticality of UTXO storage in Bitcoin. Simon suggests that UTXO storage being critical means it must be right, but Gregory explains that it must be consistent between all nodes. To understand how different database technologies might determine different answers to whether a transaction is valid or invalid, Peter asks for a specific example. He uses an unspent pay-to-pubkey-hash output as an example and questions if nodes would disagree on whether the transaction is valid or not. He seeks clarification on whether a database bug would cause some nodes to think the output was already spent while others could see that it was unspent. Peter requests a concrete example to help him understand why more than one implementation of something like the UTXO database would be unreasonable.</p>
