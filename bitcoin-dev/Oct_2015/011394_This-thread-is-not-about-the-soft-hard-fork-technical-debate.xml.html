    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 5, 2015, there was a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding Contingent Linear Time Locks (CLTV) deployment. Mike Hearn, a developer, expressed his concern over the controversy surrounding CLTV deployment and the preference of many developers for hard forks due to their perceived cleanliness and desirable properties. However, another developer refuted this argument, stating that while there have been discussions about the tradeoffs between hard forks and soft forks, it does not make either method inherently controversial. There is technical consensus to roll out CLTV by ISM, and any issues will be addressed during deployment in a similar manner to a recent attempt at rolling out a controversial hard fork.</p>
