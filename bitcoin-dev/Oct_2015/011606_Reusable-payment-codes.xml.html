    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Luke Dashjr expressed his disagreement with the adoption of a BIP as it stands. He argued that the proposed changes were "mere software changes" and therefore indistinguishable from network-level changes which could affect users and wallet developers. Dashjr also commented on the term "standard," pointing out that there are no standard transactions using OP_RETURN period, but since Bitcoin Core 0.11, 80 byte OP_RETURN transactions are standard. He criticized the practice of designing standards without putting the needs of its intended users first, saying that it was a great way to see the standard fail. On the other hand, he acknowledged the concept of permissionless innovation in Bitcoin, stating that if someone does not like payment codes, they don't need to use them.</p>
