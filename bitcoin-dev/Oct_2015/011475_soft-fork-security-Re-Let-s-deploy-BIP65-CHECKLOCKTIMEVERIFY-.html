    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 7, 2015, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the possibility of an attack even with a 99% hashpower supermajority on the new version. Eric Lombrozo suggested that an attacker could still perform this attack once per day by waiting for a non-upgraded miner to win a block. However, Jonathan Toomim of Toomim Bros argued that this wasn't something new or strong to worry about. In Bitcoin's game theory, there are three types of miners: honest (following protocol), bolstered by financial incentive to remain honest of subsidy & fees; agnostic/lazy (just run software, upgrade when they lose money and/or get shouted at); and dishonest.Toomim stated that Bitcoin remains secure with various combinations of percentages of these types of miners. However, he warned that assuming anything can lead to trouble.</p>
