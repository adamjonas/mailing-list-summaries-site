    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2015, Lucas Betschart suggested using Facebook's LevelDB fork called RocksDB for the Bitcoin database. He mentioned that RocksDB had nearly the same API as LevelDB and could be easily replaced. However, he was unsure if it would have any negative effects on their use-case since RocksDB was optimized for big databases running on multiple cores. In response to this, Sean Lynch pointed out that RocksDB was optimized for flash and may not work as well on spinning disks. Despite this, the original poster stated that it was okay for their purposes as they already had a huge database that incentivized having zero seek time.</p>
