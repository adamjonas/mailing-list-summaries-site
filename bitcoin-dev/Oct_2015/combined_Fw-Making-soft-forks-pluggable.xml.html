        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core Developer, has proposed defining soft forks as standalone units that can be easily merged with Bitcoin Core. This would allow for unit testing of each soft fork independently and comparing them against different combinations of enforcement. The proposal would require some changes in the consensus code, but it could be done without disrupting large amounts of code and with hooks that are easily documented for simple backports.Lombrozo expressed concerns about needing to convince everyone that nothing will break, and whether supporting such a feature is a good idea at all. One motivation behind this initiative is the VersionBits BIP0009, which aims to make deployments faster. If others think this is a good idea, Lombrozo plans to write up a detailed plan.The proposal could potentially lead to faster deployment of soft forks, as each fork would be tested separately before being merged with Bitcoin Core. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks associated with this change and whether it is worth implementing. Overall, Eric Lombrozo's proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with soft fork deployments by making them more modular and easier to test. It remains to be seen whether this idea will gain traction within the Bitcoin community and if it will ultimately lead to improved soft fork deployment processes.</p>
