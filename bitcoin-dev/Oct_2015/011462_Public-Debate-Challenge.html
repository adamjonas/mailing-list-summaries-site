    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Venzen Khaosan has challenged Mike Hearn to a public debate on the topic of Bitcoin with specific conditions. The debate will last 15 minutes, including breaks, and will consist of three sessions of five minutes each. During each session, each speaker will make one statement not exceeding two minutes. There will be two-minute breaks between sessions, and an arbiter will be agreed upon. The debate will take place in a public venue with an international audience. Venzen Khaosan will make the first statement versus Hearn's already established position and widely publicized views. Both speakers will commit to making three statements and participating in the full duration of the event. The footage of the debate will be published as-is with no editing or right to forfeiture, showing both participants at all times. To protect himself from Hearn's "official" friends, the event will be unannounced and will start when Hearn sees Khaosan on an event panel.</p>
