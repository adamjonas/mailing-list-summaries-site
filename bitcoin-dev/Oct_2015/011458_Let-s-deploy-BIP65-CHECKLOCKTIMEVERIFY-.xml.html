    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 5, 2015, Mike Hearn wrote a message via bitcoin-dev in which he discusses the extension blocks proposal by Adam Back. He notes that a soft fork would not cause non-upgraded full nodes to accept blocks that create more subsidy than is valid. However, Hearn questions whether this proposal would actually result in a soft forking change, as it could potentially create more subsidy than is valid and hide one block inside another. He argues that attempting to spend an output created in one of these extension blocks would turn it into a hard fork, as unupgraded validators would not update the UTXO set accordingly, meaning that those new TXOs couldn't be spent because they don't exist according to their rules.</p>
