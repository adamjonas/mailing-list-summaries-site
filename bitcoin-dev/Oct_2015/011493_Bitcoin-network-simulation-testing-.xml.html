    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Byron Gibson, CoS of MirrorX, expressed his interest to collaborate with others who have been using simulators like Shadow and BTCSim to test proposed changes on Bitcoin. He mentioned that he may have the capability to run a simulator on many nodes on AWS/GCE but would prefer to select experiments that benefit from a more controlled environment. In response, Nina K shared her experience with running Shadow, stating its limitations in accurately collecting statistics when used with Tor. Andrew Miller also acknowledged the importance of simulators for testing but noted that Shadow has its own set of limitations. The conversation took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on October 10th, 2015.</p>
