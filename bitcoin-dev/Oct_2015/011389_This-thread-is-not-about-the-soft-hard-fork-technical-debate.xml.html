    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on October 5th, 2015 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn stated that controversial changes to the consensus rules must not happen, indicating that CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify) cannot happen in its current form. The email was sent during a time of great debate and discussion within the Bitcoin community regarding the implementation of CLTV, a proposed upgrade that would allow for more complex smart contract functionality. The controversy surrounding CLTV was centered around concerns that it could potentially lead to a hard fork in the Bitcoin blockchain, which could have major implications for the network's security and stability. Hearn's email added fuel to the fire, with some interpreting it as a sign that the Bitcoin Core developers were unwilling to compromise on the issue.Despite the concerns raised by Hearn and others, the Bitcoin community ultimately decided to move forward with the CLTV upgrade. In July of 2016, the upgrade was officially activated through a soft fork, allowing users to take advantage of new smart contract capabilities while avoiding the risks associated with a hard fork.The debate over CLTV is just one example of the ongoing challenges faced by the Bitcoin community as it seeks to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency development. As the technology continues to evolve and mature, it is likely that we will see many more such debates in the years to come.</p>
