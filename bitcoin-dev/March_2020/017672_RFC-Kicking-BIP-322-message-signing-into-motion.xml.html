    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, several proposals for improving the BIP-322 pull request are discussed. The first proposal involves replacing the signmessage system with a prove funds system to discourage the misleading use of signmessage as a way to prove funds. The second proposal suggests using a transaction instead of a new format and making the first input's txid the message hash to ensure that the transaction cannot be broadcasted. The third proposal involves using Trezor style, which has already been adopted but limits generic signing. The fourth proposal is to introduce OP_MESSAGEONLY, which would make "dumb" signers more difficult to support as they would have to do script interpretation to make sure they're not signing something real with funds. Finally, the email asks if anyone has any other suggestions for improving BIP-322.</p>
