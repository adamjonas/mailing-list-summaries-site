    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Karl-Johan Alm noticed a Bitcoin Core pull request that touched everything his BIP-322 pull request touches, which was merged without any thought given to BIP-322 compatibility, despite the fact that the BIP-322 PR being open for twice the time. According to him, people dislike BIP-322 in its current form, which is why the 9-month-old pull request stagnated. Karl-Johan Alm lists several things he can do to make BIP-322 more appealing to people. First, he suggests throwing out the sign message stuff and replacing it entirely with a prove funds system. Second, he suggests using a transaction rather than a new format, making the first input's txid the message hash to ensure the tx cannot be broadcasted. Third, he suggests using Trezor-style. Fourth, he suggests introducing OP_MESSAGEONLY. Finally, he mentions some other solution.</p>
