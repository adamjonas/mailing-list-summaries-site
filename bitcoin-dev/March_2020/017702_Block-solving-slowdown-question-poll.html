    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of a difficulty adjustment trigger to be built into Bitcoin software for when the expected block production rate is far behind its expected value. The current software allows up to a two-hour difference between the system clock and the time implied by a fresh block's timestamp. The proposal is that miners detecting that the expected 2016 blocks have not been mined after twice the expected wait time (4032 * 10 minutes = 28 days) ought to signal their recognition in any block they produce. Any block produced on top of one with such a signal should reflect an expedited difficulty adjustment, which is then in effect for the rest of the 2016 blocks and the entire following difficulty period. If anyone thinks it is a good enough idea for a BIP, David A. Harding will consider writing one unless someone else wants to. In addition, other emails in the thread discuss mining as a lottery and possible solutions to handle a drop in mining power.</p>
