    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developers of bitcoin-s have announced the release of v0.3.0, which is a loosely coupled set of cryptocurrency libraries for the JVM. The goal of this project is to provide scalable cryptocurrency libraries that use industry standard tools wherever possible to make life easier for professional software engineers, security engineers, devops engineers and accountants. Although these libraries work well together, they can also be used independently. Bitcoin-s is not intended to be a full node implementation. The developers are focused on iterating development to reach a set of stable APIs that only change when the underlying bitcoin protocol changes.An interactive code editor has been made available to test basic data structures in bitcoin-s like private keys, psbts, and block filters. To learn more about how the neutrino node, wallet, bitcoind rpc client and secp256k1jni (bindings for libsecp256k1) work, the website provides examples. For those interested, the release notes for v0.3.0 can be found on the project's GitHub page.</p>
