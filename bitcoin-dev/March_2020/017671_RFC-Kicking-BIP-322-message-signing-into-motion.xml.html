    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Karl-Johan Alm has reached out to the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding his BIP-322 pull request, which aims to improve Bitcoin's signing message functionality. He notes that a similar pull request was merged into Bitcoin Core without considering BIP-322 compatibility, leading Karl-Johan to believe that people dislike BIP-322 in its current form. To make the pull request more appealing, Karl-Johan suggests several potential changes. Firstly, he recommends throwing out the sign message system entirely and replacing it with a proof-of-funds system. Secondly, he suggests using a transaction rather than a new format, with the first input's txid serving as the message hash to ensure the transaction cannot be broadcasted. Thirdly, Karl-Johan proposes adopting the Trezor style, which is already in use but limits generic signing. Fourthly, he recommends introducing OP_MESSAGEONLY to enable messaging purposes without consuming an op_code. Lastly, he invites suggestions for any other solutions. Karl-Johan encourages harsh criticism of these proposals if necessary, so that he can improve or abandon the BIP-322 pull request accordingly.</p>
