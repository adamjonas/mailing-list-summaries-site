    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Ruben and ZmnSCPxj discuss the use of a secondary output that can be spent by anyone to fee bump the kickoff transaction with CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). ZmnSCPxj suggests embedding it in a P2WSH/P2SH using an `OP_TRUE` `redeemScript`, but warns that any third party could spend such an output and prevent the parent from being confirmed. They also discuss the proposed solution for Lightning, which is giving each participant their own attach-your-fees output that only they can spend. Ruben responds by suggesting that as long as the kickoff tx is RBF enabled and unconfirmed, any transaction spending it automatically inherits its RBF status through inherited signalling. If the kickoff tx hits the chain, Ruben proposes "refreshing" the UTXO by agreeing with the statechain entity to spend it to a new statechain 2-of-2 UTXO on-chain, thus removing all prior owners. Ideally, it should be more costly to CPFP the kickoff tx than it is to refresh the UTXO, so the defender is at an advantage.</p>
