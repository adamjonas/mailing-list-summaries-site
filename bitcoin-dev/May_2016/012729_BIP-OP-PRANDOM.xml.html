    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When it comes to security in blockchain technology, using the hash of multiple blocks does not necessarily make it safer. This is because the miner responsible for the last block ultimately determines the results, even if the hashes of all previous blocks are known. To enhance security, Pay-to-script-hash can be used to safeguard contract details that use OP_PRANDOM from miners' prying eyes. However, there is still a non-zero risk that a participant in a contract may attempt to bribe a miner, making the inclusion of multiple block hashes as a source of randomness necessary. In order to control the results of random numbers, every miner would have to be bribed, which is highly unlikely. As N, or the number of blocks used in the hash, increases, the risk approaches zero.</p>
