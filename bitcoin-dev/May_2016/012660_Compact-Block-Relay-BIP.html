    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation on the Bitcoin developers mailing list, Rusty Russell suggested using variable-length bit encodings to reduce the size of transmitted data. Gregory Maxwell questioned this approach, asking what failure rate was being targeted. Russell explained that he was assuming best-case mempool set reconciliation and hoping for a more sophisticated approach with variable-length IDs in the future. Russell suggested avoiding the use of nonces to save on recalculation for each node, but Maxwell disagreed, stating that this would increase the cost of a collision if one were to occur. The conversation also touched on the idea of using UDP instead of TCP, but Russell was not convinced that this would be beneficial. Finally, Russell mentioned that adding extra bits in the sender's coding could prevent collisions without resorting to brute force decoding in the receiver.</p>
