        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A study on block propagation using Xthin over the normal P2P network and across the Great Firewall of China was conducted by a group consisting of Andrew Clifford, Andrew Stone, @sickpig, Peter Tschipper, and an unnamed author. The group used six Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) nodes to collect data on transmission and reception for more than 9,000 blocks. The methodology of their testing has been released in Part 1 of a five-part article series which can be found at the provided link. The group thanked Jihan Wu from AntPool for the block source within Mainland China and @cypherdoc for funding. The study aims to provide insights into how block propagation can be improved, particularly in countries with internet restrictions such as China. The use of Xthin could potentially reduce the time required for block propagation and help increase the efficiency of the network. Further details about the results of the study are yet to be released in the upcoming parts of the article series.</p>
