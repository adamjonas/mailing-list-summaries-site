    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A collision attack was discussed by Greg Maxwell to Tom Zander, where he explained that after grinding the extra output of a transaction 2^32 times, it's likely to find two which share the same initial 8 bytes of txid. Peter was trying to understand this collision attack and asked how one can actually find the pair from within a large set. He calculated that there are approximately 2^63 possible pairs in a set of 2^32 transactions, and hence, around 2^63 comparisons would be required to identify which pair of transactions are the two that collide. Peter was open to being corrected if he had made an error or if there was a faster way to scan the set to find the collision.</p>
