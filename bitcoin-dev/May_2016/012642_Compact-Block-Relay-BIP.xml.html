    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion between Tom and Gregory Maxwell on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding service bits and their use for indicating additional peer-to-peer feature support. Gregory argues that service bits are not a good mechanism for negating optional peer-local parameters. However, Tom believes that they are the right solution for indicating additional p2p feature-support. Gregory also expresses his concern about Tom maintaining a fork and being unaware of this issue. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about variable length encoding in Bitcoin Core and a BIP proposal related to it. A user questions why Gregory's reply was edited to change the tone of the message, to which there is no clear answer provided. The context ends with a PGP signature.</p>
