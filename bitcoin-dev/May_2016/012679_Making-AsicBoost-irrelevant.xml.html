    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development discussion in 2016, Matt Corallo expressed that the argument against ASICs being bad because it goes against 1-CPU-1-vote mostly died out long ago. However, as mining centralization in China became more prevalent, the topic of ASICs resurfaced. For instance, Z.Cash will use Equihash as their proof-of-work scheme. The concern is giving one manufacturer/licenser an enormous influence in determining who will be successful in a market that everyone relies on remaining flat. Central planning can be dangerous, so allowing the market to decide winners and losers is preferred. Hard forking every time an innovation or perceived unfair advantage appears in the space is not feasible.</p>
