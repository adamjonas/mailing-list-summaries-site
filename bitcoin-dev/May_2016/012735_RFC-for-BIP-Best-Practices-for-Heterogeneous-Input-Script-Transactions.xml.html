    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Best Practices for Heterogeneous Input Script Transactions (HIT) is a draft proposal that aims to minimize the negative impact on privacy and user protection protocols when transactions have inputs composed of different scripts. The document proposes a set of guidelines to address the adverse privacy consequences of HITs, while maximizing the effectiveness of user protection protocols. To accomplish this, the specification suggests two forms of HITs: Standard form and alternate form. Standard form HIT transactions must adhere to specific rules, including an equal number of unique input/output scripts, unique output scripts, at least one pair of outputs of equal value, and the largest output in the transaction being a member of a set containing at least two identically-sized outputs. These requirements prevent address reuse, limit UTXO set growth, and optimize behavior, causing intentional HITs to resemble unavoidable HITs.Alternate form HITs are used in cases where standard form HITs are not possible, such as when the HIT is unavoidable, or the user does not have sets of UTXOs with identical scripts. In this case, a compliant implementation may construct a transaction by finding the smallest combination of inputs whose value is at least the desired spend, adding these inputs to the transaction, creating a spend output and change output, and repeating the process to create a second spend output and change output. The change outputs are then adjusted as necessary to pay the desired transaction fee. The proposal aims to maximize the effectiveness of user-protecting protocols, minimize the adverse consequences of unavoidable HITs, and limit the effect on UTXO set growth. Non-compliant heterogenous input script transactions may be created if a user wishes to create an output larger than half the total size of their spendable outputs or if their inputs are not distributed in a manner that allows the alternate form procedure to be completed.</p>
