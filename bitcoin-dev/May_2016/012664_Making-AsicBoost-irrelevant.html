    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The argument regarding the use of AsicBoost in Bitcoin mining has been ongoing in the community. A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Timo Hanke, pointed out that there is no way to tell if a block was mined with AsicBoost or not. Thus it is impossible to determine what percentage of the hashrate uses AsicBoost at any given time and how to risk forking that percentage out. Hanke explained that a hardfork would guarantee the persistence of two chains instead of just one. However, Jannes Faber, another member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, argued that assuming AsicBoost miners are in the minority, their chain will constantly get overtaken. So it will not be one endless hard fork as Hanke claimed, but rather AsicBoost blocks will continue to be ignored until they stop making them. Nonetheless, a difficulty adjustment on the AsicBoost chain could change this situation. In such a case, both chains, the AsicBoost one and the forked one, would grow approximately at the same speed.</p>
