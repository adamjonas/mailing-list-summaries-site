    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 11, 2016, Timo Hanke raised concerns about a proposed hardfork that could lead to the persistence of two chains. Specifically, he questioned why asicboost miners would continue to use energy on a chain that everyone else has abandoned. Additionally, he argued that changing block validation ruleset R to S requires ensuring that any hardware capable of mining R-valid blocks can also mine S-valid blocks. Hanke disagreed with the proposal's claim that it would make patented asicboost hardware obsolete, calling it an opinion. He suggested embracing as many optimizations as possible to avoid such issues. Finally, Hanke asked for clarification on what the proposer meant by "embracing" a patented optimization that only one miner could use.</p>
