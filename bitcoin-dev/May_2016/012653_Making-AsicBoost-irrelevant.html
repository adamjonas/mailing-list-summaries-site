    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email dated May 10, 2016, discusses the proposed hard fork in the HK agreement and how to make patented AsicBoost optimization useless while making further similar optimizations useless as well. The email proposes changes to the Chunk 2 of double SHA256 where all data in Chunk 2 would be identical except for the nonce which would make finding collisions much more difficult. If hard forks are allowed, moving more of the merkle root into the second chunk would also make things harder. Additionally, timestamp and target could be moved into Chunk 1, increasing the merkle root to 12 bytes in the second chunk. However, if ASIC limitations mean that the nonce must stay where it is, the merkle root would be split into two pieces. The proposed fix should be compatible with existing mining hardware and ideally SPV compatible. The email contains links to the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus and a previous bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion.</p>
