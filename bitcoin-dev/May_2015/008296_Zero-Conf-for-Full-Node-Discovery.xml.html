    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the technique of seeding address databases via DNS which can be easily poisoned by controlling the LAN's DNS resolver creating a problematic security issue. Therefore, it was suggested to use a ZeroConf/Rendezvous solution in place so that local LANs can capture Bitcoin traffic away from Tor (with some notification to the user, presumably). This will help people having multiple nodes at home reduce bandwidth and improve sync without difficult setup. In response to this, Mike Hearn shared that bitcoinj is likely to bootstrap from Cartographer nodes (signed HTTP) rather than DNS, and they are steadily working towards Tor by default. The context also shares an interesting case of poisoning DNS by Matt Whitlock for a Bitcoin-only Wi-Fi network he operated at a remote festival. He forced all wallets to connect to a single local full node, which had connectivity to a single remote node over the Internet, to backhaul the Bitcoin network's transaction traffic once. The graphic for the banner that was made to advertise the network at the festival can be viewed through the link provided.</p>
