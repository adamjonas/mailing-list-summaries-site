        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Kalle Rosenbaum has proposed two Proof of Payment (PoP) proposals to the Bitcoin community. The first proposal is related to PoP data structure and process, while the second proposal focuses on the btcpop URI scheme. Rosenbaum is seeking community agreement to standardize these proposals. In a previous thread, no major objections against the idea were raised.The implementation of the proposals is available on GitHub, and Rosenbaum plans to extend BIP70 to support PoP after achieving consensus on the proposals. Feedback from the community was received and included in the updated version of the specification. The changes made include ensuring minimal impact if a PoP appears in the Bitcoin p2p network, checking if the transaction is actually a tx that you want proof for later in the validation process, including a version field of 2 bytes, and removing the "PoP" literal.The purpose of PoP is to provide proof of payment for various applications such as paysite login, concert tickets, left-luggage lockers, lotteries, video rental, etc.</p>
