    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation thread, the participants are discussing the possibility of changing the semantics of a field in the Bitcoin transaction. They discuss the potential benefits of saving more bits, but conclude that there is not much room for this due to time-based relative locktimes and long-lived channels. The discussion also touches on the idea of altering the transaction ID through serialization, which would cause a hard fork change. However, the proposed change is deemed backwards compatible and therefore a soft fork. The participants consider different ways of using the bytes for other purposes, such as setting the top 2 bytes to anything or activating a rule if the MSB of the bottom 2 bytes is set. Finally, they question whether there are any use-cases that require a relative locktime verify of more than 8191 blocks delay that cannot be covered by the absolute version.</p>
