    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Matt Whitlock and Mike Hearn, the issue of having to wait for confirmations before making a second payment is discussed. Mike Hearn refutes the claim that wallets such as Andreas Schildbach's wallet still have this limitation. However, Matt insists that he sees this behavior all the time in the latest release (version 4.30) and Testnet3 variant of the app. He provides an example where upon receiving one payment, attempting to send another payment without waiting for confirmation results in the wallet not allowing the transaction. Instead, it prompts the user to wait for the first payment to confirm. Matt mentions that he configures the app to connect only to his own trusted Bitcoin node, which means he doesn't receive instant confirmations. Mike confirms that this is indeed the cause of the issue. Due to a Bitcoin protocol limitation, instant confirmations can only be obtained from nodes that haven't received the transaction.</p>
