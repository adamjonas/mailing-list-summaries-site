    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Chris expressed his dislike of retroactively changing semantics and proposed that the version field should only be used for its intended purpose. He also voiced support for Sipa's proposal to flag support for a fork in the version field, although he did not particularly like this solution. The discussion also included Patrick Strateman's argument that there is no need to misuse the version field, as micro-controllers can build merkle tree roots faster than necessary. Sergio Lerner suggested leaving at least 16 bits of the version fixed as an extra-nonce to prevent miners from using them as a nonce and disrupting the soft-fork voting system. Lerner's original proposal can be found on GitHub.</p>
