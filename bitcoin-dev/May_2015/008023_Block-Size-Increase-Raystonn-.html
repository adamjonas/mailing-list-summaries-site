    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer suggests a realistic block size of 20MB for any transaction to occur. They argue that this amount of data is relatively enormous for a network, and a rate of 10 transactions per second over 10 minutes would be feasible at the current point in time. The writer also discusses the possibility of attaching nuanced data to the blockchain while keeping the identifiers integral OPSIg of the entire block. They suggest a block chain within 200-300 bytes that can allow for encryption standards such as DH algorithm keys to be added to the chain, enabling a higher integrity level within the system. The writer believes that a rate higher than the current standard of 92 bytes allows for GPUS ie CUDA to perform its standard operations of 1216 flops to mechanize a new personal identity within the chain that also attaches an encrypted instance of a further categorical variable that we can prescribe to it. They also point out an area of vulnerability for man-in-the-middle attacks upon request of Bitcoin to any merchant as is. The current best fit block size today is between 200 - 300 bytes, depending on how excited we get.Finally, the writer concludes by expressing their willingness to engage in further discussions and research to solve any problems revealed in their current formation of thoughts.</p>
