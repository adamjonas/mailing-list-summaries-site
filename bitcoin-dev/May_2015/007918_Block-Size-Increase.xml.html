    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was held among Jeff Garzik, Justus Ranvier and Peter Todd about the development of Bitcoin and its limitations. Justus asked whether Bitcoin's development should be limited in order to give room for other projects or if it should aim to be the best system possible and let other projects try to keep up. Jeff discouraged such narrow, binary thinking. Peter assumed that any other systems are honest and non-malicious. Justus felt that his question was being actively discouraged from being asked. The discussion was signed off with a PGP signature.</p>
