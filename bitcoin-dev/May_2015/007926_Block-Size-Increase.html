    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It seems that the sender's emails are being marked as spam, despite being sent from GMail's web interface. The issue has been identified to be with the mailing list software and not their setup. However, BitPay could disable phishing protections but it is considered a poor solution. To fix the problem, the sender could try sending emails from a non @bitpay.com email address such as Gmail or Hotmail, but Yahoo wouldn't work due to its enforcement of strict policies similar to BitPay's.</p>
