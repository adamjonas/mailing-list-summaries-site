    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the issue of block size in Bitcoin and the need for a plan to address it. The author notes that there has been no recent discussion on the mailing list and suggests that pull requests are a more effective means of making progress. They express concern about the timeline for a change to the block size and the need for leadership and a feasible plan within the available time frame to prevent Bitcoin from running out of capacity. The author disagrees with the idea that consensus is necessary for a block size increase and argues that the community cannot reach consensus on protocol-related matters. They also disagree with the notion that fee pressure is necessary, stating that it is difficult to predict what will happen when the money supply dwindles. The author points out issues with free transactions and the problems with arm-twisting the Bitcoin ecosystem into developing complicated systems to keep the show on the road. They argue that bigger blocks are the simplest thing that will work and call for a specific and credible plan from Blockstream that fits within the next 12 months and allows Bitcoin to keep growing, rather than vague comments about decentralization and research.</p>
