    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Tom Harding expresses confusion about the bitcoin transaction's relationship with a real-world "deal" and suggests that more specific definitions are needed. Additionally, he discusses the changing of signatures in transactions and how it affects the parties involved. He also mentions Armory simulfunding transactions and how one signer's input can be replaced after broadcasting. Furthermore, there is discussion on the potential consequences of changing inputs in transactions and the importance of warning signers of multi-input transactions. The conversation also addresses Kalle's Proof of Payment proposed standard and the possibility of one payer booting another to claim concert tickets all for themselves. Overall, the conversation delves into the complexities of bitcoin transactions and the various factors that can influence them.</p>
