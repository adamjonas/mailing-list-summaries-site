    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The capacity growth would not affect the ability of individuals to run full nodes, as current CPUs are not being fully utilized. The unpopularity of full nodes is due to uncontrollable bandwidth usage and the need for people to wait for them to catch up. However, these issues can be fixed with better code and merchants who are important users can keep their full nodes running all the time. The idea that Bitcoin might have to match VISA's transaction demand with today's hardware is unrealistic, as a single well-specced server can keep up with VISA. The problem of "too many users" is not a concern for Bitcoin currently or potentially in the future.</p>
