        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses various issues related to Bitcoin, including reducing block propagation time, blacklisting on the network, and the tradeoff between propagation speed gain and blockchain fork rate in smaller blocks. Sergio Lerner outlines the arguments against reducing the block interval, citing concerns about centralization, blockchain splits, decreased security, and insufficient testing.However, an email suggests that lowering the block rate can be a better way to increase transactions per second than increasing the maximum block size. The author argues against several arguments for not reducing the block interval, including concerns about centralization, blockchain splits, security, and technical/economic implications. Additionally, a discussion about blacklisting on the Bitcoin network concludes that it is flawed due to anonymity for validators and block makers.The article discusses the potential tradeoff between propagation speed gain and blockchain fork rate in smaller blocks in Bitcoin. The author suggests that although the propagation speed gain is linear in size reduction, after a certain point, the delay of the first byte takes over. Additionally, the blockchain fork rate increases superlinearly with smaller blocks, which can lead to inefficient use of mining resources and give an advantage to attackers who are more efficient in communication. The author advises against increasing the block generation rate in Bitcoin as it would be a controversial proposal and would not solve anything.In an email exchange, Leo Wandersleb expressed his belief that a one-minute block target would reduce payout variance tenfold and could make bitcoin more accessible as a payment method. In response, Sergio pushed for near-instant payments and opposed any changes that move the balance towards the economically upper billion. The email proposes that reducing the block rate to 1 minute can be a better way to increase transactions/second than increasing the maximum block size.The author argues against several arguments for not reducing the block interval, including concerns about centralization, blockchain splits, security, and technical/economic implications. The author suggests that lowering the block rate can decrease the probability of block competition, and the decrease in security is only if participants wish to decrease it. The email provides evidence and research to back up these claims. The author also suggests that upgrades to SPV wallets and optimizations to the protocol can help reduce the impact on mobile devices and bandwidth.The issue of increasing server bandwidth to achieve a tenfold increase in work distribution has been discussed. In addition, some pools do not validate blocks but mirror other pools, making this an epidemic of invalidity rather than a solution. The article also discusses potential attacks on the Bitcoin network and how blacklisting miners who engage in bad behavior is not effective due to various factors including anonymity and ease of relaying blocks via different addresses. Andreas Antonopoulos has stated that any attack by miners only lasts for 10 minutes before being stopped.Overall, the article and email exchange suggest that reducing the block rate to 1 minute can be a better way to increase transactions/second than increasing the maximum block size. However, there are concerns and arguments against this proposal, including the potential for centralization, blockchain splits, security, and technical/economic implications. Further testing and research are needed to fully understand the impact of reducing the block rate.</p>
