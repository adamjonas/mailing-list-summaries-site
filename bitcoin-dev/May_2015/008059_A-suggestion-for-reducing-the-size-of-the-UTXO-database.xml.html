    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Raystonn suggested selecting as many UTXOs as possible from as few addresses as possible and prioritizing which addresses to use based on the number of UTXOs it contains and how old those UTXOs are. However, a user pointed out that selecting older UTXOs gives higher priority for a lesser fee, which doesn't support privacy or a reduction in UTXOs. The original poster had forgotten that age was even a factor in determining which UTXOs to use and couldn't think of any reason why miners care about the age of a UTXO when determining fees.</p>
