    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about committing to a blocksize increase, Matt Corallo proposes that instead of avoiding debate and pushing for consensus at all costs, the focus should be on resolving concerns before making any commitments. Three main issues are identified which would need to be addressed before a blocksize increase commitment could be made. Firstly, there needs to be implementation and measurement of proposals which decrease block propagation latency in production, including worst-case scenarios such as high packet loss or miners attempting to break the system. Secondly, better scaling technology is needed, both in terms of development and adoption by large players in the marketplace. Thirdly, there needs to be more discussion on long-term incentives within the system, including developing software which properly handles fees across the ecosystem. Overall, progress has been made on these issues, but they are still immature and require further development. Jeff Garzik agrees with Corallo's proposal, and suggests focusing on moving forward rather than on how the community got to this point.</p>
