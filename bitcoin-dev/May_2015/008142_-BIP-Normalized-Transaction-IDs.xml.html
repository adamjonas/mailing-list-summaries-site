    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed solution to fix the issue of transaction malleability would result in a hard fork, which could be difficult for some to handle. However, the use of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY would address many use cases. To address the doubling of the UTXO database, a legacy txid to normalized txid map must be present. An addition to the BIP can eliminate the need for the second index by requiring an SPV proof of the spending transaction to be included with legacy transactions. The OutPoint would include the LegacyId, SPV Proof to spending tx, spending tx, and index. This allows for a legacy transaction to be upgraded, while OutPoints that use a normalized txid do not require an SPV proof. During the transitional period after the hard fork, both txids can be used, but afterward, legacy transactions require an SPV proof to be added. This allows for old transactions with locktimes years in the future to be upgraded for spending without nodes needing to maintain two indexes.</p>
