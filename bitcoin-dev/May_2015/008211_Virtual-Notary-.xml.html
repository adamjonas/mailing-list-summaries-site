    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A website has been created to provide proof of various facts like Bitcoin funds, address ownership, Tweet, real estate value, DNS ownership, existence, web page contents and weather conditions without revealing public addresses or fund location on the blockchain. The factoids can be recorded on the blockchain by paying for the transaction with Bitcoin or PayPal. The website provides a permanent URL to the factoids it generates and an X.509 certificate that can be downloaded and kept safe in perpetuity, independent of the website. However, the site needs some user-experience love and improvement, as well as fixing payment verification problems. The weather and real estate notarization is limited to US only. Two ideas have also been proposed: first, adding a way of decentralizing the notary service log via an open-source P2P daemon and second, adding an open-source UI app to examine certificates which could prove independence from the website/service.</p>
