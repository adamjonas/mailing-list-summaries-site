    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the "replace by fee" (RBF) feature of Bitcoin. It allows users to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new one that has a higher fee. The cost savings of RBF over "child pays for parent" (CPFP) method is discussed in various cases. The first case examines the cost savings when increasing the fee on a single transaction. The second case shows how RBF can be used to pay multiple recipients in succession with huge cost savings. The third case demonstrates how wasteful multisig transactions can be optimized using RBF. The fourth case deals with UTXO defragmentation and how RBF can save up to 59% of total fees. The question remains if RBF will be included in bitcoin core 10.0.3 or remain just on Peter Todd's branch. There is also some unrelated conversation between Peter Todd and Mike Hearn regarding CPFP as an alternative to RBF. Finally, there is an aggressive comment made by joliver at airmail.cc directed towards Peter Todd, who is the Chief Scientist of ViaCoin, an altcoin with 30-second blocks and big banks as clients.</p>
