    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is proposing that reducing the block rate to 1 minute can be a better way to increase transactions/second than increasing the maximum block size. The author argues against several arguments for not reducing the block interval, including concerns about centralization, block-chain splits, security, and technical/economic implications. The author suggests that lowering the block rate can decrease the probability of block competition, and the decrease in security is only if participants wish to decrease it. The email provides evidence and research to back up these claims. The author also suggests that upgrades to SPV wallets and optimizations to the protocol can help reduce the impact on mobile devices and bandwidth. The email concludes that there have been insufficient testing and research into reducing the block rate but argues that the changes required are minor compared to other proposals. Overall, the email encourages consideration of reducing the block rate as opposed to increasing the block size through miners voting.</p>
