    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and another individual, the topic of possible changes to the semantics on nSequence was discussed. Mike Hearn suggested that any changes should be gated by a high bit or something so that the original meaning remains available for when resource scheduling and update flood damping are implemented. He believed that out of all proposed protocols, Satoshi's is still the most powerful. The other individual argued that their proposal was constructed to maintain the semantics of Satoshi's original construction and higher sequence numbers would be able to hit the chain earlier. They questioned if they had failed in capturing the original intent.</p>
