        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2015, Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner engaged in an email conversation that discussed the connection between the block size debate and creating a fee market. According to the author, there already exists a marketplace for block space, but miners are not being competitive enough. To address this issue, Lerner proposed a new way to create a fee market that does not depend on the blockchain limit. His proposal requires a hardfork but has minimum impact in the code and economics.Lerner's solution is to require that the set of fees collected in a block has a dispersion below a threshold, using the Coefficient of Variation. This means that if there are many transactions containing high fees in a block, free transactions cannot be included. Spamming users would need to use higher fees only if the remaining users in the community raise their fees. The proposal would also help solve the tragedy-of-the-commons fee problem. Increasing the block size would prevent miners from filling the block with spamming txs and destroying the market that is being created.The email thread also mentions various methods tried previously to pay miners fees without pre-negotiation, including adding anyone-can-spend output for fees and negotiating out-of-band with the miner previously. Lerner concludes that alternate fee-paying methods without pre-negotiation were not reliable or cost-saving options. He suggests reducing the block rate to 1 minute, using the CoVar method, and not allowing spending outputs in the same block they were created to improve the situation.However, Lerner raised a question about whether the system can be gamed. It was mentioned that users have the ability to pay fees or a portion of fees out of band to miner(s), which is undetectable to the network. This behavior has been observed since at least 2011 in two forms: treating transactions that paid miners directly via outputs as having that much more in fees and taking contracts for fast processing for identified transactions. The suggestion made by Lerner was seen as further rewarding this behavior and allowing bypassing of controls.In conclusion, the discussion between Gregory Maxwell and Sergio Lerner in 2015 raised questions about whether the Bitcoin network could be gamed and proposed five methods for users to pay fees to miners. Sergio Lerner presented a new way to create a fee market that does not depend on the blockchain limit by requiring a dispersion below a threshold using the Coefficient of Variation. However, it is impossible to enforce consensus rules concerning fees because it is easy to pay miners out of band. This behavior has been observed since at least 2011 and raises concerns about bypassing controls. Overall, Lerner's proposal seems to offer a potential solution that could benefit both users and miners while preventing spamming and ensuring a fair distribution of fees.</p>
