    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alex Mizrahi stated that the equation for miners has many variables. He mentioned that there is no disadvantage if the network speed is the same between the miners. However, if there is a difference in network speed, the miner is incentivized to invest in their network infrastructure. The discussion was in response to Chun mentioning that his pool is on a slow network, and thus bigger blocks give it a disadvantage. Orphan rate, which is proportional to block size, also plays a role. Alex originally said that those who make big blocks have a disadvantage, but now acknowledges that a disadvantage does exist for those on a slow network. The conversation highlights the complexity of the Bitcoin mining process and how various factors can impact a miner's success.</p>
