    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Wladimir J. van der Laan, a developer, has proposed a schedule for the release window of version 0.11. He has suggested May 1st as the soft translation string freeze and to open Transifex translations for 0.11 while finalizing and closing translation for 0.9. He has also recommended May 15th as the feature freeze and string freeze. On June 1st, he suggests splitting off 0.11 branch, tagging and releasing 0.11.0rc1 and starting merging for 0.12 on master branch. The aim is to release 0.11.0 final by July 1st. In contrast to previous releases, Wladimir wishes to be more strict about the dates. However, last-minute critical issues may interfere with the planning. The release will not be held up for features, and anything that does not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to the next release scheduled for the end of the year.</p>
