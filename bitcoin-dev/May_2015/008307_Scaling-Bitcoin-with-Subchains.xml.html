    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a proposal by Andrew Poelstra to scale Bitcoin without increasing the block size. The proposal involves creating child chains that are linked to the main blockchain and can be used to store transactions, thus increasing the total capacity of the network. The child chains are dependent on the parent chain and must follow its consensus rules. The proposal also addresses concerns about decentralization by suggesting that participants should be able to produce the devices needed to participate in the system without relying on central powers. Some developers agree with the proposal and suggest ways to implement it, while others raise questions or objections. One developer points out that the proposal does not address specific sidechain problems described in previous research. Gavin Andresen objects to the proposal as well but does not provide an explanation for his objections. Mike Hearn raises concerns about the costs and limitations of hard drives and suggests that tape backup could be a more viable storage option. He also questions Poelstra's motivations for the proposal and asks if he is driven by philosophical beliefs or self-interest. Despite the debates and differing opinions, Poelstra believes that his proposal is a good candidate for scaling Bitcoin in a way that does not require a block size increase. He suggests that the proposal could be implemented through a harmless soft fork that would allow nodes to switch to a better scaling protocol if one became available.</p>
