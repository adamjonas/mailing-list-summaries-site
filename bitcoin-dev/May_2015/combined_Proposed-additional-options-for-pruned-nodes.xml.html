        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion revolves around the issue of security being weakened when a small part of the chain is attacked, resulting in network-wide Denial of Service (DoS) since nobody can synchronize. It is suggested that this attack could be considered as bandwidth exhaustion DoS attack on archive nodes. The option of having only two kinds of full nodes, archive and pruned, has some disadvantages, such as archives taking up huge disk and bandwidth cost. The suggestion is to have fractional nodes that will provide incremental ways to participate when people cannot provide the entire resource. The issue lies with the block sync horizon/cliff, which is the average number of blocks the 90th percentile of nodes need to sync. Semi-pruned nodes must keep X blocks after which they must fall back to archive nodes for older data. Previous suggestions included having a definition of pruned, meaning that one would serve at least the last 288 from their tip, and another flag for "I have at least the last 2016". However, the probability of a block being fetched vs depth showed an exponential drop-off with a 50% probability at three days, plus a constant low probability.A more radical suggestion was made years ago to refuse to sync if too old and force the user to download ancient data via torrents. However, this makes the system dependent on centralized services, and Bitcoin should be complete. The ideal characteristics are listed, including block coverage locality, block storage on nodes not depending on random peers, the decision to contact a node needing O(1) communications, and so on. Though previous schemes have been proposed, something meeting all criteria has not yet been discovered.</p>
