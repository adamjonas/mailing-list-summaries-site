        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a conversation between Gavin Andresen and another individual, they discuss the possibility of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks. Gavin Andresen ran simulations to see if a large miner producing big blocks could cause a loss of profit to another miner producing smaller blocks but found that he couldn't find a network topology where this would be the case.However, if someone propagated a 20MB block, it would take at best 6 seconds for verification at current configuration, resulting in a one percent orphan rate increase. The orphan rate is about 0.5% over the past few months, but if the network floods 20MB blocks, it can be well above 2%. In addition to bandwidth issues, a 20MB block could contain an average of 50000 transactions and hundreds of thousands of sigops.The cost of bandwidth is also mentioned with a bandwidth of 30Mbps in Beijing costing $1350 per month. Cloud services are being used for block propagation due to these high costs. Based on these factors, the individual suggests that the network should only accept 5MB blocks at most.</p>
