    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate on increasing the block size of Bitcoin continues, with some advocating for a one-time increase to 20MB while others argue that a hard fork should be avoided. The concern is that a forced hard fork that isn’t universally agreed upon could damage people's belief in the value of Bitcoin, which is what gives it its worth. Forks should be hard and both sides need to recognize that belief in the value of Bitcoin might be fragile. It’s argued that if we didn't force through a 20MB fork now, and we ran into major network difficulties a year from now with no other technical solutions, we might get nearly universal agreement then. Gavin Andresen has requested people to email him objections they might have missed on the matter and he is considering contributing some version of the bigger blocksize-limit hard-fork patch to the Bitcoin-Xt fork. Ultimately, consensus comes down to what software people choose to run.</p>
