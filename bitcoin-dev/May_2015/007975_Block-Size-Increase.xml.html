    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Tom Harding and Jeff Garzik, the issue of block size was discussed. Alan had expressed that he wanted to go where Gavin's proposal suggested, which was for 20MB blocks, allowing for 140 transactions per second (tps). However, Jeff questioned where they ultimately wanted to go with block size, asking if they were trying to build a system that could handle Paypal or VISA volumes, or even all the world's coffees. He notes that it's an existential question behind block size and one that must be answered in order to inform the change being discussed today. Jeff emphasizes that any responsible project of this magnitude must have a better story than randomly picking a number out of a hat. Changing the block size is just kicking the can down the road, and they must consider what happens when they reach the end of that newly paved road.</p>
