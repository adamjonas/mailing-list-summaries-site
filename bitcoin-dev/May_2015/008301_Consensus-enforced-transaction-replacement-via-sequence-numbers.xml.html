    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Bitcoin protocol, it was mentioned that the original protocol allowed for millions of revisions of transactions, which was intended to allow for high frequency trading. The proposal being discussed aimed to maintain the semantics of Satoshi's original construction, where higher sequence numbers would be selected by miners before later transactions matured. The proposal's author suggested that with careful channel construction, sequence numbers would only need to be bumped when the channel reversed direction, making it a good approach if the app only needed to do that rarely. However, one participant in the discussion wondered if it was possible to get back to the original protocol or at least leave a path open to it, as it seemed to be a superset of all other proposals features-wise.</p>
