    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the network topology health issues that are being brought up in a debate regarding the origin node of blocks. Due to how blocks are being broadcast by miners at the moment, it is not difficult to find the origin node of these blocks. These more influential origin nodes are a minority. The debate continues with the topic of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks. Gavin Andresen questions how that would happen and runs some simulations. He could not find a network topology where a big miner producing big blocks could cause a loss of profit to another miner producing smaller blocks. However, if someone propagates a 20MB block, it will take at best 6 seconds for them to receive to verify it at the current configuration resulting in a one percent orphan rate increase. Or they can mine the next block only on the previous block's header, in which case, the network would see many more transaction-less blocks. Their orphan rate is about 0.5% over the past few months. If the network floods 20MB blocks, it can be well above 2%. Besides bandwidth, a 20MB block could contain an average of 50000 transactions, hundreds of thousands of sigops. In the end, they can accept 5MB block at most.</p>
