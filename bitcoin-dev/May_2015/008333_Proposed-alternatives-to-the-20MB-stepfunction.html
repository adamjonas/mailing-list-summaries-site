    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille, the topic of increasing block size was discussed. While Andresen expressed his belief that block size should increase, he also believes that it should only be done after sufficient technological growth has been demonstrated to mitigate any risks. When asked to specify which risks he is worried about, Andresen referred to his blog posts on the subject, which can be found on his website. He did acknowledge the risk of unforeseen consequences from a sudden jump to a 20MB maximum block size, but suggested that a dynamic increase would solve that problem.</p>
