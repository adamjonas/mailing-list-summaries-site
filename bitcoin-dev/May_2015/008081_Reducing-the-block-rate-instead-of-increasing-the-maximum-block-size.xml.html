    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email argues that increasing the maximum block size is not the best way to increase transactions per second in Bitcoin. The author suggests decreasing the block rate to 1 minute while keeping the block size limit to 1 megabyte or increasing it from a lower value such as 100 kilobytes. The author backs up their claims with many hours of research simulating the Bitcoin network under different conditions. The email addresses and responds to arguments against reducing the block interval, including the potential for centralization, an increased probability of a blockchain split, decreased security, and insufficient testing. The email concludes that there are no good arguments against lowering the block rate. The changes required to lower the block rate comprise no more than 15 lines of code, much less than the number of lines modified by Gavin's 20MB patch. There is also no significant impact on mobile wallets, as they can easily catch up with the chain.</p>
