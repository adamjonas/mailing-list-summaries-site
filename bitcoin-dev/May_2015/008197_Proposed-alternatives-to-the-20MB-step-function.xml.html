    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and an unknown individual, they discussed the possibility of cleaning up old UTXOs. They point out that as people spend their money, the old UTXOs would be used up and included in the cost function. UTXOs from below 355,000 and above 375,000 are included, creating incentive problems for a future threshold change. Additionally, they discussed the possibility of a new opcode, OP_LOCK_BYTES, being added to allow transactions to store bytes, which would be useful for channels. The block limit would have three limits: an absolute hard limit of 100MB, a hard limit of 30MB, and a soft limit of 10MB. Transactions would include scriptPubKey information when broadcasting them, which the writer describes as "brilliant." A BIP has been written about this idea but is still in the draft stage. Links to the BIP and fork can be found on Github.</p>
