    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Justus Ranvier and Jeff Garzik discuss the potential implications of Bitcoin's restricted transaction rate capability. Garzik argues that a change in the system would have significant economic implications, as it would pick winners and losers and create moral hazard. Ranvier adds that there are other projects that could benefit from filling in the gap left by Bitcoin's limitations, and if Bitcoin were to fill that gap, those other projects would lose. The question is then raised whether decisions about Bitcoin development should take into account the desires of competing projects. Peter Todd later chimes in to argue that assuming basic civility among those involved in the discussion is more productive than assuming dishonest intentions, unless proven otherwise.</p>
