        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal of partially-connected nodes that can throttle bandwidth demands is presented by the author. These nodes have a binary requirement for connection and different storage options, but the implementation of a throttling option would reduce bandwidth demands for weaker nodes. The process involves five steps, including an option for user-specified total bandwidth usage, reducing connections and relaying, partial connectivity or cycling on/off, an auto setting for traffic management, and reducing the minimum requirement for full validation. In the email chain, Jeff Garzik raises a concern about security being weakened when an attacker can DoS a small part of the chain through a small number of nodes. Gregory Maxwell lists seven desirable characteristics from prior discussions about block coverage, such as locality, uniformity, and compact communication. He proposes two schemes that come close to meeting all criteria but fail one. One scheme based on reservoir sampling gives uniform selection but needs O(height) work to figure out what blocks a peer has. The other scheme based on consistent hashes has log(height) computation but may result in a node needing to refetch an old block range, creating re-balancing traffic.</p>
