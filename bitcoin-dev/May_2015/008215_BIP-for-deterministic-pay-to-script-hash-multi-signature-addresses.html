    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In February 2015, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the lack of a specification section in a script template format created by William Swanson and Eric Lombrozo. Luke Dashjr asked if the format supported arbitrary scripts or only the simplest CHECKMULTISIG case. Peter Todd suggested that the BIP be rewritten to state that all pubkeys executed by all CHECKMULTISIG opcodes would be in canonical order, with some examples to illustrate this rule. Todd expressed concern that the rule might be too restrictive for some cases and should not be enforced as an IsStandard() rule. Lombrozo had previously worked with Swanson to create the script template format, but other work prevented them from completing it fully at the time. A link to the start of the format was provided in the email chain. The email was signed with an OpenPGP signature.</p>
