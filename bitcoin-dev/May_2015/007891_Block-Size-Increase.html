    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the block size debate in Bitcoin. The speaker refers to an estimate made in an article that the block size needs to be increased by winter next year, based on previous growth patterns. They also mention that full 1 MB blocks may not happen until June 2017. The discussion then moves towards consensus and whether there has been any significant change in the debates. The speaker emphasizes the need for leadership and clear decision-making to move the process forward. They clarify that they do not believe Bitcoin is broken in the long term but find it hard to care about what happens 30 years from now. The other person advocates for waiting 12 months to see if the speaker's estimations are correct before implementing full blocks, which the speaker disagrees with. They also discuss the fee market and the need to find and remove bottlenecks for scaling.</p>
