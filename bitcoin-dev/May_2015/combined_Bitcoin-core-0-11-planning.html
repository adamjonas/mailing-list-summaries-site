        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email dated April 28, 2015, Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed a schedule for the release of version 0.11 of Bitcoin Core. The proposed schedule includes a soft translation string freeze on May 1, opening Transifex translations for 0.11, and finalizing and closing translation for 0.9. The feature and string freeze is scheduled for May 15. On June 1, the plan is to split off the 0.11 branch, tag and release 0.11.0rc1, and start merging for 0.12 on the master branch. The target is to release 0.11.0 final on July 1. Unlike previous releases, the intention is to be more strict about the dates. However, it is acknowledged that last-minute critical issues may affect the planning. It is also stated that the release will not be held up for features, and anything that does not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to the next release scheduled for the end of the year.In another email, it is mentioned that the soonest implementation of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY on Bitcoin will be around summer 2016. This feature has already been adopted on Viacoin and a few other altcoins. To accelerate the adoption of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, it is suggested to release a v0.12 with just a CLTV soft-fork as soon as the BIP66 softfork triggers. The main reason for accelerating CLTV is scalability, as it provides robust fixes for scalability issues. It is noted that payment channel schemes can start with Jeremy Spilman's scheme and later transition to CLTV, but this would require writing extra code that may later become deprecated.The proposed schedule for the release of version 0.11 has been shared with the community. The deadline for the soft translation string freeze, opening Transifex translations for 0.11, and finalizing and closing translation for 0.9 is set for May 1. The feature and string freeze will take place on May 15. On June 1, the plan is to split off the 0.11 branch, tag and release 0.11.0rc1, and start merging for 0.12 on the master branch. The aim is to release 0.11.0 final on July 1. While there is an intention to be more strict about the dates, it is acknowledged that last-minute critical issues could impact the planning. However, the release will not be delayed for features, and anything that does not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to the next release scheduled for the end of the year.</p>
