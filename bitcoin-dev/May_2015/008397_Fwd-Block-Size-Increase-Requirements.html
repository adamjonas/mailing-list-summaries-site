    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on Bitcoin-development mailing list, Alex Mizrahi mentioned that if a miner is on a slow network, then he is at a slight disadvantage. Chun, who owns a mining pool, said that his pool is on a slow network and thus bigger blocks give it a disadvantage as the orphan rate is proportional to block size. However, Ricardo Filipe argued that there is no disadvantage if the network speed is the same between the miners. He also added that the equation for miners has many variables, and if there is a difference in network speed, the miner is incentivized to invest in their network infrastructure. Nevertheless, he cautioned against assuming that investing in internet network infrastructure is a free or open market everywhere.</p>
