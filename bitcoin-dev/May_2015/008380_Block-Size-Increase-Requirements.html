    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a correspondence with Peter Todd, Gavin Andresen discusses the lack of compromise from others in the Bitcoin space for a slow growth solution. Todd asks for specifics on this, as he hasn't seen any proposal that could be turned into a pull request. Andresen defends his analysis by stating he simulated a variety of connectivities and used worst case scenarios for his analysis. Todd claims that Andresen's assumption that connections between miners are direct is too optimistic. Andresen clarifies that he did not simulate all miners directly connected to each other, but notes that miners are highly connected to each other regardless. Todd suggests that the permissive and unregulated environment of Bitcoin mining is easily subject to change, but Andresen questions how this would affect the need for bigger blocks and why 1MB blocks are not subject to change. Andresen also links to an article discussing the issues surrounding Bitcoin and government regulation.</p>
