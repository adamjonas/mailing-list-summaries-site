        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion revolves around calculating bandwidth for highly connected miners who could have 30-100 node connections. The traffic estimates need to be increased by that factor. For 100MB blocks, 30-100 Mbps and $60-$100 per day data costs are required. The Aliyun and Linode cloud services are used for block propagation, and as of May 2015, the price is 0.13 U.S. dollars per GB for 100Mbps connectivity at Aliyun. That speed can handle 20MB blocks with no problem. Each 20MB block is estimated to be 100MB of data up/down the wire, but after optimization, it should be 40MB.Based on this estimation, the cost will be less than $2 per day in bandwidth. A single cross-border TCP connection would be slower than 12.5 MB/s, but 1.3Mbps or less would be sufficient. In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and gb, the topic of calculating bandwidth for highly connected miners was discussed. Gb suggested that the traffic estimates needed to be increased by a factor of 30-100 due to the number of node connections a miner could have. However, Andresen pointed out that randomly connected gossip networks, such as the Bitcoin p2p network, operate differently and that bandwidth is roughly O(N), where N is the number of bytes relayed to everybody.Andresen also mentioned that the overhead of 'inv' messages could increase the bandwidth slightly, but this would not be a problem for years. Overall, the discussion provides insights into the requirements for calculating bandwidth for highly connected miners and the factors to consider while estimating the costs. The use of cloud services for block propagation and the optimization of data transfer also play a crucial role in reducing costs.</p>
