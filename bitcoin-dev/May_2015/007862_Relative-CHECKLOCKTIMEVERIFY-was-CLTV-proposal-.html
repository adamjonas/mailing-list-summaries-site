    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion on May 4, 2015, Jorge Tim√≥n described his attempt to fix a proposal by Mark Friedenbach regarding RCLTV (Relative CheckLockTime Verify). However, he realized that the proposal did not need fixing as it was already reorg safe. This means that there is no need for the 100 block restriction and script validation can be kept independent from the utxo. The way RCLTV works is that the operator takes a relative_height parameter and checks that the nSequence of the input is lower than that parameter. In addition, a new check at the transaction level is implemented to ensure that coins are not spent before the specified height. It should be noted that dropping timestamp only refers to RCLTV and not CLTV (CheckLockTime Verify), which requires timestamps for practical trust fund use cases where the exact date a future block will be mined on is unpredictable if it's far enough in the future.</p>
