    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the process and order of decision-making for a fork in the Bitcoin community. The traditional method involves getting consensus on IRC, GitHub, and other platforms before pitching to the general public. However, this approach has led to circular arguments and is not accessible to all members. Instead, some suggest starting a thread on the list for discussion. One specific concern is related to block sizes, which has been debated on various platforms. Gavin proposed increasing block sizes and answered objections beforehand. However, some argue that more research and software development should be done before committing to a block size increase. Gavin has run simulations with modified full nodes using real data that suggest 20mb blocks work fine. Nonetheless, further research and software development are necessary before making any decisions.</p>
