    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate on the scalability of Bitcoin continues as Gavin Andresen releases a blog post asking for objections to increasing the block size limit. Alex Morcos warns that forcing a hard fork that isn't universally agreed upon could damage belief in Bitcoin, which is what gives it value. He argues that forks should be hard and recognized as a fragile thing. Furthermore, he suggests that if they didn't force through a 20MB fork now, and they ran into major network difficulties a year from now and had no other technical solutions, then maybe they would get nearly universal agreement. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, also contributes to the discussion.</p>
