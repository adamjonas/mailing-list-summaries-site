    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eric Lombrozo agrees with Drak's assessment that politics are inevitable in any consensus protocol seeking dynamism. He argues that while the block size discussion is necessary, it is only serving as an example of the political issues that need to be addressed. Some protocol updates will be highly controversial and lack a process for deciding these issues. Lombrozo suggests that external input may be required, such as a vote or hashing power. He also proposes building the dynamics of hard forks into the model rather than avoiding them altogether. Lombrozo acknowledges that hard forks are easy, but the difficulty lies in merging different branches. He suggests learning from git and designing the network to allow for merging.</p>
