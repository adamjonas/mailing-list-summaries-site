    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a proposal to allow miners to select the difficulty of each block they mine within a certain range. This would effectively raise or lower the maximum block size for that block based on the difference in difficulty. However, this proposal has been met with criticism as it may encourage 0-transaction blocks and lead to a tragedy of the commons. The effective maximum block size would be defined by the optimal size for rational miners, which could result in a crippled network. Additionally, it could also lead to manipulation of the average block confirmation time and inflation rate of Bitcoin currency, undermining its core value.</p>
