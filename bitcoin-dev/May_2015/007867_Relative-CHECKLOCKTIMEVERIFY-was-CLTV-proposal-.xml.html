    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion among developers on the Bitcoin-development mailing list focused on the semantics of nSequence and a proposed change to its function in order to allow for relative locktime. The proposed change would make it so that transactions with an nSequence value less than or equal to their input's sequence number could be considered valid after a certain block height. Some developers expressed concerns about this change, arguing that it could reduce confidence in the currency if previously valid transactions became invalid. One suggested workaround was to have a way to enable relative locktime in the sigScript by extending Peter Todd's suggestion. Another proposed solution involved using a simple pattern match to determine whether the script should fail unless it was the first opcode in the script, although some felt that this option was less flexible and unnecessary.</p>
