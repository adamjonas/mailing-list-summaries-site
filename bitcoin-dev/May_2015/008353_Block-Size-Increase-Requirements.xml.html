    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Matt Corallo, Corallo expressed concern over the lack of implementation for proposals to significantly decrease block propagation latency. He noted that this could lead to miners creating smaller blocks which would render max block size irrelevant. Corallo also called for better scaling technology and conclusions regarding long-term incentives within the system. In response, Andresen provided links to his analysis on the impact of bigger blocks on bigger miners and his thoughts on when the block reward goes away. He also questioned the connection between the max block size and the need for better scaling technology.</p>
