    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between two Bitcoin developers, Adam Back and Raystonn, has been revealed. Raystonn thanks Adam for inventing hashcash, which is the basis for Bitcoin. Raystonn proposes an idea of scaling Bitcoin with subchains and clarifies it as different from what Adam proposed earlier. He suggests that a tree structure of blockchains is necessary to scale transactions and talks about the advantages of having multiple 1MB chains over one 10MB chain. Raystonn believes that the actual way that the blockchains interact can be worked out in the future. He also discusses the need for an "exit plan" in case a better idea comes along and suggests a way to reverse the soft fork. In response, Gavin Andresen recommends implementing the proposed solution in Bitcoin Core wallet and asks for mockups of what the experience would look like for users. Gavin also questions the complexity of the proposed solution and suggests opting for a simpler solution if possible.</p>
