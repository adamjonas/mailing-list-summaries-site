    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 31st, 2015 Matt Whitlock sent an email discussing Gavin's proposal to move Bitcoin forward with his own proposal, regardless of the agreement of other Bitcoin Core committers. While some miners and merchants may support the idea of larger blocks, there is a substantial risk that it could fail, so until there is actual consensus among the technical community it is best not to take the risk. However, doing nothing will virtually assure that Bitcoin XT takes over, for better or worse. The proposal is to gradually raise the block size limit using an approximately smooth function, without a step discontinuity, from 1 MB to 20 MB over the course of several years, beginning next March. It would be far more helpful if we focused on stuff that helps enable level 2 technologies so that Bitcoin can actually scale. Extending blocksize now would be nothing more than a political move. In order for bitcoin to survive, changes must be based on well thought out and discussed technical merits and not the result of political pressure.</p>
