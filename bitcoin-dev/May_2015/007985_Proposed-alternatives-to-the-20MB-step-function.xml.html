    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, several ideas were raised regarding Bitcoin's hard block size limit that did not receive much attention. One idea suggests that the size limit should be determined by a function of actual block sizes over a trailing sampling period, allowing for organic scaling rather than human guesswork. Another proposal suggests determining the limit by a vote of miners, with each miner embedding their desired limit in coinbase transactions. The effective limit would be the size with the most votes within a sliding window of recent blocks. A third idea suggests the limit should be a function of blockchain length, linearly or quadratically, for smoother scaling. While the author supports any of these proposals, they do not support Mike Hearn's suggestion of jumping immediately to a 20 MB limit, as it avoids solving the problem and does so controversially.</p>
