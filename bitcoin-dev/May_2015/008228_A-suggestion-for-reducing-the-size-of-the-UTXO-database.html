    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The user has configured an app to connect only to their own trusted Bitcoin node, which means that there is only one active connection at most. However, the app wants to ensure that the transactions it makes have propagated across the network, and setting a trusted node prevents this from happening. The logic of the app may need to be modified so that if a trusted node is set, the app assumes that the user knows what they are doing and transactions made by the user always work. It is important to note that the Bitcoin network can change in backwards incompatible ways.</p>
