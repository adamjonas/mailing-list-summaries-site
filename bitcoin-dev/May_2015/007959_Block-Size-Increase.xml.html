    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has claimed that the network would be highly centralized if there was fee pressure. He was challenged to provide evidence for his assertion, which he failed to do. The comments were made on May 7th, 2015 and published as part of an email chain on the bitcoin-development mailing list. The email also contained PGP signatures to verify authenticity, and an attachment containing public keys.</p>
