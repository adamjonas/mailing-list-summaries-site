    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message dated May 7, 2015, Jeff Garzik wrote that raising the block size limit would be a human decision to favor some users over others, prevent an active and competitive free fee market from developing at 1MB, keep transaction fees low to incentivize Bitcoin adoption, and value adoption over decentralization. However, none of these assertions have been proven true yet are constantly cited as if they have been. The term "decentralization" is frequently used without being precisely defined in a way that would allow for such proofs to be debated. There should be a debate on those points, and people presenting points on both sides should take the time to show their work and explain the methodology they used to reach their conclusions.</p>
