    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the conversation is about the centralization of decision-making in a git repository. Mike Hearn expresses concern over the idea that a single person, such as Gavin, could have authority equal to all other committers and that this would lead to chaos. He suggests that there must be a single decision maker for any given codebase. However, Bryan disagrees with this perspective, stating that git repositories don't work in a centralized manner. Instead, every developer has their own local copy of the git repository and is the "single decision maker" for the artifact that they compile. Each developer synchronizes their repository with others and merges changes from specific remote branches that they have received. Bryan's response suggests that the decentralized nature of git repositories allows for each developer to have control over their own branch and the artifacts that they compile, while still being able to collaborate and merge changes with others. The conversation ends with a link to Bryan's website and contact information.</p>
