    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2015, Sergio Lerner presented a new solution to create a fee market that does not depend on the blockchain limit. The proposed solution involves requiring the set of fees collected in a block to have a dispersion below a threshold calculated using the Coefficient of Variation. If the CoVar is higher than a fixed threshold, the block would be considered invalid. However, it is impossible to enforce consensus rules concerning fees because it is easy to pay miners out of band. For example, transaction fees could be paid by including anyone-can-spend outputs in transactions and having miners add a transaction at the end of their block collecting these outputs. Furthermore, prohibiting this method could lead to the creation of fee addresses where people put individual outputs for those addresses in their transactions.</p>
