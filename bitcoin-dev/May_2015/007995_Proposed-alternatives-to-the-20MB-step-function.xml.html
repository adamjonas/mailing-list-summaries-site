    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker is expressing his liking for the idea of bitcoin days destroyed. He also appreciates other ideas presented on the bitcointalk forums but mentions the challenge of wading through all the proposals. He suggests that any proposal should be accompanied by code that implements it. The speaker mentions that he is not the bottleneck and that others need to convince committers that something needs to be done now-ish, and their idea is good. In an email from Joel Joonatan Kaartinen, he suggested basing the maximum block size on the bitcoin days destroyed in transactions included in the block. It has potential for both scaling and keeping up a constant fee pressure. The suggestion would stop spamming and increase the block size maximum when there are many real transactions waiting for inclusion. Gavin Andresen is the author of the email.</p>
