    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from May 7, 2015, Mike Hearn asked for a specific and credible plan that would allow Bitcoin to keep growing within the next 12 months. He was not satisfied with vague suggestions such as using the Lightning network or doing more research, and instead called for a concrete plan with attached dates and a strong chance of being deployed in time. It's unclear where the 12-month timeframe originated from, as it was not explicitly stated in the email exchange.</p>
