    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Florian Tschorsch, a research scholar, expressed his interest in Bitcoin and realized that there is no comprehensive survey paper available on the subject. He observed the activities of the Bitcoin community and decided to contribute to this field by creating a technical report which can serve as a survey paper for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Florian shared the link to the report and invited feedback from the readers to improve the quality of future revisions. Daniel, a reader of Florian's report, appreciated his work and suggested he should take a look at another research paper about Bitcoin & co authored by Joseph Bonneau. Furthermore, Daniel advertised his own work which focuses on the difficulty mechanism of Bitcoin, offering an official publication as well as a preprint without paywall. He wished Florian good luck with his further research.</p>
