    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the soft-limit of block size in Bitcoin, Tier Nolan proposed the idea of a "miner" flag to be added for the network. This flag would reject 4MB blocks and not build on them when in "miner mode". However, Peter Todd argued that adding this flag would make it easy for attackers to identify miners and launch denial-of-service attacks against them. He further commented that such an implementation would also increase the risk of double-spending attacks against merchants as they would accept larger blocks while miners would only build on smaller ones. Todd pointed out that pools already get attacked through their work submission systems and getting attacked via their nodes as well would be disastrous.</p>
