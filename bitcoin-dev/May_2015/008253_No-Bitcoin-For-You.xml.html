    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion took place between Jim Phillips and Thy Shizzle on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The main topic of discussion was how to increase transaction capacity for Bitcoin. Phillips argued that the network was not currently constrained by disk, CPU, or RAM, but rather by bandwidth. He suggested expanding the block size to 20MB as soon as possible to increase capacity by 20-fold. He also noted that concerns about centralization of relays should be unfounded since there are enough ISPs and cloud compute providers in the world.On the other hand, Shizzle disagreed with Phillips' proposal, arguing that 20MB blocks would slow down block propagation and blow out confirmation times. Instead, he suggested decreasing the time it takes to create a 1MB block to increase transaction throughput while retaining current propagation times. Gabe Appleton raised concerns about changing the block time affecting supply curves due to truncation. However, Phillips dismissed these concerns as trivial and pointed out that the cost of running a full node on a leased server with multiple 1Gbps connections is almost zero.Finally, James G. Phillips IV shared a quote from David Ogilvy and reminded readers that his message was created with 100% recycled electrons.The Bitcoin-development mailing list serves as an open forum for discussions related to the development of Bitcoin.
