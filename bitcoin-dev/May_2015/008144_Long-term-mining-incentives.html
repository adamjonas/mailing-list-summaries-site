    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Alex Mizrahi explains that his Bitcoin node couldn't connect to any legitimate nodes because either his router or his ISP's router was hijacked, resulting in the fake chain he received being confirmed by Bitcoin Core. He argues that even encrypted connections are pointless without authentication and that it is part of the security model to be able to connect to at least one honest node. Headers first mean that a synced node cannot be knocked off the main chain without winning the POW race, and checkpoints can be replaced with a minimum amount of POW for initial sync to prevent spam of low POW blocks.</p>
