    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Roy Badami, the former commented that he wouldn't modify his node if a change was introduced that perpetually offered 100 BTC subsidy per block, even if 99% of miners went along with it. Badami responded by stating that in this scenario, Bitcoin would be dead. He further explained that if the fork that Wuille preferred had only 1% of the hash power, it would be vulnerable to not just a 51% attack but also a 501% attack, while only receiving one block every 16 hours. Ultimately, Badami noted that any change to the Bitcoin code would require convincing people and ensuring that they modified their code.</p>
