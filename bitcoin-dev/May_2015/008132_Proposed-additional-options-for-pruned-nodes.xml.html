    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Daniel Kraft suggested dividing the range of all blocks into intervals with exponentially growing size. A system was proposed where a node would broadcast 3 pieces of information including Seed (16 bits), M_bits_lsb (1 bit) and N (7 bits). The formula used for exponential increase was M = 1 > 2)) * 2.5MB, where groups of 4 were linearly interpolated. The sizes were calculated as Size(0) = 10 MB, Size(1) = 12.5MB, Size(2) = 15 MB, Size(3) = 17.5MB, Size(4) = 20MB, Size(5) = 25MB, Size(6) = 30MB, Size(7) = 35MB and Size(8) = 40MB. A node should store as much of its last start as possible by assuming start 0, 5, and 8 were "hits" but the node had a max size of 60MB. It can store 0 and 5 and have 25MB left. When approaching a transition point for N, a node would select a block height within 25,000 of the transition point and begin downloading the new runs it needs. Decreasing N only causes previously accepted runs to be invalidated.New nodes should use the higher M if they are near a transition point, say within 100,000. This spreads out the upgrade over around a year, with only a small number of nodes upgrading at any time. Finally, Size(255) was calculated using pow(2, 31) * 17.5MB = 35,840 TB.</p>
