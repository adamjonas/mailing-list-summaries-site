    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation thread discusses some interesting issues related to Bitcoin mining. The first issue raised is related to how one can know who was the first in the chain. A node that gains an advantage by being closer to where more transactions happen would make mining unfair. The second issue discussed is regarding a merchant causing block number 1 million to effectively have a minting fee of 50BTC, which could lead to the tragedy of the commons problem. Mike Hearn responds positively to Tier's solution, which is not elaborated upon in the email thread. The email ends with an advertisement for a monitoring support service with deep dive visibility.</p>
