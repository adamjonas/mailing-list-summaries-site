    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers, Peter Todd expressed his concern that using a "-miner" flag to follow rules about smaller blocks would allow attackers to find and launch denial-of-service attacks on miners. However, others in the group argued that this would only reveal miner nodes if someone sent the node a solved block that was valid in every way except for the block size, which is not trivial as it requires wasting an entire block's worth of energy.There was also a suggestion to reject 4MB blocks when in "miner mode" and even track the miner and non-miner chain tip, meaning miners would refuse to build on 5MB blocks while merchants and general users would accept them. However, some argued that this could increase the chance of double-spending merchants, but this issue could be mitigated by counting confirmations differently. Confirmations should come from blocks following the miners' more strict rule set. To address this issue, Tier's suggestion was to have the default client limit set to some higher number, and have miners agree out of band on the latest block size limit. There could even be a way to vote into the blockchain. The group seemed receptive to this idea.</p>
