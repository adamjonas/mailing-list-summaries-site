    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the proper discourse for implementing block size increase in Bitcoin. While some argue that consensus should be reached on IRC, Github and mailing list before presenting to the general public, others believe that this is not an effective method of decision-making as it excludes a large part of the community. The block size increase is intricately tied to Bitcoin's incentive structure, which many of the development community are more familiar with than the general public. It is suggested that more research should be done into developing software around supporting larger block sizes so people feel comfortable doing it in six months. This suggestion is met with agreement but requires further discussion in a new thread.</p>
