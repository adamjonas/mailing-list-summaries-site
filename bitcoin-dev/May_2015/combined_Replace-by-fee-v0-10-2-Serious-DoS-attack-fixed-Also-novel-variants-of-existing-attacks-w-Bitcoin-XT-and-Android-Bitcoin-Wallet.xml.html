        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, has released a patch for the Bitcoin Core v0.10.2 release which addresses a serious Denial of Service (DoS) attack that was present in previous releases. The upgrade is mandatory for miners and strongly recommended for relay nodes. Prior to this patch, replacements that spent outputs of conflicting transactions were accepted, leading to orphaned transactions and a potential bandwidth DoS attack for relay nodes, while mining nodes would cause a Bitcoin crash when CreateNewBlock() was called. The issue was discovered by Suhas Daftuar.Additionally, Todd discovered an issue with Andresen/Harding's relay doublespends patch included in Bitcoin XT, which fails to verify that doublespends don't spend outputs of the transactions they conflict with. This means that Schildbach's Android Bitcoin Wallet fails to detect this case, displaying the transaction as a valid unconfirmed transaction, potentially allowing the user to be defrauded with a doublespend. In summary, the release of the replace-by-fee patch by Peter Todd fixes a serious DoS attack in Bitcoin Core v0.10.2 and ensures that replacements that spend outputs of conflicting transactions are no longer accepted. Todd also discovered an issue with the Andresen/Harding's relay doublespends patch in Bitcoin XT, which could lead to double-spending fraud in the Schildbach's Android Bitcoin Wallet. Upgrading is mandatory for miners and strongly recommended for relay nodes.</p>
