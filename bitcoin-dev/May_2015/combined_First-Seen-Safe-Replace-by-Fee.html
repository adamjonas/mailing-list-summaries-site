        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context discusses First-Seen-Safe Replace-by-Fee (FSS-RBF), which is a modification to Bitcoin Core implementation that allows users effective ways of getting "stuck" transactions unstuck and uses blockchain space efficiently, while not changing the status quo with regard to zeroconf. FSS RBF is a compromise between the current “first-seen” mempool behavior and replace-by-fee (RBF). Transactions may be replaced by higher-fee paying transactions, provided that all outputs in the previous transaction are still paid by the replacement, keeping the "first-seen" behavior intact. The benefits of FSS RBF include cost savings of 11% to 34%+ and RBF can increase fees even in cases where the original transaction didn't have a change output. In addition to the above, there are several usage scenarios for FSS RBF. However, there are potential risks associated with transaction replacement in Bitcoin. Replacement refers to changing the input signatures of a transaction after it has been broadcasted and seen by observers. Certain payments could be part of a larger deal with unknown connections to other parts, which could lead to issues if paying parties are kicked out of the deal or do not learn about it right away.The email conversation between Tom Harding and others discusses the complexities of bitcoin transactions. Tom expresses confusion about the relationship between bitcoin transactions and real-world deals, highlighting the need for more specific definitions. The discussion also covers changing signatures in transactions and how it affects parties involved, as well as Armory simulfunding transactions and the possibility of one signer's input being replaced after broadcasting. There is also a conversation on the potential consequences of changing inputs in transactions and the importance of warning signers of multi-input transactions. Furthermore, the context explores the potential consequences of not contributing to a bitcoin transaction, including the risk of compromising the entire transaction if paying parties are kicked out of the deal or do not learn about it right away. The conversation also delves into the complexities of bitcoin transactions and the various factors that can influence them. Specifically, Tom Harding expresses confusion about the bitcoin transaction's relationship with a real-world "deal" and suggests that more specific definitions are needed. Additionally, the email highlights two cases where increasing fees on bitcoin transactions can be done more efficiently using FSS-RBF rather than Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). It involves adding a new input and increasing the change output value, resulting in cost savings ranging from 11% to 34%+. In some cases, if an unspent output has a greater value than one of the outputs spent by the original transaction, it can be replaced in the vin txin set, resulting in a 34% savings compared to CPFP. Care must be taken to ensure that multiple rounds of defragmenting outputs result in at least one input unchanged.It is worth noting that allowing the content of blocks to change other than by mining a competing chain would be a significant change to Bitcoin's design. RBF applies only to pending transactions in the mempool awaiting incorporation into a block. If the pending transaction is incorporated into a block at the same time that the spender is constructing and publishing a replacement for that pending transaction, the replacement transaction would be rejected by the peer network as a double spend because it conflicts with the now confirmed original tx. An implementation that wishes to take advantage of RBF will still need to have a "plan B" implementation path to handle the corner case of a replacement tx being rejected as a double spend. Overall, the context provides insights into the intricacies of bitcoin transactions, including the potential risks and benefits associated with different mempool policies. FSS RBF adds additional criteria to replace-by-fee before allowing a transaction t1 to be replaced with t2 including: all outputs of t1 exist in t2 and pay >= the value in t1; all outputs of t1 are unspent; the order of outputs in t2 is the same as in t1 with additional new outputs at the end of the output list; t2 only conflicts with a single transaction, t1; and t2 does not spend any outputs of t1. FSS RBF should be submitted to bitcoin/bitcoin because inconsistently deployed FSS RBF invites attacks. All wallets should treat conflicting incoming transactions as equivalent so long as the transaction outputs owned by them do not change, and must not assume TXIDs are fixed until confirmed in the blockchain.</p>
