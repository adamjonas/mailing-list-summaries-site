    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2015, Alan Reiner, a Bitcoin developer, expressed concerns from corporate clients about the scalability of Bitcoin. The clients were worried that the limit of seven transactions per second (tps) would not be able to handle the economic activity they expect it to handle, and investing time in such a system might not be worth it. Reiner, however, assured them that 7 tps was not the final answer. It is unclear what the corporate clients wanted to use Bitcoin for specifically, but there was a discussion about why they wanted to use it.</p>
