    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Mike Hearn and another individual on the Bitcoin development mailing list, concerns were raised about the process of proposing changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The individual suggested that consensus should be reached among developers before presenting changes to the wider public, but Hearn argued that this approach may not be effective, citing previous arguments over block sizes in IRC. Hearn also noted that while the general public may have a say in running software they prefer, the development community must work together to update all software across the ecosystem. When asked about a specific credible alternative to committing to block size increases immediately, the individual suggested more research into supporting larger block sizes and developing software around it so people feel comfortable doing it in six months. Gavin Andresen had already run simulations across the internet with modified full nodes using 20mb blocks, using real data from the blockchain, which appeared to work okay. However, the individual did not provide any specific research suggestions or software recommendations at that time.</p>
