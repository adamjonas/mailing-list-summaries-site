    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Tim贸n on May 31, 2015, the topic of block size and its effect on mining and validation centralization was brought up. Tim贸n argued that larger blocks would lead to more centralization and put smaller miners out of business, while Andresen countered that if a miner is leaving potential earnings on the table due to poor connectivity, they should invest in better connectivity rather than blame centralization. The conversation then shifted to the minimum requirements for connectivity to run a full node, with Andresen suggesting that the estimated cost of running a full node is not excessive and concrete minimum specs should be targeted. However, the question of what happens when the limit is hit and whether completely removing the consensus maximum blocksize is the only solution was raised, with Tim贸n expressing concern over kicking the can down the road.</p>
