    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Aaron Voisine, the co-founder and CEO of breadwallet.com has suggested an increase in block size as a safer alternative to dropping transactions in a way that is unpredictable to the sender. Voisine believes that increasing the block size, although drastic, is the more conservative choice, considering the $3 billion plus value at stake in the system. He suggests that a fork takes effect when a specific large supermajority of the previous 1000 blocks indicate they have upgraded. Meanwhile, Pieter Wuille has disagreed with Voisine's suggestion, stating that suggesting a hard fork is betting the survival of the entire ecosystem on the bet that everyone will agree with and upgrade to new suggested software before a flag date.</p>
