    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discussed modifications that need to be made for a document to be merged. The BIP being discussed is only meant to derive the type of scripts encountered while doing addmultisigaddress. More complicated scripts would require more metadata to be shared, but the only case described is when given public keys and the number of signatures required. The email thread discusses the possibility of enforcing a convention for people to follow regarding canonical ordering of pubkeys executed by all CHECKMULTISIG opcodes. However, this convention should not be brought into validation rules, just a convention for people to follow for now. It is suggested that there is good reason for wallets to opt in to the convention and declare this, for ease of recovery and for interoperability reasons.</p>
