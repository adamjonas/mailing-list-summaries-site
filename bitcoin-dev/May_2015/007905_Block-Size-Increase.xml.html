    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen is calling for a consensus on the issue of Bitcoin block size limit, which is currently set at 1MB. He has proposed a one-time increase scheduled for early next year as a reasonable compromise and asked for objections to be raised to find a concrete course of action that everyone can agree upon. He is considering contributing some version of the bigger blocksize-limit hard-fork patch to the Bitcoin-Xt fork and then encouraging merchants, exchanges, web wallets and individuals who think it strikes a reasonable balance to run it. Ultimately, consensus comes down to what software people choose to run, and he hopes to find a compromise that entrepreneurs can use as a guideline. The hard question is what process do we use to decide tradeoffs and come to consensus?</p>
