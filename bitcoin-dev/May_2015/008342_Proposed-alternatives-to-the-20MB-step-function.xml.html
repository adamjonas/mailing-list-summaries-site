    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In May 2015, Gavin Andresen proposed a plan to get miners to agree on bigger blocks in the blockchain. He suggested using the soft-fork block version voting mechanism to get a majority and then a super-majority willing to produce bigger blocks. If the "bigger blocks now" movement is successful, he would ask for help getting big miners to do the same. The purpose of this process was to prove to doubters that they'd better start supporting bigger blocks or they'll be left behind. The ultimate authority for determining consensus is the code the majority of merchants, exchanges, and miners are running. However, it was not clear how exchange/merchant acceptance would be measured.</p>
