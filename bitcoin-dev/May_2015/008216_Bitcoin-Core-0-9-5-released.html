    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.5 has been released with the goal of backporting BIP66. The release includes few bug fixes and updated translations. Bitcoin Core's block templates are now for version 3 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either version 0.4.2 or any version from 0.5.1 onward. If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Bitcoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status. If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol, it will not affect you. If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool, it will affect you at the pool operator's discretion, which must be no later than BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status. The release also includes some notable changes to mining and relay policy enhancements. Upgrading to this release is recommended. Users can report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub. To upgrade to this version, users running an older version should shut it down and wait until it has completely shut down before running the installer (on Windows) or just copying over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). The 0.9.5 changelog describes the changes made in this release, including check pindexBestForkBase for null, fix priority calculation in CreateTransaction, sanitize command strings before logging them, raise version of created blocks, and enforce DERSIG in mempool, backport of some of BIP66's tests, implement BIP 66 validation rules and switchover logic, and build: fix dynamic boost check when --with-boost= is used. Credits are given to those who contributed to this release, including 21E14, Alex Morcos, Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, and Wladimir J. van der Laan, as well as everyone that helped translating on Transifex.</p>
