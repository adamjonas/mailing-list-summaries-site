    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik responded to Adam Weiss's email regarding proposed additional options for pruned nodes in Bitcoin development. Garzik suggested forwarding his response to the list as an FYI. In another part of the email thread, Weiss informed Garzik that his email to Bitcoin-dev was still generating Google spam warnings. Garzik responded by stating that it was San Francisco (SF), not Bitpay, that was rewriting email headers and breaking authentication, a problem that had been reported by 12 people. The email thread includes an HTML attachment that was scrubbed of its URL.</p>
