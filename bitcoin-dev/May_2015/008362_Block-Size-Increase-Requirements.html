    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Chun Wang from F2Pool, Chun Wang expressed concern about the possibility of bad miners attacking the network with artificial big blocks. However, after running simulations, Andresen found that there was no network topology where a big miner producing big blocks would cause a loss of profit to another miner producing smaller blocks. In response, F2Pool suggested that the max block size should be increased smoothly, starting with 2 MB first, and then after one or two years, 4 MB, 8 MB, and so on. Andresen questioned their choice of 2 MB and asked about the difference in bandwidth costs between 2MB blocks and 20MB blocks, given that server bandwidth is more expensive in China.</p>
