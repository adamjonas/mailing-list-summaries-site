    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The speaker expresses their opposition to a hard fork, rather than a block size increase, due to concerns about the potential for various parties to insert their own features into Bitcoin during such an update. They believe that a rush of lightly considered, obscure feature additions during a hard fork would be extremely risky for Bitcoin. However, if it could be guaranteed that raising the block size limit would be the only incompatible change introduced in the hard fork, they would support it. The speaker strongly fears that the hard fork itself will become an excuse to change other aspects of the system in unintended and possibly disastrous ways.</p>
