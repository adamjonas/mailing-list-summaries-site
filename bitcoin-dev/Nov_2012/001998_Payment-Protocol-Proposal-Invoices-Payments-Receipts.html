    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin transactions has shifted from developers to lawyers. If a merchant or payment processor is willing to take the risk of zero or low confirmation transactions and is insured against it, they can reply "accepted" immediately, which becomes a permanent proof of payment even if the Bitcoin transaction backing it gets reverted. However, a signed receipt is legally not worth anything, so there is no point in supporting it. For merchants selling physical goods, waiting for N confirmations is usually sufficient, and for those selling digital goods, access can be revoked once a failed transaction is discovered. Therefore, there is currently no advantageous use case for a Signed Receipt in its proposed form.</p>
