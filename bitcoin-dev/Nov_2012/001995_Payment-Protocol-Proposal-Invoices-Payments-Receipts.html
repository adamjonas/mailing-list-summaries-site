    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Michael Gronager and an unknown recipient, Gronager addresses a potential issue with confusing terminology in the context of a SignedReceipt not being received despite a transaction being posted on the P2P network. Gronager believes that the problem lies with the original definition of a receipt as something generated solely by the buyer. He suggests that the signed invoice message, Bitcoin transactions paying to the outputs, and merkle branches showing acceptance by the network constitute the actual receipt. The SignedReceipt message, while useful for merchant confirmation, is not necessary for proof of payment. Gronager proposes renaming the SignedReceipt to Acceptance or something similar, and clarifying that a signed invoice plus accepted Bitcoin transactions serves as mathematical proof of purchase.</p>
