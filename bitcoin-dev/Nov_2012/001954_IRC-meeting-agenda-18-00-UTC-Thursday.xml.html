    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the success of BIP, Luke-Jr emphasized the importance of encouraging wider community participation. However, Slush argued that it's not just about the BIP process, but also the content of proposals. He pointed out that he had promised to write a BIP draft for Stratum and implemented get_transactions method to allow Stratum jobs inspection. In response, Luke explained that the BIP process involves more than just writing a document; it also requires peer review and changes to meet the community's needs. The failure of key members of the community to participate in the GBT BIP process was identified as an issue that needs to be addressed to improve the process. While get_transactions is a step in the right direction, it may take time for Stratum to reach the same level as GBT. Luke's comments were not intended to bash Stratum or complain about the past, but to learn from it and figure out how to improve things for the future.</p>
