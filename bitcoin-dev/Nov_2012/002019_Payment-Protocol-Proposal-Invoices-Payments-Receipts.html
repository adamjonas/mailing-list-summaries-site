    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that adding more information to a spend sign could help solve many of the issues associated with transactions. This would involve including a transaction ID provided by the merchant, which would provide additional context and clarity. This proposal is seen as being much less complex than other solutions and could have significant benefits for all parties involved in transactions.</p>
