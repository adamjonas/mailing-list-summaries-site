    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 24, 2012, Mike Hearn proposed a draft BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) describing the bloom filtering protocol extension he developed with Matt. The proposal is available on the Bitcoin wiki. In response to the proposal, Pieter Wuille made two comments. First, he questioned the seed value used in the protocol and suggested using simpler values for k1 and k2. Second, he expressed unease about the filter parameters used for the implicitly created filter when sending filteradd without filterload, suggesting that it should always require an active filter to prevent DoS attacks. There was some consensus about this second point, with the general agreement that filteradd should not be used at all. Wuille also suggested making the actual filter data in filterload optional, with the assumption that it would be all zeroes if omitted, but this idea was met with skepticism. Hearn noted that sending a filter just to use filteradd to add things manually to the filter is a bad practice, and there is little benefit to implementing compressed bloom filter encoding for small filter loads.</p>
