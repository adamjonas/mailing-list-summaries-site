    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on November 26, 2012, Mike Hearn raised the issue of consistency for sellers in regard to Bitcoin transactions. He stated that it is important for sellers to be able to predict which Certificate Authorities (CAs) users have, otherwise their invoices would appear as unverified and could be subject to manipulation by viruses or even users who do not trust certain CAs. However, he believed that using the OS cert store could be too restrictive for merchants as it would limit them to what ships in all the operating systems their users use. Moreover, he argued that every browser has its own cert store for this reason. Finally, he stated that browsers with this bug are not relevant in his opinion.</p>
