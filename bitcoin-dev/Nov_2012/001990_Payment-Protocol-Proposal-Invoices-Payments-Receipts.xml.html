    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a proposal to create a "finance" working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been informed that such a move would be impossible. The individual was told by someone with previous experience at the IETF, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), that their drafts had expired and there was no support for such a group. Instead, the author is seeking to establish a top-level IANA registry group, which they believe is unlikely to face opposition. The author also says that they are currently working with IETF staff and have offers of support from several commercial entities to transition their proposals through to IANA management.</p>
