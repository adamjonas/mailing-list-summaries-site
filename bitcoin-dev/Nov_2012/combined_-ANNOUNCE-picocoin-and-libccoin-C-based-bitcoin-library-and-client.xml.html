        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new bitcoin implementation called "picocoin" has been announced. It includes a bitcoin library, "libccoin," which supports all key network datastructures, script parsing and validation, transaction and block validation, and many other features essential to any bitcoin client. Picocoin is a low resource, command line/JSON-driven bitcoin wallet with advanced security features such as required wallet encryption and fork-based process separation of P2P networking and wallet. The feature list includes support for multiple block chains, bloom filtering, and improved security.Mike Hearn responded to a message regarding the compatibility of libccoin and picocoin on Windows. He noted that both should work on the platform, but picocoin may be less secure due to the lack of fork. However, he suggested that Windows has good sandboxing support and that Win32 could potentially be implemented later for the same purpose. The email included a link to Go Parallel, a resource for staying up-to-date on parallel hardware and programming. The signature at the bottom of the email was from Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab.Code contributions, comments, and donations are welcome for picocoin.</p>
