    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), Mike Hearn questions the need for a process to allocate numbers and suggests removing the part of the BIP template that requires it. He also questions the need for an editing role. While there have been some issues with collisions and nonsensical proposals in the past, there is little attractiveness to writing BIPs as many do not result in useful discussion. However, Pieter expresses his desire to see more non-core proposals related to Bitcoin being discussed. Regarding the feature freeze of 0.8, both Mike and Pieter agree that more time is needed to get the bloom filtering work in. They believe that promoting the 0.8 release as an important scalability/performance improvement for the network will be easier once the bloom filtering work is complete. Ultraprune and bloom filtering are considered the two major scalability improvements available at the moment. There are still some TODOs left for ultraprune, including auto-migrating old data and UTXO set consistency checks at startup.</p>
