    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 8th, 2012, Mike Hearn sent a message suggesting that it might be time to feature-freeze 0.8. He expressed his desire to have more time to implement the bloom filtering work in order to promote the release as an "important scalability/performance improvement for the network." Another developer agreed with the sentiment but noted that ultraprune (another major change) would speak for itself and expressed concern about overselling the update to miners and merchants.However, there were concerns that freezing RPC and GUI changes might lead to delays on QA for those updates. Therefore, it was suggested that discussions should take place to determine what needed to be done to get the current version ready for release.</p>
