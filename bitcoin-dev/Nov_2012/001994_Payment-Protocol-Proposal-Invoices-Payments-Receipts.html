    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the possibility of a scenario where the SignedReceipt is not received, but the transaction is posted on the p2p network. The suggestion put forward is to sign the invoice with the key to which the payment is sent, so that the proof of payment is recorded in the blockchain, thus eliminating the risk of a limbo situation without a SignedReceipt. The proposal has several advantages, such as allowing any user to send signed invoices, regardless of whether they have an x509 certificate. However, it does disable the use of anything but payment to key/address, including multi-signature. The majority of use cases would still involve payment to key/address. To support general pay to script, the proposed payment scheme by Mike can be used, whereby no non-fee payments are accepted except in a group. This way, the merchant can generate the final transaction, including the fees, and that one could be to a general script. This keeps the support for pay to general script needed for a client to a minimum.</p>
