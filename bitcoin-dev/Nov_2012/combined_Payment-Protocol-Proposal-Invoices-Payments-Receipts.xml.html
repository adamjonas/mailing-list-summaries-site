        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion between Michael Gronager and Gavin Andresen is about the usefulness of the SignedReceipt message in confirming a purchase, where Michael thinks that it's unnecessary because email receipts are already used. On the other hand, Gavin's proposal is to couple the receipt with the acceptance of Bitcoin transactions. Pieter's original proposal was to avoid uncertainty involved in Bitcoin transaction, and his proposal allowed a merchant/payment processor to reply "accepted" even if the actual Bitcoin transaction that backs it gets reverted. The receiver could retry until the receipt says "accepted" or "rejected". Luke-Jr discussed on how cert system provides value and how non-acceptance looks like malice. He suggested having a static whitelist plus an OS provided list minus a user configured blacklist; this way, people can trust that if their cert is signed via one on the whitelist, they'll work for ALL normal users. Mike Hearn talked about network speed post-inflation and how people may choose not to broadcast transactions at all in some cases. Walter Stanish mentioned an X-ISO4217-A3 draft that is not standards track and doesn't address any of the targeted items.</p>
