    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The IFEX protocol is presented as a mechanism for the identification, negotiation, description, execution and management of financial transactions over their lifetime. The protocol has opened the door to the potential for faster progress on the IFEX protocol itself, which is kind of the same zone of potential functionality that people are talking about here. Recognizing that Bitcoin is not the only emerging financial community or settlement system facing real-world business integration challenges. Instead of investing valuable developer time on internal implementation of a tightly-scoped (crippled?) business-level protocol extension to Bitcoin, interested parties instead contribute to projects like IFEX that view systems such as Bitcoin as core use cases but are not limited by Bitcoin developer time or project trajectory, and promise re-usability for other conventional, emerging and future currencies/commodities/settlement systems.</p>
