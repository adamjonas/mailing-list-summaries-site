    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The draft-stanish-x-iso4217-a3 proposal is not standards track due to the bureaucracy involved in the Standards Track process. Instead, the proposal will be transitioned through to IANA management using the Independent Stream Editor path and will then be converted to Informational status. The proposal is an IANA registry proposal and there are currently three published proposals. The author is working with IETF staff and commercial bodies to transition the proposals through to IANA management. The proposal does not address the targeted items discussed in a previous post, such as the Internet Financial Exchange (IFEX) proposal that facilitates the negotiation of financial transactions between internet-based financial endpoints. Discussions have occurred regarding the IFEX-based paradigm for settlement versus other proposed paradigms, such as Ripple. The author hopes to combine efforts to create a joint proposal that can benefit other currencies/commodities and settlement systems as well as Bitcoin.</p>
