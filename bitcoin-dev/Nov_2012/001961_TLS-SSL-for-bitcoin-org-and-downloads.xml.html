    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), has become an important security measure for websites and downloads. Jay recently inquired about the possibility of enforcing TLS for bitcoin.org and its downloads. The site currently supports both HTTP and HTTPS, but there are no current plans to force TLS. However, the site does encourage the use of HTTPS and offers a guide on how to download Bitcoin Core securely through HTTPS. Additionally, Bitcoin Core releases are signed with PGP keys to ensure authenticity. Users should always verify signatures before downloading any software from the internet. Overall, while there are no immediate plans to force TLS for bitcoin.org and its downloads, the website does prioritize security measures such as HTTPS and PGP key verification. Users should remain vigilant and take necessary precautions when downloading software from any source.</p>
