    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Steve, a member of the Bitcoin Dev Kit project, responded to Humberto's announcement of a new open-source Bitcoin library written in Java. Steve suggested that Humberto take a look at their project on GitHub, which is building support for Kotlin/Java and eventually Swift and iOS. He also mentioned that joining their team would be a great way to learn about the primitives for on-chain Bitcoin. Humberto's library was created for educational purposes and does not include features that allow communication with nodes nor any online features. It is intended for developers who want to build a wallet in Java. Feedback, PRs, and issues are welcome and appreciated. The website for the project is <a href="https://www.bitcoineducation.site/">https://www.bitcoineducation.site/</a>.</p>
