    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Michael and Prayank discuss the issue of miner signaling in relation to soft forks. Prayank emphasizes that miner signaling is not a form of voting for or expressing support for a soft fork, but simply a tool for signaling readiness. He notes that there needs to be sufficient community consensus before facilitating miner signaling to avoid misinterpretation by users. During the signaling process for taproot, many users across different communities believed that miners were voting for taproot, leading to confusion and misinformation. Prayank shared a link to clarify the issue, but acknowledges that there are still people who think miners vote during signaling. The opinions of some developers on MASF vs UASF also add to the confusion surrounding this topic. Prayank expresses his concern about finding a solution to this problem.</p>
