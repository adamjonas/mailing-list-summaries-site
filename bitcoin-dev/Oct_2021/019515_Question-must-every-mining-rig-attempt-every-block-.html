    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion to conserve energy in the Bitcoin mining process has been proposed. This involves incorporating a non-gameable attribute into each mining rig which would be used to determine if a block will be accepted by that particular rig. The idea is to create a green light/red light system where a block must meet all the requirements of a successful block and also come from a rig with a green light to be accepted by the network. It is suggested that the bitcoin network ID could be used as the non-gameable attribute. To implement this, data from the last successful block along with the miner's attribute could be hashed and if it falls below a certain number set by an algorithm, the miner gets a green light to produce a valid block. The author of this proposal is Nathan Alexander from Arlington, TX.</p>
