    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post is about a proposed scheme to improve security in the development of bitcoin. The author suggests using a sortition system, which would encourage more developers to participate without harming their reputation, while also ensuring they are always on their toes. The scheme would include public precommitments collected at ceremonial intervals, with hash1 being a sortition ticket and hash2 being a public precommitment. The random oracle could be block hashes, and a red-team-concurrency difficulty parameter could control how many least-significant bits must match to be secretly selected. Upon assignment, the developer would have community approval to opportunistically insert a security flaw, which they would reveal along with the sortition ticket that hashes to their public precommitment when either caught, merged or on timeout. Sortition Precommitment Day might be once or twice a year.</p>
