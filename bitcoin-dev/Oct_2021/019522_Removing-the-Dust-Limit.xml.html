    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is pondering the possibility of a "lightweight" node that would ignore UTXOs below the dust limit, wouldn't validate dust transactions and would still validate POW and other transactions. Such nodes could potentially get forked by accepting valid mined blocks with an invalid but ignored dust transaction. However, this attack seems to be as expensive as a 51% attack. The author's question is how such a node would treat a transaction that spends multiple dust UTXOs and creates a single non-dust UTXO out of them after fees. The author presumes that the node never stores dust UTXOs and therefore cannot determine whether the UTXO being spent by such a transaction is spending dust, trying to spend an already-spent TXO or inventing a TXO out of /dev/random.</p>
