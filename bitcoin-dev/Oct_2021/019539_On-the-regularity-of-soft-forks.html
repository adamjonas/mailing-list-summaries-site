    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised concerns about the confusion surrounding miner signaling during soft fork activation. While miner signaling is merely a tool for signaling readiness and does not represent a voting process, many users and even developers have misunderstood its purpose. During the signaling for taproot, some believed that miners were actually voting for it, leading to the need for more education on the topic. The issue of who gets to decide for users during bip8 activation has also caused controversy, with some believing that miners should decide for users instead of developers. These misunderstandings are likely to continue in future soft fork activations, leaving many users confused.</p>
