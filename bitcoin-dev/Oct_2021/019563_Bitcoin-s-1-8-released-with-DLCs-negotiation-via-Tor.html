    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-s team has released version 1.8 of their software, which now supports the opening of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) over Tor. The new feature is meant to simplify the process of entering into a DLC with a counterparty. The release also includes two detailed examples of entering into a wallet election and wallet price using oracles. These examples are intended to complement the existing election and price oracle examples. However, the software is still in alpha stage, so users are cautioned not to use it for large amounts of money. The artifacts can be found at the bottom of the release notes on Github, but users must have a Github account to access them. Additionally, a demonstration video for using the wallet to enter into a DLC over Tor is available on YouTube. Finally, the DLC specification can be found on the discreetlogcontracts Github page.</p>
