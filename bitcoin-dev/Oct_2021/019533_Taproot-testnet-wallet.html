    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas Schildbach via bitcoin-dev is trying to finish off bitcoinj's implementation for sending to taproot addresses. He is requesting a testnet wallet that can receive to P2TR and spend back in order to complete this task. Andreas has been trying to get a taproot address from Bitcoin Core 22.0 but has been unsuccessful after many hours of trying. Pieter has responded to Andreas' request by providing instructions on how to construct a taproot-capable wallet in Bitcoin Core. This involves having or creating a descriptor wallet with descriptors=true, importing a taproot descriptor (of the form "tr(KEY)") as active descriptor with active=true, where KEY can be a tprv.../* or any other supported key expression, and getting a new address with addresstype=bech32m. Pieter has also provided a taproot address for testing purposes: tb1p84x2ryuyfevgnlpnxt9f39gm7r68gwtvllxqe5w2n5ru00s9aquslzggwq. If testnet coins are sent there, Pieter has requested an email address to return them.</p>
