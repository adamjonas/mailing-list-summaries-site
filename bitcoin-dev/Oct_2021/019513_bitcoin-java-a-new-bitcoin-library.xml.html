    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Humberto, the owner of the repository <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java,">https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java,</a> has announced the development of a new open-source Bitcoin library written in Java, which supports taproot single key transactions. The primary motivation behind building this library was for educational purposes, as Humberto believes that it is ideal for developers who want to build a wallet in Java. He also mentioned that he was missing a lean bitcoin library written in Java, as he thought that bitcoinj is too feature-heavy and does not intend to include features that allow communication with nodes or any online features in it.Developers are welcome to provide feedback, PRs, and issues on the project's website, where Humberto plans to post more examples using it: <a href="https://www.bitcoineducation.site/">https://www.bitcoineducation.site/</a>.</p>
