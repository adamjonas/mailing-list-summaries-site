        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation is about conserving energy in Bitcoin mining. Nathan Alexander from Arlington, TX has proposed a solution involving incorporating a non-gameable attribute into each mining rig to determine if a block will be accepted. Ruben suggested that such discussions have taken place before and directed Nathan to related threads on Bitcoin-dev and Bitcoin Stack Exchange. However, it was pointed out that miners can still game the system by grinding on which of their multiple addresses gets the green light. Identifying miners reduces anonymity and is not feasible in decentralized adversarial environments. The power consumption in proof-of-work is an important security parameter against state co-option, making it economically infeasible for states to 51% Bitcoin. Proof of stake systems aim to create non-gameable attributes using red light-green light mechanisms but are not very effective as their security mostly relies on the weakest piece of the hybrid system. The idea of "green mining" is unlikely to be seriously considered for Bitcoin.</p>
