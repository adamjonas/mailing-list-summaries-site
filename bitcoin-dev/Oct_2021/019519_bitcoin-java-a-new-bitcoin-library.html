    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Humberto Marcolino, the owner of the repository <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java,">https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java,</a> has developed a new open-source Bitcoin library written in Java with support for taproot single key transactions. The main motivation behind building this library was for educational purposes and to provide a leaner alternative to bitcoinj, which is too feature-heavy. The library does not include features that allow communication with nodes or any online features, making it ideal for developers who want to build a wallet in Java. Feedback, PRs, and issues are welcome and appreciated. Humberto has also created a discord server for the project where developers can collaborate. He plans to post more examples using the library on the project's website, <a href="https://www.bitcoineducation.site/">https://www.bitcoineducation.site/</a>. Mohamed Youssef, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, expressed interest in the library and asked if there were plans for a slack or IRC for collaboration.</p>
