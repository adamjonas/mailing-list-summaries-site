    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dustin enquired about a proposal from roastbeef to introduce a new P2P message that would retrieve all prev-outputs for a given block and verify the scripts against the block by executing them. While this would permit some forms of input script malleability, it would restrict what an attacker could do. Dustin was looking for any follow up on this proposal but could not find any references under another name such as thread, PR or BIP. In another post to the same mailing list, Tamas Blummer suggested a change to BIP158 that would allow the decision on which filter chain is correct at lower bandwidth use. The current BIP does not provide tools for checking input scripts, which are in some blocks before the downloaded block. A remedy here would be another filter chain on created and spent outpoints. However, this method would be highly ineffective, and a better solution would be a change to BIP158 such that the only filter contains created scripts and spent outpoints.</p>
