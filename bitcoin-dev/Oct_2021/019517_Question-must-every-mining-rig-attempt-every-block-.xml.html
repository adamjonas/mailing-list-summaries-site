    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In response to Nathan's question about conserving energy in Bitcoin mining, Ruben suggests that there have been previous discussions on "green mining" and directs him to a thread on Bitcoin-dev from May 2021. He also provides a link to Bitcoin Stack Exchange where Nathan may find related answers. Ruben notes that these types of discussions are unlikely to result in serious consideration for Bitcoin. Nathan's proposal involves using a non-gameable attribute of each mining rig to calculate whether a block would be accepted by that rig, potentially reducing energy consumption. He suggests that the bitcoin network ID could be used as this attribute, creating a green light/red light system. Ruben does not provide further comment on Nathan's proposal.</p>
