        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On October 25th, 2021, Lisa Neigut proposed an idea to bitcoin-dev that the mempool should be eliminated. However, Pieter Wuille disagreed with this proposal and argued that it would make it harder for anyone to become a miner and would incentivize wallets to submit to the largest few pools, causing centralization. He also explained that removing the mempool would not greatly reduce the bandwidth requirement for running a node due to compact blocks and Erlay. Additionally, removing the mempool would replace socialized transparency with a few who get to see the actual details, which is not ideal. Pieter provided alternative solutions such as weak blocks and expressed his concerns about the proposal's impact on the full node network's responsibility to relay blocks between miners quickly. On a different note, ZmnSCPxj suggested a "nursery GC" variation in response to spam, which would be similar to the pre-mempool/memswamp proposals.</p>
