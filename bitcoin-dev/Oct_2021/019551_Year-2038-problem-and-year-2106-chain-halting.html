    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Good morning yanmaani,It has been discussed that it is not possible to achieve a certain goal by softfork. However, there is still a belief that it can be done if they try hard enough. In order to achieve this goal, there are certain rules to follow. Firstly, the block timestamp may not be lower than the median of the last 11 blocks. Secondly, the block timestamp may not be greater than the current time plus two hours. Lastly, the block timestamp may not be greater than 2^32 (Sun, 07 Feb 2106 06:28:16 +0000).A question was raised regarding what happens if a series of blocks has a timestamp of 0xFFFFFFFF at the appropriate time. It was explained that in this case, rule number one is not violated since "not lower than" means "greater than or equal to", and after a while the median becomes 0xFFFFFFFF and 0xFFFFFFFF == 0xFFFFFFFF. Rule number two is also not violated as it would be a past actual real time. Similarly, rule number three is also not violated since 0xFFFFFFFF is less than 2^32.Overall, it is important to follow these rules in order to achieve the desired outcome through softfork.</p>
