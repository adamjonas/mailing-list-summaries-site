        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj argues that requiring an on-chain transaction to update the set of channels created by a factory defeats the purpose of having a factory. He explains that factories can be created today without even using Taproot, by simply creating an n-of-n output for the funding transaction and then splitting it through an off-chain transaction. To change the set of channels, participants create and sign an alternate transaction that spends the original output to a new n-of-n with the same participants. They then sign and broadcast this transaction to update the set of channels. This process works today without changes to Bitcoin or Taproot.John responded to an email from Anthony Towns thanking him for reviewing his paper on Inherited IDs (IIDs) and addressing some misunderstandings in the paper. He clarified that despite the use of an operator in certain protocols, they are still trust-free since the operator cannot take funds or prevent others from obtaining what is due to them. Additionally, IIDs cannot be simulated with anyprevout because it lacks a mechanism for creating covenants and would not unconditionally transfer ownership. The core functionality of IIDs enables "update-forest" and "challenge-and-response" to allow transferring ownership of channels in a trust-free manner with a single transaction. John's paper shows that IIDs can eliminate watchtowers, create factories with unbounded parties/channels, and achieve these results by using a safer change to Bitcoin than the support for floating transactions.</p>
