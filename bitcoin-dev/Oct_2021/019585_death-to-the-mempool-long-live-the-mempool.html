    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been put forward to eliminate the mempool, with users submitting transactions directly to mining pools instead. The argument is that mempools are unnecessary in a world where mining is done by a semi-restricted set of participants and removing the mempool would greatly reduce the bandwidth requirement for running a node. However, others have pointed out that this proposal presents issues such as complicating solo mining and making BetterHash proposals more difficult. It also deviates from the security model of Bitcoin and makes explicit the target for DoS attacks. Proponents argue that direct communication between block template construction venues and transaction proposers could provide a venue for direct feedback regarding acceptable feerates at the time, which both makes transaction confirmation timelines less variable and provides block producers a mechanism for enforcing their own minimum security budget. Critics suggest that communicating two numbers can easily be done over HTTP and already exists.</p>
