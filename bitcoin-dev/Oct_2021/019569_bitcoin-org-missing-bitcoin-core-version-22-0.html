    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The GPG signature verification for Bitcoin Core version 22 and later has changed. There are two main changes to the verification process. First, the sha256 checksums are now in a separate file from the GPG signatures. Users need to download a new file named "SHA256SUMS" which contains the checksums and also the "SHA256SUMS.asc" that contains the signatures. Second, the signature file now contains multiple signatures generated by multiple builders who have provided their own public keys to verify against. Instructions on where to find and how to import the full list of builder public keys can be found in the bitcoin core GitHub repo.A user expressed concern about the changes, noting that Wladimir is no longer signing the releases and expressing distrust in their GPG network. The list of builder public keys includes many long-time bitcoin core contributors as well as Wladimir's. Caution is always warranted but unnecessary fear, uncertainty, and doubt should not be spread.Users can find more information about these changes at bitcoincore.org/en/download/ under the "Linux verification instructions" section. It is important to note that there is only one website which represents Bitcoin Core full node implementation, and it can be downloaded from <a href="https://bitcoincore.org">https://bitcoincore.org</a>.</p>
