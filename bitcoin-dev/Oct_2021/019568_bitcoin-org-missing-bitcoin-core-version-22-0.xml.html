    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 20th, 2021, Owen Gunden expressed his concern that Wladimir is no longer signing the releases and he has no trust in the gpg network of the people who seem to have replaced him. However, Pieter clarified that this is not correct and shared the attestations on the 22.0 release by Wladimir. There is no separate special release key anymore, instead, the build attestations can be used as a trust basis.Owen also raised concerns about a combination of items changing, including a new website and new gpg signers at the same time, given the level of security at stake. Pieter clarified that there is no new website and the Bitcoin Core project website has been <a href="https://bitcoincore.org">https://bitcoincore.org</a> for years. The lack of update on <a href="https://bitcoin.org">https://bitcoin.org</a> to list the 22.0 release is up to them.</p>
