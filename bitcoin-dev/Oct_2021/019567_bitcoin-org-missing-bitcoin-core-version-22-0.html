    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, developer Owen Gunden expressed concern about recent changes to the Bitcoin Core project's website and release signing process. Specifically, Gunden noted that Wladimir van der Laan, the lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, had stopped signing releases as of version 22.0, and that Gunden did not trust the people who had replaced him. However, other developers pointed out that the releases were still signed with van der Laan's personal key, as well as the keys of several other developers.Gunden also expressed concern about the timing of these changes, which coincided with a new version of the Bitcoin Core website. However, it was noted that bitcoincore.org has been the official website for Bitcoin Core for several years, and that binaries have not been posted to bitcoin.org by the release maintainer for several major releases. The only reason they are still available there is because bitcoin.org's maintainer mirrors them.Overall, while Gunden's concerns highlight the importance of security in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it appears that the changes to the website and signing process are part of long-standing practices within the Bitcoin Core community.</p>
