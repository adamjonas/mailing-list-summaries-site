        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-s team has released version 1.8 of their software, which now supports the opening of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) over Tor. This new feature is intended to simplify the process of entering into a DLC with a counterparty. The release also includes two detailed examples of entering into a wallet election and wallet price using oracles. These examples are meant to complement the existing election and price oracle examples. However, users are cautioned not to use the software for large amounts of money since it is still in alpha stage.Users can find the artifacts at the bottom of the release notes on Github, but they must have a Github account to access them. In addition, there is a demonstration video on YouTube that explains how to use the wallet to enter into a DLC over Tor. Finally, the DLC specification can be found on the discreetlogcontracts Github page.</p>
