    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd has declared himself and all technology companies he controls as "Defensive" by committing to offer a Defensive Patent License, version 1.1, for any of his patents either existing or future, to any DPL User. He clarifies that neither he nor any companies he controls have any patents at this time. The language "all technology companies I control" is there to avoid any complications with non-technology companies that he may control in the future, e.g. family real-estate holding companies, and the non-profit caving group he's a part of. Peter Todd mentions that he only controls one company as of writing, the numbered company he does all his consulting through, which he considers a "technology company", and thus the above offer applies to it. Equally, if he ends up in control of any other technology companies, then the above offer will apply. Peter Todd can be contacted through his address pete at petertodd.org.</p>
