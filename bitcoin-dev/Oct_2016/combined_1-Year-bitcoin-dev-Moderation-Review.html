        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin, has raised concerns about the moderation policy and its impact on the community. According to Rubin, since the implementation of moderation, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of messages posted daily, making the community less accessible. He suggests that people may be self-censoring out of fear of being moderated as trolling or spam, which is reducing the value of the list. Henning Kopp agrees with Rubin's assessment and emphasizes the need to keep non-development talk off the developer list. This discussion highlights the importance of communication channels in the development process and how excessive moderation can hinder communication and the exchange of ideas within a community.Jeremy, a member of the Bitcoin development team, questions whether the moderation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is stifling discussion and diminishing the list's value. While recognizing the potential benefits of moderation, he argues that it may have gone too far, discouraging people from writing emails due to the fear of being moderated. Jeremy believes that the rate of moderated posts does not accurately reflect the "chilling effect" of moderation, which reduces email activity and limits valuable communication within the community. He suggests that the community should collectively address this issue in order to restore open communication.Another member of the community, Henning Kopp, agrees that non-development talk should be kept off the bitcoin-dev mailing list but proposes finding a way to revitalize the bitcoin-discuss list, which has not gained enough contributors. The suggestion is made that bitcoin-discuss should have an opt-out system instead of opt-in, raising questions about the subscription counts for both bitcoin-dev and bitcoin-discuss. The author of the message requests this information from the moderators, although their specific reason for wanting it is unclear. The choice between an opt-in and opt-out system can impact the number of subscribers to a group or mailing list.In summary, Jeremy Rubin initiates a discussion on the impact of moderation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressing concerns about decreased email activity and self-censorship. He suggests reopening the communication channel while acknowledging the need to keep non-development talk separate. The suggestion of an opt-out system for the bitcoin-discuss list is also raised, raising questions about subscription counts for both lists. Overall, this discussion highlights the importance of effective communication channels and the potential consequences of excessive moderation within a community.</p>
