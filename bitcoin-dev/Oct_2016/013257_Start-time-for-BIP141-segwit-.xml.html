    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list on October 17, 2016, Tom Zander warned against creating "everyone-can-spend" transactions in anticipation of a softfork. He argued that doing so would result in a loss of funds for those who used them if a major flaw was discovered and a rollback was necessary. Zander clarified that nobody was asking for this and advised against producing segwit transactions until after the softfork was activated. Once activated, these transactions would no longer be anyone-can-spend. He emphasized that nobody would be forced to use the new format immediately after activation and that some may choose to upgrade later for various reasons, such as caution or not yet implementing the new features. It was noted that this change was backward compatible.</p>
