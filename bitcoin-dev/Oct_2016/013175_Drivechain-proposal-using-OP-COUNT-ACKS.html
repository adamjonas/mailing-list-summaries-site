    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sergio Demian Lerner via bitcoin-dev expressed his doubts over any proposals from an individual or colleagues who have a history of patenting Bitcoin consensus relevant technology, which he believes to be a serious threat to decentralization. He suggested that the dangerous and unethical behavior needs to be rectified in a convincing, legally binding way and proposed looking into Blockstream's patent pledges for a way forward. Lerner NACKed the proposal on the basis of the history of patenting. The proposal was related to drivechains that RSK (a.k.a Rootstock) would like to use for its two-way pegged blockchain implementation. With ScalingBitcoin approaching, it was deemed a good time to publish the proposal on drivechains.</p>
