    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer thinks that Nov. 15 is a reasonable date for the release of SegWit, as the holidays coming up in the West may prevent people from working on it. He believes that if wallet developers are not updating their statuses, it's not the fault of the website and that 'WIP' can mean a lot of things. He has confidence that Armory will be ready soon, but other wallets may be stuck where they were in spring. At the Scaling Bitcoin wallet workshop last week, he noticed that wallet developers were more concerned about UI and HW wallet standards than their ability to support SegWit. The fact that there is a much safer alternative in the form of Flexible Transactions may mean that SegWit will not get activated, and we won't know until it's actually locked in. Nonetheless, most wallets will probably work just fine even if they don't support SegWit, and devs should use testnet or regtest to iron out their kinks before hitting mainnet. FlexTrans is off-topic, and others have suggested starting another thread to discuss it.</p>
