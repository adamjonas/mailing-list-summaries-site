    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, concerns were raised regarding the possibility of any encumbrances on a proposal that would preclude its use in the Bitcoin project. The concern stemmed from the fact that pending patents are not publicly visible, and the BIP process does not require patent disclosure. However, it was suggested that providing a voluntary disclosure of patents with a free license to such patents could be an alternative solution to resolve patent concerns if Rootstock is not prepared to adopt a defensive patent strategy in general. Another issue raised in the thread was related to the OP_COUNT_ACKS operation and how the values pushed onto the stack depend on the ack and nack counts relative to the block. Russell O'Connor expressed concern that this would result in transactions being invalid in subsequent blocks, which would break the monotonicity rule for transaction validity. While it's unclear if decentralised sidechains can be implemented without breaking this rule, Luke argued that it may be acceptable as the only way the transaction would become invalid is through the equivalent of a double-spend.</p>
