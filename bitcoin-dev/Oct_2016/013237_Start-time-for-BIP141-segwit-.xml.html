    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There have been objections to the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) for a while, and some wallets are taking a "wait and see" approach. The majority of wallets are not ready for it, according to the linked page. Wallets may not want to invest resources in adding support for a feature that may never be activated. Flexible Transactions is considered as a safer alternative to SegWit, but it will not be known which option will be activated until it is locked in. Even if all wallets support SegWit, they need to be rolled out and people need to download updates, which can take time. Two months after the lock-in of SegWit would be the minimum safe time for people to upgrade their wallets.</p>
