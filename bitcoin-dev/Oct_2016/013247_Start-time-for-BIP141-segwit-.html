    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list is centered around the controversial SegWit upgrade. One member argues that the lack of updated information from wallet developers is a worrying sign, while another member believes that the wallets will still function properly without supporting SegWit. The issue of FlexTrans being off-topic is also raised. However, the main point of contention is the safety of the proposed SegWit upgrade, which some members feel has not been given enough consideration. They argue that a longer fallow period would be a simple way to ensure safety and acknowledge the potential damage a controversial soft fork of this magnitude can have. Some members seem to dismiss these concerns and refuse to extend the safety period, leading to further disagreement among the group.</p>
