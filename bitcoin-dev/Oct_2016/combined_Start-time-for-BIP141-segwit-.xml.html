        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Core team is preparing to release version 0.13.1, which will include segregated witness for Bitcoin mainnet. The activation date of BIP 141, which includes segregated witness, has been proposed for November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC. However, Tom Zander expressed concern about the short grace period and suggested that SegWit needs to be deployed safely as it is a controversial soft-fork. He also noted that miners could be false-signalling and advised waiting at least a week to observe any sign of false signaling before using segwit extensively. Pieter Wuille proposed setting BIP 141's start time to November 15, 2016, 0:00 UTC based on the BIP9 recommendation to set the versionbits start time a month in advance. However, Tom Zander suggested a minimum of 2 months grace period for safety reasons even though it affects not only businesses but also end users. Zander believes that anyone who wants to be safe needs to upgrade their wallets. Regarding SPV wallets, businesses and individuals have stated that nobody said it would take more than two weeks to upgrade to a new release over the last year or two in response to Gavin Andresen's inquiry. However, Tom Zander pointed out that the question asked was likely about the block size, and since this upgrade affects end users too, he suggests a minimum of 2 months grace period. SPV wallets will work as normal without an upgrade, but full nodes will provide transactions to SPV in a format they understand. If users don't upgrade, it means the fee is too low for them to care, which is good news. Pre-activation consensus-imposed grace period could never replace post-activation self-imposed observation period.</p>
