    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Zander expressed concern over the proposed fallow period for the SegWit soft fork upgrade. He suggested that two months should be the minimum time frame for users to upgrade in order to ensure safety. However, Gavin Andresen countered this by stating that he had surveyed businesses and individuals, and found that no one said it would take them more than two weeks to upgrade. He also argued that those running their own validation code are likely sophisticated enough to mitigate any risks associated with SegWit activation on their own. The email thread included an HTML attachment which was not specified or described.</p>
