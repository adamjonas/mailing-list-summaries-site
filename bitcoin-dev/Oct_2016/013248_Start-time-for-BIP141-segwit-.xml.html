    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Zander expressed concern over the lack of updated statuses from wallet developers. He noted that only 20% of wallets have been deemed ready for SegWit, which is considered the most disruptive and invasive change ever made to Bitcoin. This has led to controversy among miners, some of whom have expressed their dislike for the upgrade, raising concerns about potential network splits. Despite this, many wallet developers are eagerly awaiting the release of SegWit, which they believe will increase security by reducing the complexity of hardware wallets. TREZOR, for example, has already completed the firmware for SegWit but has not yet finalized the stack due to uncertainty around an actual release date.</p>
