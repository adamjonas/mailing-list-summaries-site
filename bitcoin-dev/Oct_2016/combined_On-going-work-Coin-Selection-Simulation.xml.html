        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Murch has been working on his Master's thesis about Coin Selection and has re-implemented multiple coin selection strategies of prominent Bitcoin wallets. He created a framework to simulate wallet behavior and invited feedback from the community. In a previous email thread, Murch discussed his thesis and asked for comments. Murch also released an updated version of his Coin Selection Simulator on his GitHub repository. He encouraged users to report errors or ask questions about the simulator. The simulator analyzes different coin selection strategies used by popular Bitcoin wallets and provides insights into how they function. One of the findings of the simulation is that Mycelium selects UTXOs in a FIFO approach and prunes by removing the smallest selected UTXO until the excess beyond the spending target is minimized. This approach may be responsible for Mycelium's small UTXO build-up. Murch suggests a balanced approach between pruning and allowing small inputs to be selected to slowly drain low-value UTXOs out of the wallet over time.Murch also submitted a presentation proposal to Scaling Bitcoin and shared a PDF with the mailing list, which contains a description of his work and preliminary simulation results. The PDF shows three figures that depict the simulated wallets' UTXO compositions at the end of the simulation. Murch said that he can provide further information as requested and would welcome any feedback. In response to Murch's email, Daniel Weigl asked if Murch's simulation code was available somewhere and why Mycelium generated a very big UTXO set for 5460sat.</p>
