    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Zander was arguing that longer grace periods for upgrades would make the network safer. Andrew C asked how this would be so, noting that once a fork reaches LOCKED_IN status, it will become active after a period of time regardless. Zander responded by saying that companies would not roll out their updates until it locks in and that SegWit is much bigger than just full nodes (including miner). An entire ecosystem of Bitcoin will have a need to upgrade. Peter Todd chimed in stating his OpenTimestamps code does not fully understand transactions and relies on his full node to do that for him. His point being that SegWit is a backwards compatible soft-fork and the vast majority of code out there will not have to change.</p>
