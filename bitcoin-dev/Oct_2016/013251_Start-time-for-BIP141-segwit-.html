    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom Zander, a developer on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressed concern about the short activation time for SegWit, stating that it was controversial and required extra safety measures due to its soft-fork nature. He pointed out that if any issues occurred after deployment, all transactions made in the meantime would be turned into everyone-can-spent transactions, resulting in real people losing real money. To prevent this, he emphasized the importance of ensuring proper miner support before activation. However, he acknowledged that it was impossible to tell if some miners were false signaling until the rules were fully activated and suggested waiting at least a week to observe any signs of false signaling. He also cautioned against using SegWit extensively at the beginning if users were concerned about false signaling.</p>
