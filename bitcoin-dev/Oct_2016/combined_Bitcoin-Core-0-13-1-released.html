        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1 has been released with activation parameters for the segwit softfork, bugfixes, performance improvements and updated translations. However, Windows XP and OS X 10.7 are no longer supported from this version. Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that eliminates unwanted transaction malleability and increases capacity. Nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the first retarget period after segwit's start date of November 15, 2016. If 95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period signal support for segwit, the softfork will be locked in. The release includes low-level RPC changes, such as `importprunedfunds` only accepting two required arguments and ARM builds being experimental. Consensus changes include the implementation of NULLDUMMY softfork (BIP147), adding NULLDUMMY verify flag in bitcoinconsensus.h, and defining start and end time for segwit deployment. Block and transaction handling have experienced several changes and improvements, including reducing default number of blocks to check at startup, adding policy limits and disabling uncompressed keys for segwit scripts, making non-minimal OP_IF/NOTIF argument non-standard for P2WSH, and precomputing sighashes. The release also includes changes to P2P protocol and network code, build system, GUI, wallet, tests and QA, and documentation. The Bitcoin Core team has released the version 0.13.1 update of its software, which contains a range of improvements, bug fixes and security enhancements. The most notable changes are the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a new signature scheme that addresses transaction malleability, and other features including faster block validation times, fee estimation improvements and better privacy for lightweight wallets.</p>
