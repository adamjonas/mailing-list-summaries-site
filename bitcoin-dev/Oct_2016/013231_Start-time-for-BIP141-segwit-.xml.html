    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Zander suggested a minimum of two months as the fallow period for upgrading to a new release. He believed that anyone who wanted to be safe needs to upgrade, and that this upgrade would affect end users as well as businesses. Gavin Andresen replied that he had asked many businesses and individuals how long it would take them to upgrade to a new release over the last year or two, and nobody said it would take them more than two weeks. However, the question Andresen asked was likely about the block size, whereas the upgrade in question affects not only businesses but also end users. Zander even believed that two months is too fast, considering the magnitude of the upgrade.</p>
