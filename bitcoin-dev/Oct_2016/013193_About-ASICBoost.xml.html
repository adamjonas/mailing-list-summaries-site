    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo criticized anonymous miner "Satoshi Nakamoto" for not showing concern towards centralization pressure and its potential long-term harm to Bitcoin. However, it was revealed that Sergio had privately expressed concerns about centralization pressure and reached out to the BCF in 2013 to license his patent which would make its user(s) 30% more effective than others under "fair" terms. The BCF responded by encouraging him to seek the patent as they didn't think it would be a big deal.</p>
