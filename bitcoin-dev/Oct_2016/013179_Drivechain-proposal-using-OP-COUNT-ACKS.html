    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread contains a discussion about whether Rootstock's proposal is encumbered by patents or pending patents that would prevent it from being used in the bitcoin project. Andrew Johnson reminds the group that the purpose of the list is for technical discussion, not political disagreements. However, another member raises concerns about Rootstock's prior behavior of attempting to use patents offensively and suggests that Rootstock should provide a legally binding guarantee that they will not be using patents offensively. This requirement is common in standards bodies, either by having all companies contributing to the standards join a patent pool, or by making legally binding pledges/licenses to ensure that any patents they hold can't be used offensively.</p>
