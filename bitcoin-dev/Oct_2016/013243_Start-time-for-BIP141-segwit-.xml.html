    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the discussion is regarding the safety measures to be taken while deploying SegWit, a controversial soft-fork. Tom Zander explains that it is crucial to ensure that SegWit is properly supported by all miners because once activated, it cannot be rolled back in an environment where it is disputed. All transactions made during this time become everyone-can-spent transactions. Johnson Lau suggests that nobody should use SegWit transactions before it is fully activated. Zander clarifies that SegWit cannot be rolled back after people are allowed to send SegWit transactions and the risk of pushing it too soon could lead to real people losing real money. The grace period of two months or two weeks suggested by Lau would not make any difference in ensuring security. Zander emphasizes the importance of addressing the security issue and not stalling the process without any improvement. Zander provides the links to his blog and vlog for further information.</p>
