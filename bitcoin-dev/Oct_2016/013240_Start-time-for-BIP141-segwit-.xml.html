    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom Zander, a developer, has voiced his concern on the deployment of SegWit, which is a controversial soft-fork. He argues that using BIP9 to shorten the grace period is risky as it needs to be implemented in an extra-safe way due to its controversial nature. Once deployed, the feature cannot be rolled back, and all transactions made during this time will turn into everyone-can-spend transactions. Therefore, it is not advisable to use SegWit transactions before it is fully activated. Tom believes that there is no reason to use BIP9, as it was coded in an older client, and stalling the process for two months does not improve security.</p>
