        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Sidechains are a tool for scaling Bitcoin and allowing them to be transferred from the main blockchain into external blockchains. However, current thinking suggests that sidechains are isolated from each other, and moving Bitcoin between them would involve a slow transfer back to the mainchain. To address this issue, a protocol for addressable blockchains has been proposed that uses a shared proof of work, effectively acting as an Internet of Blockchains. The master sidechain is called Angel, and it sits at the top of a tree of blockchains with each having its own unique address, much like an IP address, and the Angel blockchain acting as a registrar. Creating a blockchain is as simple as getting a createBlockchain transaction included in an Angel block with details of parameters. Mining in Angel uses a standardized format creating hashes which allow all different blockchains to contribute to the same Angel proof of work. Children always synchronize and follow all parents, with parents aware of their children, allowing children to inherit a level of security from their parents without the same PoW difficulty.The Angel blockchain allows the free market to decide which approaches are successful and for complementary blockchains with different use cases such as privacy, high transaction volume, and Turing completeness to more seamlessly exist alongside each other using Bitcoin as the standard medium of exchange. Another idea is to compress the validation data maximally, to achieve Turing completeness for an arbitrary number of interacting chains or "namespaces". The whole thing is checkpointed and uses Zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure pruning, making it essentially a rolling blockchain with complete preservation of history.Every chain would be registered under a unique name and define its own external API towards other chains, and it would define its own rules for how its data can be updated and when. Every set of programs (transactions) can be transformed into a "diff" on the blockchain state plus an accompanying Zero-knowledge proof. The proofs can even be chained, so groups of users of one chain can create a proof for their changes, submit it to some chain coordinator who does another compressing merge and proof generation, to then send it to the miners who merge the collective changes for all chains and generate a proof for the root. However, validating these proofs can become inefficient if many chains interact, requiring more interaction from the client. To overcome this challenge, a Lightning Network-like solution would be needed to process programs in near real-time and quickly settle on changes to commit to the root. Such a solution would require programs to be designed for networking, allowing servers to negotiate over their APIs across all chains until a complete set of changes without conflicts is ready to be committed to the root.Overall, the proposed protocol for addressable blockchains using a shared proof of work has the potential to allow different blockchains to coexist seamlessly, with each having its own unique address and rules for updating data. The use of Zero-knowledge proofs and secure pruning enables the preservation of history while minimizing validation data. However, the validation process can become inefficient when many chains interact, making a Lightning Network-like solution necessary to process programs in near real-time and quickly settle on changes to commit to the root.</p>
