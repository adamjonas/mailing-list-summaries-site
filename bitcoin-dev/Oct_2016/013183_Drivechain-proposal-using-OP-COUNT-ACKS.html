    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the proposed drivechain for RSK (also known as Rootstock), a two-way pegged blockchain that allows for risk-less Bitcoin extensibility via sidechains/drivechains. The proposed system includes a new opcode, OP_COUNT_ACKS, which counts acks and nacks tags in coinbase fields and pushes the resulting totals onto the script stack. The design of the system aims to achieve properties such as interoperability with the scripting system, zero risk of invalidating a block, no additional computation during blockchain management and re-organization, and strong protection from DoS attacks, among others. However, there is concern about the validity of transactions being dependent on the block they are included in, and it is argued that the validity of a transaction should always be monotone. The added check lock time and check sequence number operations were carefully constructed to ensure this property. The full BIP and reference implementation can be found in the links provided.</p>
