        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion revolves around proposals to improve the Bitcoin protocol through a softfork. One proposal suggests using an unused code instead of OP_NOPx, while another considers a new witness version and additional field in the witness. There are concerns about limited coinbase space and potential poll space shortage.Sergio Demian Lerner has proposed a segwit-based and soft-forked opcode called OP_COUNT_ACKS to count acknowledgement tags in coinbase fields. The proposal aims to achieve zero risk of invalidating a block, strong protection from DoS attacks, and minimum block space consumption. Lerner will discuss the design at the Scaling Bitcoin event.The proposed system includes a new opcode that counts acks and nacks tags in coinbase fields and pushes the totals onto the script stack. Concerns were raised about the validity of transactions and the potential for double-spending. Transactions redeeming outputs containing or referencing OP_COUNT_ACKS are not broadcast by the network and can only be included by miners.There is a discussion about encumbrances on the proposal that could prevent its use in the Bitcoin project. Suggestions are made to resolve patent concerns, such as voluntary disclosure of patents with a free license or adopting a defensive patent strategy. Concerns are also raised about the validity of transactions being dependent on the block they are included in.The context also mentions the implementation of decentralised sidechains and the process of redemption from a side chain. It is noted that the speaker's understanding of sidechain developments may be incomplete.In another email thread, it is discussed whether Rootstock's proposal is encumbered by patents or pending patents. Suggestions are made for Rootstock to adopt a legally binding patent pledge or license to ensure their developments remain free and open. The purpose of the list is emphasized as technical discussion, not political disagreements.There is a conversation between Sergio Demian Lerner and Peter Todd about a down vote on Lerner's Rootstock proposal. Lerner suggests that Rootstock adopt a legally binding patent pledge/license, such as the Defensive Patent License (DPL), to continue collaborating. Todd raises concerns about Rootstock's prior behavior regarding patents and suggests guarantees to prevent offensive use of patents.Sergio Demian Lerner, Bitcoiner and RSK co-founder, has proposed a drivechain in the BIP draft that he hopes will be used as the foundation for new 2-way-pegged blockchains. This drivechain aims to expand the use cases of Bitcoin by allowing it to be taken to new niches and tested in different scenarios. The drivechain is designed with various key properties in mind, such as ensuring no risk of invalidating a block, minimizing additional computation during blockchain management and re-organization, offering strong protection against DoS attacks, consuming minimal block space, and eliminating the risk of cross-secondary chain invalidation.Lerner's proposal comes after expressing concerns over proposals from individuals or colleagues who have a history of patenting Bitcoin consensus relevant technology. He believes that this behavior poses a serious threat to decentralization and suggests that it needs to be addressed in a convincing and legally binding manner. To move forward, he proposes exploring Blockstream's patent pledges. However, Lerner NACKed the proposal due to its history of patenting. The proposal specifically pertained to drivechains which RSK (also known as Rootstock) intends to use for their two-way pegged blockchain implementation.In light of the approaching ScalingBitcoin event, Lerner saw it as an opportune time to publish the proposal on drivechains. While the full BIP and reference implementation can be found on GitHub, it should be noted that the code is still unaudited. Lerner will be available at ScalingBitcoin to discuss the design rationale, potential improvements, changes, and ideas related to the proposed drivechain.</p>
