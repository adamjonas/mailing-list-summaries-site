    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the conversation is related to a proposal made by an individual for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that had the effect of benefiting their ASICBOOST patent without disclosing it. The individual denies the accusation and explains that the BIP actually protects the network from stealth Shared-Nonce mining. The rejection of the BIP has made the Bitcoin network less secure, as it is unclear to what extent the mining method is in use. The ASICBOOST patent, according to the individual, protects Bitcoiners from mining centralization, and they have no control over the company that owns the technology. The individual proposes a community crowdfund to license the technology and put it into the public domain.</p>
