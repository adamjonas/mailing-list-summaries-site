    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 3, 2016, Sergio Demian Lerner proposed a use case for OP_COUNT_ACKS that would allow users to pay miners for any service they can provide as a group for the common good. This could include fee payment smoothing over many blocks or jointly buying better internet service to improve bandwidth or reduce latency between them. By sending bitcoins to a script containing OP_COUNT_ACKS requiring 51% of miners approval and adding a special text tag to such outputs such as "FOR-MINERS-TO-BUY-X", users can send bitcoins to miners and ask the majority of them to vote on the proposal. If accepted, it would create a transaction to redeem those funds. This approach could help address the tragedy of the commons problem that Bitcoin may face in the long term by users crowdfunding mining of the following n blocks.</p>
