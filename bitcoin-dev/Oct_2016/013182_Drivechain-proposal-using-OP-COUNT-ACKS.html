    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sergio Demian Lerner, a developer at RSK, has stated that the company is considering endorsing the Defensive Patent License (DPL) or taking other measures to ensure its developments remain free and open. The decision will involve discussions with his team and possibly legal advice, as patenting can be costly. Lerner confirms that RSK has not filed any patents nor is it planning to do so. He also notes that the drivechains concept, which RSK is adopting, is not an original idea of theirs but rather that of Paul Sztorc. Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer, responded positively to Lerner's announcement, stating that he would prioritize his own adoption of DPL and announce it on the mailing list.</p>
