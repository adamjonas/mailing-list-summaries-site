    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>After reading the DPL v1.1, Sergio believes that it poses a threat to Bitcoin users, making the technology fully proprietary and less valuable for future generations. The license allows companies that join it to enforce their patents against anyone who has chosen not to join, putting most Bitcoin users at risk of being sued by these companies. Even if they were to join, they may be required to pay royalties for inventions used prior to joining. DPL is also revocable, meaning that signers can force all new Bitcoin users to pay royalties if Bitcoin Core ends up using any DPL-covered patent. Sergio suggests that individuals in underdeveloped countries may not have access to patent attorneys or be able to afford their fees to advise them on the benefits and rights they are resigning. He proposes that every BIP and proposal sent to the Bitcoin mailing list should contain a note granting worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable license for the content of the email or BIP to prevent publishers from filing a US patent. Sergio makes it clear that he is not a lawyer and that his opinion is not advice. He urges everyone to read the DPL v1.1 and come to their own conclusions.</p>
