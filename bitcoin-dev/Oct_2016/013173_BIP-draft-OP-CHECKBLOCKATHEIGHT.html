    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 1st, 2016, Rusty Russell proposed a three-argument version for comparing gbits-to-compare, blocknum, and hash. He suggests that if the value is 0 or greater than 256, it would be invalid and if the hash length isn't equal to (+7)/8, it would also be invalid. This would cause zero padding on-chain which would be undesirable, so instead, he suggests having the consensus implementation do the padding. If the unused bits of the hash are not 0, it would also be invalid. Otherwise, the hash is compared to lower of the blockhash. However, there is uncertainty about the endian. Russell's version allows for gambling games on-chain. Luke mentions that this may put another nail in CBAH's coffin, but it could also resurrect it.</p>
