        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer, has made a significant declaration regarding his patents. He has declared himself and any technology companies he controls as "Defensive" by committing to offer a Defensive Patent License (DPL) for any of his patents, whether they exist currently or in the future, to any DPL User. It is worth noting that neither Peter Todd nor any companies under his control currently have any patents.The announcement was made on Peter Todd's website, petertodd.org, and includes a link to the transaction ID (txid) of a Bitcoin transaction containing the message. This adds transparency and verifiability to his commitment. It is important to highlight that Peter Todd is offering only a specific version of the DPL based on the advice of his lawyer. The inclusion of the language "all technology companies I control" is to prevent any complications with non-technology companies he may control in the future. Examples of such non-technology companies include family real-estate holding companies and the non-profit caving group he is a part of.As of now, Peter Todd only controls one company, which he considers a "technology company". This company is the numbered company through which he conducts all his consulting work. Therefore, the offer mentioned above applies to this company. Furthermore, if Peter Todd gains control of any other technology companies in the future, the same offer will apply to them.For those interested in contacting Peter Todd, he can be reached at the email address "pete@petertodd.org". His commitment to offering a Defensive Patent License demonstrates his dedication to promoting an open and collaborative approach to technological advancements within the Bitcoin community.</p>
