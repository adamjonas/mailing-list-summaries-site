    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the world of cryptocurrency, there is always a concern for fraudulent activity and ensuring the security of transactions. One issue that has been raised is receiving a block with a transaction that has not been broadcast to the network. While this is suspicious, there are cases where it can happen legitimately. For instance, if you are a new user, it is possible to receive blocks with unseen transactions since there is no way to obtain the memory pools of your peers today.On another note, there is a question about whether it would be safe to report the number of confirmations differently during a chain split for vectors variant. If an individual has a block but a majority of their peers relayed a block that split the chain, they could subtract one from each confirmation reported via RPC. This approach could potentially enhance safety measures for users in this scenario.</p>
