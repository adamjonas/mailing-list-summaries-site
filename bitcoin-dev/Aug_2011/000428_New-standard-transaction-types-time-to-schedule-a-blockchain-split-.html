    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin development team is discussing the issue of whitelisting the basic CHECKMULTISIG form, which currently has a bug in its code resulting in it expecting one extra item on the stack. While some believe that this would be a necessary step forward, others point out that there are some disadvantages to CHECKMULTISIG, including the fact that it is counted as 20 sigop operations in GetSigOpCount and therefore there can only be 1000 of these in a block. Furthermore, it looks less attractive when using HASH160 based addresses. There is also an ongoing discussion about whether to support more general cases or more specific cases, with some proposing focusing on a more general case due to ease of validation and less work for third-party software tracking.</p>
