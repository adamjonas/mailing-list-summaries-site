        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion on Bitcointalk initially revolved around the benefits of a thin client downloading only the headers. However, it was suggested that tx filtering is a better option as it allows only relevant transactions + merkle branches to be downloaded rather than every block, which can still lead to high costs as blocks get bigger. The conversation then shifted towards the sequence number and its role in contract protocols where one party needs to re-issue transactions without interacting with the other parties. Having seqnums on the inputs allows for the creation of a newer version of the transaction by resigning the input with a higher sequence number. This is defined by IsNewerThan(). The SIGHASH flags limit what can be changed, but this feature allows for particular types of contracts on the network's memory pool.Contracts, also known as smart contracts, serve a valuable purpose in reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing trust in certain types of transactions. They eliminate the need for trusted middlemen in certain situations. For example, Kickstarter relies on a middleman to collect and aggregate people's pledges for new creations. By using software with contracts, the artist or game programmer could run the program on their website and avoid having to pay fees.The process by which contracts move out of the memory pool and into a chain is through lock time or if every sequence number is UINT_MAX. While there may be complexities associated with contracts, they serve a valuable purpose in reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing trust in certain types of transactions.Mike Hearn suggested tx filtering as a better way to only get relevant transactions+merkle branches. A user suggested replacing a transaction they've already submitted but Hearn explained that the sequence number makes it more complex than that. This allows a kind of chain to be established and no one can rewind the transaction to an earlier point, but anyone can update it within the parameters established by the SIGHASH flags on the others signatures. The ability to pick a slightly different set of source inputs doesn't seem like a hugely useful feature, and the user withdraws their request. The transaction still has to connect to the same outputs as before, and thus import the same amount of value.</p>
