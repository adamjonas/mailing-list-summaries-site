    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sam Revitch, a developer, has proposed a new private key export format that includes simple password-protection. The proposed format is base-58 and intended as an interchange format, not specifically integrated with wallet encryption, and simple enough to be produced by the vanitygen program. He posted details of the scheme on bitcointalk.org and welcomes comments on it. However, importing to the official bitcoin client using a method like the import/export patch would require the user to provide the password of the private key in addition to the wallet password if the wallet is encrypted. Moreover, Sam Revitch makes a request to use one of the data classes proposed by Pieter Wuille about a month ago. If this doesn't fit with the general bitcoin development agenda, he is okay with it but would like to explore some possibility for a protected export format for private keys.</p>
