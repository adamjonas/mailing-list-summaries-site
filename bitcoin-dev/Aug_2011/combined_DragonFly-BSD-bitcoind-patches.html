        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 7, 2011, Venkatesh Srinivas shared three patches via email that allowed bitcoind to be compatible with DragonFly BSD. The first patch addressed an issue where bitcoind incorrectly assumed that SO_NOSIGPIPE was available on all BSDs, including NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly. This patch resolved the problem by testing for SO_NOSIGPIPE instead of making assumptions.The second patch focused on modifying the signedness of pchMessageStart in main.cpp and net.h. By changing it to 'unsigned char', the patch aimed to prevent unsafe values beyond 0x80. This adjustment was necessary to ensure the proper functioning and security of bitcoind on DragonFly BSD.The third patch dealt with a specific error in db.cpp. It qualified make_tuple as std::make_tuple to address a preference issue between std::make_tuple and boost's make_tuple. Without qualification, std::make_tuple was mistakenly favored over boost's make_tuple, leading to incorrect behavior. By explicitly specifying std::make_tuple, this error was fixed.Jeff Garzik, upon reviewing the patches, responded positively and created pull requests on GitHub. These patches were formatted using git format-patch and could be applied using git-am. Overall, these patches effectively enabled bitcoind to run smoothly on DragonFly BSD, ensuring compatibility and addressing potential issues.</p>
