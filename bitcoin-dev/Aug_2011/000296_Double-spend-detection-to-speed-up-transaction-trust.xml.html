    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin protocol, Andy Parkins suggests adding a new message type for double spend transactions to help with their detection in the network. Matt Corallo objects, arguing that it would result in unnecessary network traffic and add complexity to the protocol. He further argues that miners are the only ones who matter in determining which transaction gets confirmed. Parkins also raises concerns about small businesses trying to use the client without understanding the system and proposes the additional message as a solution for practical detection of double-spends. However, Corallo counters that effective prevention already exists and detection can be achieved with relatively little effort by making good connections. Ultimately, no consensus is reached on the proposal.</p>
