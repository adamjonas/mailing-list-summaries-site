        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 19, 2011, Luke-Jr proposed a patch to adapt one line of code necessary for supporting boost filesystem version 3. This version was the default in Boost 1.46+ and required for 1.48+. Luke-Jr confirmed that he had tested the patch with Boost 1.41.0 to ensure that it would still work on older versions. In response, Jeff Garzik acknowledged that the change appeared to be technically correct. However, he expressed disappointment that #ifdefs were used in the code. Jeff suggested that it would be better to hide this type of code in headers to keep the actual code cleaner. He noted that while this is only a general guideline and not a strict rule, there are already many instances of #ifdef windows code.Overall, Luke-Jr's patch aimed to support boost filesystem version 3 and was tested with older versions to ensure compatibility. Jeff Garzik recognized the technical correctness of the change but expressed a preference for minimizing the use of #ifdefs in the code.</p>
