    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 3, 2011, a discussion took place about the implementation of multiple signature escrowed transactions and making them deployable. The pull request 349 was proposed, which contained one candidate fix for multisig validation issues. However, this fix carried a risk of creating differences in how nodes validate transactions leading to lasting forks. Another way of fixing it would be to define that OP_PUSHDATA* cannot be used to push the smaller lengths, which could be more efficiently encoded with the direct length opcodes. The discussion also emphasized that the IsStandard part of the patch is uncontroversial and could go in quickly, while the full escrow feature set requires more testing and discussion before being added to the client. Therefore, it was suggested to split the 319 pull request into two: one which does the IsStandard change and one which adds the full escrow feature set. This way, when the escrow patch does enter the mainline client, it will meet up with a network which is happy to handle its transactions. It was noted that Eligius mining and probably other pools are open to the idea of upgrading, which means that non-standard transactions can still be mined in a reasonable time frame under one hour. However, it's not just a matter of mining power; it's also a question of propagation, as non-propagating transactions are extra vulnerable to double spending by a standard transaction. Overall, the conversation focused on the viability of implementing multiple signature escrowed transactions and the potential solutions to the multisig validation issue.</p>
