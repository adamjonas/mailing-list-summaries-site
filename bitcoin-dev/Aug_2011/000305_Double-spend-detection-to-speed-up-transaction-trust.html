    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated August 4, 2011, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern about people who connect to everyone causing harm. He cited nodes in .ru/.ua that connect to him aggressively and never pass a transaction in his available logs. Maxwell considered going through his logs to identify bad connections but was beaten to it by someone else. He questioned if such connections should not be dropped over time since they are clearly non-functioning nodes. The email also included a digitally signed message part as an attachment.</p>
