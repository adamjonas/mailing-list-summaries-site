    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post, Gavin Andresen mentioned the next few months' roadmap for Bitcoin development. The third point on his list was wallet security. He expressed his desire to ship Matt Corallo's wallet encryption soon as well as Bobby Groff's Multisign patch, which would allow the creation of secure wallet solutions that are trojan-resistant. Matt Corallo responded by saying that he thought there were only a few things left to do before 0.4 was released, such as testing and merging wallet import/export, fixing some bugs, and possibly pulling #319 sometime soon. He suggested that they focus on getting the IsStandard parts in 0.4 out first because they need to be released anyway. Bobby Groff then weighed in, saying that he did not think splitting the patch made much of a difference. He also believed that with unit test coverage for both this feature and existing script.cpp code, the patch was relatively low risk and could help pay down existing test debt.</p>
