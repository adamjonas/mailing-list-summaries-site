    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange in 2011, Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell and Mike Hearn discussed a problem with the peer-to-peer network being starved for connectable slots. Hearn suggested massively increasing all the anti-Denial of Service (DoS) limits in version 0.4, as they had caused more damage than they solved. However, Maxwell argued that increasing the number of available connection slots risked running nodes on lower memory systems out of memory. He also noted that 125 slots should be sufficient and that they needed to figure out why it wasn't enough.Maxwell mentioned that the anti-DoS limits were redone in version 0.24, so they should not cause any such issues in the future. Despite this, the issue of the peer-to-peer network being starved for connectable slots persisted, and they needed to find a solution.</p>
