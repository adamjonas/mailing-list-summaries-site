    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers in 2011, Jeff Garzik confirms that Bitcoin resends wallet transactions with zero confirmations and both sent and received transactions fall within the "wallet tx" superset. He had forgotten about the resend on the receiver side, though it makes sense when importing transactions from foreign sources such as receiving transactions via a USB flash drive. The conversation then shifts to the possibility of every node doing resends and implementing a TOR-like tunneling system. There is also a suggestion to use UDP packets with spoofed sender addresses, but it is deemed unreliable. Another developer suggests implementing TCP over UDP, which is already done in an implementation called UTP, and may be better than creating something from scratch.</p>
