    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, one of the Bitcoin core developers, has created a roadmap for the next few months. He has listed five priorities that include network health, detecting potential deadlocks early, wallet security, bug fixing and thorough testing. Andresen is looking for help with finding people or money to create a dedicated "core bitcoin quality assurance team". In addition to these priorities, he has listed several features he would like to see in future releases including client mode, moving from wxWidgets to qt for the GUI, and better detection/reaction to double spend attempts or block-chain splits. Andresen will create a Roadmap page on the Bitcoin wiki if there is general consensus about priorities.</p>
