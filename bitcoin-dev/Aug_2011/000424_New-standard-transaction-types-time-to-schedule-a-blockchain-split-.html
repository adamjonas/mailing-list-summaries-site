    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a GitHub pull request has proposed a scheme that can convert arbitrary expressions over signature-checks to Bitcoin scripts. The proposal suggests defining an address type that encodes an expression in RPL form to make it more compact and easily parseable. However, there are concerns from a mobile apps perspective as it doesn't make sense to have arbitrary scripts in a user-facing address. The software needs to present a reasonable user interface given an address and explain what is going to happen to the user's money. Doing pattern matching against some encoded script template is considered annoying and inefficient. It would be better to define another type of URI for each kind of transaction to be supported since often out-of-band protocols are required for more interesting contracts. The "address" would specify additional information not found in the final output script, like a rendezvous point.</p>
