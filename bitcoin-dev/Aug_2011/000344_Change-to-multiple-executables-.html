    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 10, 2011, Dr. Andy Parkins expressed his frustration with the aggressive rejection of new ideas from potential Bitcoin developers. He argues that while a list of things for developers to work on is valuable, it should not be the only way to contribute to the project. Parkins suggests a more distributed method, similar to Linux-next, where potential projects can easily be layered on top of the existing Bitcoin development structure by motivated volunteers. He points out that many abandoned feature branches for Bitcoin sit as pull requests on GitHub and that many projects have "specially compiled" versions of Bitcoin because the official client doesn't do what they need and won't accept their patches. Furthermore, he shares a list of ideas he has had that were all shot down by one or more main developers. Despite liking Bitcoin, Parkins warns that he is unsurprised and unsympathetic to complaints about a lack of new developers fixing bugs, and wonders if he should hang around or go work on his own implementation.</p>
