    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 3rd, 2011, Mike Hearn posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding issues with DNS seeds. He noted that there were a lot of bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds and that it was slowing down peer bringup for Android apps. Hearn mentioned a conversation he had with a friend about Bitcoin and hoped that his friend might take on DNS seeding as a project. He suggested a custom DNS server that would watch the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version in order to resolve the issue. Rick Wesson responded to Hearn's post, expressing interest in contributing to the DNS seeding project and asking for clarification on what constitutes long-lived peers. Hearn responded by suggesting sorting nodes by version, how long they've been observed to exist, and the last polling time, among other factors. Additionally, Hearn suggested starting from Matt's code, which is written in PHP, or alternatively writing a Java app and linking drop-in DNS serving libraries with BitCoinJ+sqlite.</p>
