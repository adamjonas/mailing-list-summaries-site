    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between developers on the bitcoin-development mailing list in August 2011, one developer expressed their opinion that while anonymity and pseudonymity were nice features, they did not deserve the full focus of the developers. The core of the protocol is about making transactions in a secure and fast way, not allowing everybody to be anonymous, whether they want to or not. TOR was already a good option for those who want to stay anonymous, and there was no need to pull support into the main client if only a few would use it. The developer saw no need for action from the developer side. The thread also discussed the possibility of every node doing resends, implementing a TOR-like tunneling system just for the first leg of transactions, and using UDP packets with spoofed sender addresses. One developer pointed out the unreliability of the idea, while another mentioned the implementation of TCP over UDP called UTP, which could be used if the decision was made to use UDP.</p>
