    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Andy Parkins and Matt Corallo, the topic of double-spending transactions was discussed. Parkins suggested adding MSG_DOUBLESPEND to the inventory list to prevent this issue, but Corallo argued that it would add unnecessary network complexity and more messages for people to know about. The discussion continued with Parkins pointing out that double spend transactions could enter the network at two reasonably evenly connected points, causing each to only be seen by half the network. Corallo countered that what miners believe is all that matters and suggested that a Bitcoin backbone or large miners and merchants could help prevent double spends nearly perfectly. Parkins expressed his desire for small businesses to have practical answers instead of the current "0/unconfirmed" system, and Corallo noted that Bitcoin is still an experiment and no future is guaranteed.</p>
