    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Christian Decker, they discussed the possibility of adding an RSA-like scheme for m-out-of-n signatures to work with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This scheme would distribute key shares as points on a curve with the actual key as a 0-value. However, Maxwell pointed out that this solution would not solve the issue of malware on a user's PC because it requires simultaneous access to all key-parts. Maxwell proposed an alternative solution that involves providing methods to export/import unsigned transactions, running the GUI in a way that can track a user's addresses with only pubkeys available to the client, and providing methods to sign and import/export/broadcast signed transactions. With these tools, offline wallets become feasible, and when combined with wallet crypto, it is the best way to protect users from themselves without being too complicated for them to use.</p>
