    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, Gregory expressed his concern over the possibility of waiting less than six blocks before leaving unconfirmed status. However, some people are already considering transactions as 'confirmed enough' at less than six blocks; 3 is considered to be the magic number for ClearCoin. InstaWallet's "green" payments are an example of ways in which individuals are accepting 0-confirmation transactions safely. Given the demand for "as fast as possible" confirmation, Gavin Andresen suggested adding a placeholder to the RPC interface or a signed integer "trust" rating for blocks/transactions to address the issue. The idea of miners connecting themselves together in a semi-trusted "bitcoin backbone" was also discussed, with Matt submitting a patch to connect and stay connected to a set of nodes. However, Gavin suggested that the networking code needs an overhaul to implement a priority queue of potential peers. Trusted peers would be sorted to near the top of the queue while peers with bad behavior would be placed at the bottom. Peer rotation could mitigate manipulate-time and other Sybil attacks.</p>
