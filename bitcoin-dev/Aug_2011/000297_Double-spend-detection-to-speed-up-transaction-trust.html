    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-development mailing list is about double-spend transactions and how to detect them. One option is for each mining pool to offer a realtime feed of accepted TXs. In order to accomplish this, the author is working on a minimal bitcoind patch that writes raw accepted TXs and BLOCKs to stdout with a prefix of ("2naXaRQj--TX\n%d\n" % (data_length)). The author also plans to create a minimal NodeJS app which invokes bitcoind as a subprocess, parses the TXs and BLOCKs, and offers a realtime feed. There is a debate between members of the mailing list about the necessity of detecting double-spend transactions. One member argues that it is important because it prevents chain forks and eventual reorgs, while another argues that it is not necessary because Bitcoin already prevents double-spends. There are also concerns raised about adding more network traffic and adding another message type. However, the author argues that their proposal is backward compatible and will not affect those who do not know about it. Finally, the author acknowledges that they are just a nobody around here and that their suggestion may not be implemented.</p>
