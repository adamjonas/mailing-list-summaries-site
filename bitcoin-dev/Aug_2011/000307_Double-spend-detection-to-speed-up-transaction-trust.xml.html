    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email consists of two semi-random thoughts from Gavin Andresen. Firstly, he agrees that extending the protocol to make double-spend detection better is probably not a good idea. However, he suggests extending the information reported by the listtransactions/gettransaction API calls to report detected double spends. Currently, the code just drops double spends, which means if this were implemented, the implementation would have to be careful about being vulnerable to a "fill memory with bogus transactions" attack. Secondly, Gavin Andresen expresses his desire for somebody to start experimenting with algorithms for detecting well-behaved and ill-behaved nodes, starting with a dns-seed implementation. He suspects that people are beginning to experiment with various types of Sybil attacks, which might explain why network connectivity has been so bad. The email was sent from the Sydney airport before a very long flight back to Massachusetts.</p>
