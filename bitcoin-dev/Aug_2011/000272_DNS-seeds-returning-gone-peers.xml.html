    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email correspondence, Mike Hearn discusses the issue of bad nodes appearing in DNS seeds, which slows down peer bringup for Android apps. He shares the output of his nmap command and concludes that out of 48 IPs returned, only 19 are actually usable. However, another participant in the conversation points out that it's actually much less since filtered nodes are also worthless and there is no way to tell if a node has its connection slots full without making an actual connection. Mike Hearn suggests that a custom DNS server that watches the network and finds long-lived peers running the latest version would be helpful for resolving this kind of thing. He mentions talking to a friend who may take on DNS seeding as a project and recommends pointing him to <a href="https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed,">https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed,</a> which could use some cleanup but works. Finally, he notes that using a different DNS server that pulls directly from the database in a more dynamic way might work better.</p>
