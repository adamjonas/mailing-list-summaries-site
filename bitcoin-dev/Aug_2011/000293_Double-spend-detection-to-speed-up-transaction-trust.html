    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2011 email exchange between Bitcoin developers, Matt Corallo proposed adding a message type to the official client to help detect double spend transactions. He argued that this would prevent chain forks and make it easier for small businesses to use Bitcoin by giving them practical answers instead of "0/unconfirmed" notifications. The proposal involved adding a new enum MSG_DOUBLESPEND, which would not add additional network traffic as it was backward compatible and would only be seen when needed. While some developers objected, Corallo argued that Bitcoin was still an experiment and that such changes could help prevent potential financial losses.</p>
