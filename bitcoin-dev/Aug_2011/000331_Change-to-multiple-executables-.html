    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 10, 2011, Matt Corallo and John Smith discussed the idea of splitting the mainline client into separate executables for various reasons. John Smith proposed that the split should include bitcoind, bitcoin(-qt), and bitcoincl, with all three built by default. However, Corallo disagreed with the idea of splitting into more executables but did agree about splitting off bitcoincl. Corallo was less sure about splitting UI and RPC, as he often ran the UI and switched to RPC calls to inspect some details. Regarding bitcoin-qt, Corallo suggested that it be pull-requested, and he believed it should be merged whether or not there were autotools. The problem, however, was that bitcoin-qt was built using qmake while the rest were built using makefiles. Despite this, Corallo thought that bitcoin-qt was mature enough to replace wxbitcoin and wanted to see it in mainline. Finally, he asked how streamlined the process of building bitcoin-qt on Windows and OSX was and suggested switching everything to qmake until a maintained autotools was present.</p>
