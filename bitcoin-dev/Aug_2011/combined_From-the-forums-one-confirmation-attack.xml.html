    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2011, a discussion was held between Bitcoin developers Gavin Andresen and theymos regarding the possibility of an attack on the Bitcoin network that could lead to double-spending. They discussed the idea of nodes relaying new transactions as if they had received them normally, which would prevent the double-spending transaction from being accepted by most of the network. However, they noted that this method can be bypassed by attackers who simultaneously release the block and conflicting transaction to different nodes or inject the conflicting transaction into many places in the network at once.Andresen suggested using a metric based on waiting for a certain number of blocks before confirming a transaction as it provides robustness against almost all attack patterns. He also described an attack pattern where an attacker runs many widely distributed sybil nodes and creates two accounts at MoronBank. The attacker makes deposits in both partitions and conflicting transactions in the opposite partitions while carefully filtering out these transactions from crossing the boundary. After the funds show up in MoronBank, the attacker withdraws and drops the partitioning. This attack doesn't require the attacker to have any hash power and externalizes the lost income from orphaned blocks to victimized miners. The attack is killed dead by nodes adding in a few manually configured peerings, which don't need to be trusted but just need to not all go to a single bad-guy conspiracy. All major miners should be fully meshed for this purpose. However, they don't currently have software for this as addnode doesn't worry about keeping the links up, and the major pools don't seem to be interested in participating.</p>
