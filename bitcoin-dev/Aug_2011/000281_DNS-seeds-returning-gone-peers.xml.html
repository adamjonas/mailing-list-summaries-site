    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris is curious about whether his non-blocking network stack, BitDroid, would be better suited for detecting and tracking available peers. He has implemented several benchmarks and a simple peer counter listener that can open several hundred connections to check reachability of the peers and keep a pool of peers connected to listen for address broadcasts, with minimal overhead. Rick suggests sorting nodes by version and publishing addresses under version.example.com if the version has a preference. Mike Hearn mentions that there is currently no project but starting from Matt's code is probably the way to go. He also suggests writing a Java app for it as there are drop-in DNS serving libraries that could be linked with BitCoinJ+sqlite. Mike is hoping to find a friend who might take on DNS seeding as a project. A custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version would be helpful for resolving this kind of thing.</p>
