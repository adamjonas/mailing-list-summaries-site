    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Matt Corallo and Andy Parkins discuss the possibility of adding a MSG_DOUBLESPEND message to Bitcoin's inventory list. While Corallo believes it is unnecessary given that double-spend transactions are already prevented by the network, Parkins argues that it would be useful for small vendors such as vending machines, newspaper salesmen, and beer sellers who might not have incoming connections enabled and cannot afford to wait for payment confirmations. Parkins suggests peering with large miners and merchants to modify clients to keep both double-spent transactions in memory pool until one confirms. Corallo counters that small businesses can already use the client to prevent double-spends and that adding MSG_DOUBLESPEND would add unnecessary complexity to the network. They agree to disagree on the issue.</p>
