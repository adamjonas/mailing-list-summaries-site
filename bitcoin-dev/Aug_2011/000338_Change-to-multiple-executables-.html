    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent by John Smith on August 10, 2011 at 1:45:42 PM, he discussed the differences between two versions of a software. According to Smith, version 0.3.x would include small changes, bug fixes and maintain compatibility with the previous version, whereas version 0.4.x would feature major changes and refactorings that would eventually lead to a major release. Smith also suggested the possibility of having an "experimental" branch for features that might not make it into any stable release due to lack of use or interest. This experimental branch would allow for testing and development of new features without impacting the stability of the software's main releases.</p>
