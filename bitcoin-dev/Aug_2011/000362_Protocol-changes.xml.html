    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on Bitcointalk, Mike Hearn suggested tx filtering as a better way to only get relevant transactions+merkle branches. He explains that otherwise cost is still O(system activity) not O(your activity) as blocks get bigger, even if users don't download every block. A user suggested replacing a transaction they've already submitted but Hearn explained that the sequence number makes it more complex than that. This allows a kind of chain to be established and no one can rewind the transaction to an earlier point, but anyone can update it within the parameters established by the SIGHASH flags on the others signatures. The ability to pick a slightly different set of source inputs doesn't seem like a hugely useful feature, and the user withdraws their request. The transaction still has to connect to the same outputs as before, and thus import the same amount of value.</p>
