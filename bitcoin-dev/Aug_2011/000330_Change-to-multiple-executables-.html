    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 10, 2011, Matt Corallo and Jeff Garzik discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of separating the Bitcoin daemon from the user interface (UI) executable. Corallo argued that this would add unnecessary complexity for users, who would now have to open both executables instead of just one. Garzik disagreed, stating that a separate headless daemon is common in other client/server-based programs and would allow for building a command line RPC client without also building the server or UI. Despite this debate, UI still had RPC functionality with -server. The UI linked both the UI and network code together until they were eventually separated out, and the preferred communication method was through RPC. Separating the daemon from the UI would provide more flexibility for remote control of the Bitcoin daemon and potentially simplify future development efforts.</p>
