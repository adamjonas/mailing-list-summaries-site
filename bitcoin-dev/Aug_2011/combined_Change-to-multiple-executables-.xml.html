    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made to split the current mainline client into separate executables, which was met with mixed reactions. The proposed split included bitcoind as a bitcoin daemon, bitcoin(-qt) as a bitcoin GUI executable, and bitcoincl as a bitcoin RPC command line. Some users were in favor of the split for clarity and simplification purposes, while others argued that it would complicate things for little advantage. It was suggested that splitting off bitcoincl would be useful, but splitting the GUI and daemon would not be, as it can already be achieved through bitcoind. There were also discussions on the deficiencies of the current protocol, which may require an incompatible change in the future, but it was agreed that a dev branch is needed for this purpose. Finally, there were suggestions to streamline the build process by switching everything to qmake, thereby allowing bitcoin-qt to replace wxbitcoin in mainline.</p>
