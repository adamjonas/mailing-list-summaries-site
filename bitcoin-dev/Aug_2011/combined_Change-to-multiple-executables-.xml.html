        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread from August 2011, Bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille responded to a proposal by John Smith to split the mainline client into separate executables. Smith suggested having bitcoind as the bitcoin daemon, bitcoin(-qt) as the bitcoin GUI executable and bitcoincl as the bitcoin RPC command line. Pieter Wuille initially misunderstood the proposal and suggested alternative names for executables: bitcoin-gui (or bitcoin-qt), bitcoin-server, and bitcoin-client. He also proposed offering a script or symlinked executable with the names "bitcoin" and "bitcoind" that would detect whether RPC commands are present on the command line. Wuille clarifies that he is all for Smith's proposal to remove the RPC client from the gui/daemon executable. He believes that some dev branch is needed to deal with changes to the protocol. While it is possible to change protocol deficiencies in the future, Wuille noted that doing so would still require carrying around both the old and new code until at least block height X. For now, Wuille thinks that splitting the source into separate library-ish components is necessary but disagrees with splitting into more executables. Matt Corallo agrees with Wuille about the more clear split of the source but does not like the idea of splitting into more executables.</p>
