    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed that if there was going to be a blockchain split, it would make sense to try and fix as many problems as possible. The proposed solutions included replacing hard limits with something that can dynamically adapt with the times and adjusting difficulty every block without limits based on a sliding window. Additionally, Andresen suggested replacing the "Satoshi" 64-bit integers with "Satoshi" variable-size fractions, which would create infinite possibilities of future division, allowing people to do nBTC and pBTC, and exact 1/3 of any quantity. This would increase transaction size based on the number of primes involved in an amount, encouraging discarding annoying primes in transaction fees. Finally, it was suggested to standardize everything on network (big) endian. Overall, Andresen believed that if there were to be a blockchain split, it would be best to fix as many issues as possible at the same time.</p>
