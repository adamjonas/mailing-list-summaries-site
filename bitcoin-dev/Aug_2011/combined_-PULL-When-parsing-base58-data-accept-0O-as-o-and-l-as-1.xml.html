        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 12, 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed an updated variable name in a branch of Bitcoin. He suggested that "pszDecode58" should be changed to "pnDecode58". Gavin was concerned about the potential confusion or difficulties that could arise due to this change. He mentioned that vanity addresses might not work on blockexplorer because people may not bother changing their code. However, he suggested that graceful handling of the typos would be sensible. Luke-Jr made a simple modification to allow base58 inputs to use zero and uppercase 'O' in place of lowercase 'O', as well as lowercase 'L', bar/pipe, and exclamation point in place of one. This modification increases tolerance when inputting addresses or other data by manual typing and provides more variety to vanity addresses. The link to the modification is <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3gpvrhm">http://tinyurl.com/3gpvrhm</a> and can be accessed via git fetch.</p>
