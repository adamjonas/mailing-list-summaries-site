    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 11, 2011, Andy Parkins and Joel Joonatan Kaartinen discussed a proposal for backward compatibility in which changes be collected into one single release rather than implemented piecemeal. Andy had been expressing frustration that his ideas were being shot down without constructive feedback, prompting Joel to ask for more specific feedback on what should be done instead. Andy responded with a list of proposed changes, including loading the block chain in reverse, transaction-only requests, removing checksumming and verack, storing script parameters outside the script, and requesting blocks by transaction hash instead of block hash. He also asked to be directed to previous discussions on these topics if they had already occurred. Dr. Andy Parkins signed off the email with his contact information.</p>
