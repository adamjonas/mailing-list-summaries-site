    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A patch was proposed by Luke-Jr on August 19, 2011, to adapt one line of code needed to support boost filesystem version 3. This version was the default in Boost 1.46+ and required for 1.48+. Luke-Jr tested the patch with Boost 1.41.0 to ensure it still worked on older versions. Jeff Garzik responded on August 24, 2011, stating that the change appeared to be technically correct but expressed disappointment that #ifdefs were used in the code. However, as it was only one line, it could be removed once the old APIs were no longer necessary.</p>
