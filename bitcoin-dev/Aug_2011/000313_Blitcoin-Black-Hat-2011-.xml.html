    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that the recipient re-broadcasts transactions, allowing for both the sender and recipient to be found. This tactic could potentially lead to the discovery of the IP address for any recipient Bitcoin address, provided a client with the private key connects to the network occasionally. By sending a transaction guaranteed not to be written into a block by a miner and monitoring who rebroadcasts it over several days or weeks, one may be able to identify the recipient. Additionally, this method could also be used to track down those in possession of stolen coins.</p>
