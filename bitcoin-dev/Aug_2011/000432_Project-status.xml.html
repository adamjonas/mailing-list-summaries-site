    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a quick brain dump on multiple topics, Gavin Andresen mentioned that he is working on a fix for the deadlock bugs caused by the new wallet encryption and/or CWallet refactoring in order to release version 0.4. He plans to reduce the number of locks and ensure they are consistently acquired, while also working on reworking the design based on boost::asio and using fewer threads in the long term. Other items on the 0.4 to-do list include implementing a block chain checkpoint, an updated list of hard-coded seed nodes, Pieter's dump/import privkey patch, and an update pull for his build. After Gavin's talk at the conference, Alex Waters expressed interest in becoming the core bitcoin Q/A lead. This involves creating test plans, staying on top of the issues list, testing new features, suggesting improvements to the code/test/release process, and anything else he deems necessary to improve core bitcoin.</p>
