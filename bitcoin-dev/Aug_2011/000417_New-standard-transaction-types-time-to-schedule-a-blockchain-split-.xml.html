    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from August 25, 2011 between Michael Grønager and Gavin Andresen, the idea of being able to pay directly into an escrow using an address is discussed. Grønager suggests that instead of having the customer bypass the clerk and have three key addresses, it would be simpler to implement a multisign transaction after the money has been received as a transfer to a safe, which would cover the majority of use cases. However, he notes that the ability to have usable addresses that encode a couple of escrow destinations should be an eventual feature. Andresen questions how often the 1-of-3 and 3-of-3 cases will be used, suggesting they may not be necessary to include in the code. Grønager argues that the 3-of-3 case is important for group trust accounts and believes that use cases should not be dropped unless they cannot be tested sufficiently. He agrees to spend time testing whichever cases make it into the code. The discussion highlights the need for security measures in the face of potential threats such as malware turning a computer against its user and emphasizes the importance of considering all possible use cases when designing a system.</p>
