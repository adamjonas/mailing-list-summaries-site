        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer named Sam Revitch has proposed a new private key export format that includes simple password-protection. The proposed format is base-58 and intended as an interchange format, not specifically integrated with wallet encryption, and simple enough to be produced by the vanitygen program. He posted details of the scheme on bitcointalk.org and welcomes comments on it.However, importing to the official bitcoin client using a method like the import/export patch would require the user to provide the password of the private key in addition to the wallet password if the wallet is encrypted. Moreover, Sam Revitch makes a request to use one of the data classes proposed by Pieter Wuille about a month ago. If this doesn't fit with the general bitcoin development agenda, he is okay with it but would like to explore some possibility for a protected export format for private keys.In addition, a revised description of the password-protected export format has been posted, which now includes multiple algorithms and a parameter byte for selecting the encryption parameters. The thread is available on bitcointalk.org, and unless there is an existing or other planned use for data class 32, it will be used for password-protected private keys. Sipa's description indicates that this would mean that a password-protected private key for bitcoin is type 32 and type 79 for the testnet. The proposal seems to have no objections thus far. Overall, these developments suggest ongoing efforts to improve the security of the Bitcoin network by implementing more advanced encryption measures for private keys.</p>
