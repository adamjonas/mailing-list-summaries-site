        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread from August 3, 2011, Mike Hearn suggested that there was a bigger problem than the anti-DoS limits in the 0.4 version of the p2p network, which is short of connectable slots. Gregory Maxwell responded that increasing the number of connection slots would risk running nodes on lower memory systems out of memory. He also believed that 125 slots should be sufficient and they needed to figure out why it wasn't. In another email from the same day, Mike Hearn mentions a lot of bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds, with only 19 out of 48 IPs being usable. This has slowed down peer bringup for Android apps, which don't currently save addresses of last-used peers. Hearn proposes a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version as a solution. Matt also suggests using <a href="https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed,">https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed,</a> which could use some cleanup but works. A different DNS server could pull directly from the database in a more dynamic way.</p>
