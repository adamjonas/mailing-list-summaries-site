    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the current mainline client, all functions are lugged into one executable, with an optional daemon-only one. However, this is viewed as a bad idea by some, and a proposal has been made to separate the functions into three different executables: bitcoind (bitcoin daemon), bitcoin(-qt) (bitcoin GUI executable), and bitcoincl (bitcoin RPC command line). By default, all three would be built, but in non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and bitcoincl would be built. The advantages of this proposal include making it clearer for the user, simplifying the main functions, and preventing the UI from doubling as a daemon, which would save memory. Additionally, separating the UI and daemon from their RPC call functions would prevent accidentally launching the daemon/UI locally if a user just wants to send a command over JSONRPC.</p>
