    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Aaradhya Chauhan, a member of the Bitcoin-dev group, is seeking the opinions of fellow enthusiasts on the topic of dust protection measures. She believes that while 1 sat/vB was a reasonable measure when Bitcoin's price was much lower, it is now too high and should be lowered slightly. She suggests that even if not immediately lowered, it should be halved when prices double and remain constant at that point. She argues that this change can be easily made with the support of full node operators as it is not a consensus rule. However, a potential roadblock to this proposal is that a few miners will need to use a lower minrelaytxfee for it to work. This may not be favorable for miners who do not want to lower their profits. Aaradhya supports Lightning Network but also believes that transaction affordability should remain constant in the future. She argues that if someone is willing to wait in a queue, they should have the option for the same affordability for minimum fees in the future as it is today, similar to how we still have email even though posts still exist. The email was sent with Proton Mail secure email, and the sender's name is /dev/fd0.</p>
