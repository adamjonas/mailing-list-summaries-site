    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this context suggests that there are certain limitations to communication within logged channels, and that misunderstandings can sometimes be resolved more effectively in person or through the use of Chatham House rules. As a solution, they propose restarting the Scaling Bitcoin conferences twice a year. The author also requests that the agenda for these conferences include a discussion about the benefits of not waiting to develop covenant designs, as even imperfect designs can help allocate developer interest in exploring different use cases. They suggest asking advanced scripting technologists to clarify which aspects of their work are science, engineering, or product-oriented, with understandable delivery dates. The author believes that having a better understanding of these topics could lead to more incremental exploration of the space.</p>
