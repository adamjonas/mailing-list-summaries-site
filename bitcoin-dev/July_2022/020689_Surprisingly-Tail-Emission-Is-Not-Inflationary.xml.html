    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user alicexbt suggested reducing `consensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval` for mainnet in `chainparams.cpp` to 195000. This would reduce the number of halvings from 34 to 14 and result in a block subsidy of 0 when it becomes less than 0.01, though it is unclear if this would be a soft fork. User ZmnSCPxj had previously proposed preparing for a future where the block subsidy may need to be removed before the existing schedule removes it, due to a majority coalition of miners deciding to censor certain transactions without community consensus. They noted that forcing the block subsidy to 0 would be a soft fork, which is easier to deploy. Peter Todd questioned the benefit of going through a political headache for what he assumed would be an insignificant change in total miner revenue, and asked if alicexbt thought total transaction fees at that point would be less than 0.01BTC.</p>
