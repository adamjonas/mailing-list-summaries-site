    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Aaradhya Chauhan suggested that the minimum output amount policy (dust limit) of one satoshi per virtual byte (vB) is now too high and can be easily lowered. However, David A. Harding clarified that this policy should not be confused with the minimum transaction relay feerate policy, which is also currently set at 1 sat/vB. While discussions about removing the dust limit have taken place in the past year, lowering the minimum relay feerate was seriously proposed four years ago in a patch to Bitcoin Core. However, challenges such as preventing denial/degradation-of-service attacks and dealing with a fragmented userbase make it less attractive. Furthermore, lowering the minimum relay feerate would only result in small economic benefits, as users may save $1,800 USD per day and miners earn an additional $200 USD per day if the fee rate is reduced to 1/10th its current value.</p>
