    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, James MacWhyte, has argued that discussions about the loss of mining rewards are "fatally shortsighted" and that there will be enough adoption worldwide to make mining profitable around the clock, even if the mining reward were minimal, within 10 years. He points out that the world's population is unevenly distributed, with 99% receiving sunlight, and that the Pacific Ocean is enormous and sparsely populated. Another member of the mailing list, Peter Todd, responds by stating that designing protocols for a rising price of Bitcoin forever is a bad idea.</p>
