    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd suggests that the only feasible way to smooth out fees is to have a separate mandatory category of fees, such as a fixed time-based fee that goes to timelocked anyone-can-spend outputs in the coinbase. The economic impact of inflation could then be achieved by pushing the fee forward to other miners. However, it is unclear what the implications would be of charging coins for moving based on their value times how long since they last moved.Instead, a scheme that could work would be to have a fixed minimum fee of satoshis/vbyte, which is required to be repaid by the miner into a pool, and they get back a fixed fraction of what was in that pool. The pool could simply be a rolling coin that keeps the balance. This emergency measure is a soft fork, does not significantly lessen block size, and is fairly coherent. Overall, this is the best emergency measure that Peter Todd is aware of.</p>
