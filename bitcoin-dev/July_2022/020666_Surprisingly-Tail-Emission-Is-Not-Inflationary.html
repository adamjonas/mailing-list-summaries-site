    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article delves into the issue of a fixed block reward and its impact on the supply of Bitcoin. The author uses modeling to demonstrate that lost coins result in a stable monetary supply, with neither inflationary nor deflationary conditions. The feasibility of adding tail emission to Bitcoin is also discussed, but it would require convincing the Bitcoin community of its benefits for implementation.The Bitcoin Developer Mailing List, hosted by the Linux Foundation, is an online forum for developers working on the Bitcoin network to discuss issues related to the development of the system. It allows for the sharing of ideas and proposed changes, as well as resolving problems. The list has a strong and active community of contributors, ranging from experienced developers to newcomers looking to learn more about Bitcoin development.The Bitcoin network is a decentralized digital currency operating through a peer-to-peer network, wherein transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Miners validate and add new transactions to the chain. Regular updates and improvements are made to the system to keep up with ongoing development.The Linux Foundation, which hosts the Bitcoin Developer Mailing List, is a nonprofit organization supporting open source software development. It provides various services to support open source projects, including hosting mailing lists, providing training and certification programs, and organizing events. Its mission is to promote the use and growth of open source technologies.In summary, the Bitcoin Developer Mailing List is an essential resource for developers looking to contribute to the ongoing development of the Bitcoin network. Hosted by the Linux Foundation, the list provides a platform for discussion and collaboration among developers working on the system. The foundation's support for open source software development is an important contribution to the growth and sustainability of the Bitcoin network and other open source projects.</p>
