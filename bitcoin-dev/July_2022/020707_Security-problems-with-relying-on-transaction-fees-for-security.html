    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around the potential consequences of the block subsidy decreasing to zero and the emergence of anyone-can-spend outputs. Russell O'Connor suggested that miners would attempt to bribe other miners to work on their block instead of reorganizing it, but Peter Todd warned of the disaster this would cause for mining centralization as smaller miners would need to pay larger bribes than larger miners. Additionally, a new type of transaction that is only valid in specific blocks would need to be added to prevent reorganizations and theft. This would require a signature that commits to the non-segwit part of the coinbase outputs.</p>
