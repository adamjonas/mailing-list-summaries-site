        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list addressed the compatibility of zero-knowledge proofs, such as Schnorr, with address message signing. The public key cannot be retrieved from the address or signature, making it difficult to prove the authenticity of a Schnorr signature. This was an intentional design choice in BIP340, which prioritized batch verifiability over public key recovery. It was suggested to work on BIP322, which is compatible with every script type and trivially extensible to future schemes. Pieter Wuille mentioned that every Taproot compatible wallet has a BIP340 implementation.The author of a post on Bitcointalk discussed implementing address/message signing support for Taproot, specifically Schnorr signatures. BIP340 has already made this a standard, but there are differences in encoding and public key requirements. Zero-knowledge proofs such as Schnorr are not compatible with address message signing as the public key cannot be retrieved from the address or signature. The article questioned whether the community wants message signatures at all, given the growing disproportion between legacy addresses and other addresses. In the same BIP discussion, it was clarified that BIP340 does not support key recovery and had to choose between supporting batch validation or public key recovery. The decision was made to support batch validation instead. Every taproot compatible wallet has a BIP340 implementation for transaction signing. If a wallet supports taproot signing, they already have code to produce BIP340 signatures, so message signing would be irrelevant if they do not support taproot signing.</p>
