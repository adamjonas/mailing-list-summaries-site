    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread, Michael Folkson discusses the potential role of a half aggregation BIP draft and the challenges of implementing CISA/CISHA as a consensus change. According to Folkson, it is too early to formalize what the equivalent of BIP341/342 for this draft BIP would look like. However, there are use cases for this half aggregation BIP that can be worked on today, such as Lightning gossip. Folkson notes that there would need to be two tiers of verification if CISA/CISHA was attempted in the long term, one for single signature key path spends where CISA/CISHA could be applied and another for Taproot script paths where it couldn't be applied. It could even be the case that a new output type is defined specifically for the CISA/CISHA use case where there is no access to a script path at all. With SegWit v0, the intention is to get the entire community to move to the new output type, but in the future, users may pick an output type depending on their use case. Despite these long-term considerations, Folkson suggests focusing on the use cases for the half aggregation BIP that can be worked on today. He also provides links to the CISA repo which describes some of the challenges of implementing CISA/CISHA as a consensus change and a Sigagg case study on LN channel announcements.</p>
