    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ali Sherief asked for clarification on the recovery of public keys from single-key signatures in relation to BIP340. The response clarified that BIP340 does not support key recovery and had to choose between supporting batch validation or public key recovery. The decision was made to support batch validation instead. The conversation then shifted to the implementation of BIP340 in taproot compatible wallets. The response stated that while some wallets do not have a sign message feature, every taproot compatible wallet has a BIP340 implementation for transaction signing. The point was made that if a wallet supports taproot signing, they already have code to produce BIP340 signatures and message signing for it would be irrelevant if they do not support taproot signing.</p>
