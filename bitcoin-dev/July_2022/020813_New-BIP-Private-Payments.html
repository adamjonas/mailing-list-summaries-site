    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Ruben Somsen provided feedback to Alfred Hodler regarding his proposal for a new BIP that facilitates more private two-party transactions. Ruben pointed out that he had previously mentioned that the proposal introduces a scanning requirement to detect incoming notifications, complicating light client implementation. He recommended that Alfred put this information in the BIP, as it is an important downside that readers should be aware of. Ruben also realized that Alfred's proposal is very similar to the BIP47 protocol improvement suggestions made in Prague, with the only difference being the addition of an extra ECDH calculation to hide the recipient payment code. This causes the downside of having a scanning requirement, with the only benefit being the ability to broadcast notifications oneself instead of outsourcing them. Ruben suggested that this similarity should be acknowledged and that the participants of the Prague discussion should be credited. Ruben also recommended that Alfred take another look at the "Allowing collisions" paragraph from the Prague discussion, as it can potentially shave off up to 28 bytes. Despite this feedback, Ruben expressed support for Alfred's proposal and appreciated the effort put into working out details such as how to handle address formats. Alfred had proposed a new BIP that aims to facilitate more private two-party transactions, which he claimed was a strict improvement upon BIP47, with increased privacy and better future-proofing. The contents of the proposal can be found on GitHub. Alfred hoped to collect feedback and be assigned with a BIP number, with a reference implementation to be published once the BIP is deemed viable.</p>
