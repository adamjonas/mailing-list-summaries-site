    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin development community has raised a question regarding a proposal to reduce the block subsidy after the halving. The member asked whether this approach would prevent people who have not accessed their coins in a long time from being able to move them, potentially constituting theft. They also queried how one could conclusively prove that lost coins are lost forever. In response, Peter Todd clarified that his proposed mathematical proof on coin supply convergence has nothing to do with market dynamics or inflation. Instead, it is based solely on the balance between the fixed rate of coin production and the coin loss rate.</p>
