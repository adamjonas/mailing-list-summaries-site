    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Damian James Williamson questioned the legibility of the blockchain and the fungibility of UTXOs in a proposal. He asked for clarification on which specific part of the proposal affected these issues. KING JAMES HRMH replied, stating that the blockchain must be legible for it to be an indelible record, and that Bitcoin is only fungible because it uses the blockchain. Damian's concerns were marked as "NACK." The email also included contact information for Damian's company, Willtech, as well as links to their website, duigco.org, and other projects. The email ended with a disclaimer stating that it did not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</p>
