        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been updated to allow for arbitrary length tuples, as suggested by Pavol Rusnak. This modification is compatible with the format described in BIP 380 and allows for potential future developments in sub-paths. While there are currently no specific use cases for this change, Pavol believes that future standards may require more sub-paths.Andrew Chow has proposed a BIP called "multipath-descs" to simplify how descriptors for receiving and change addresses are represented by using a single descriptor with a pair of indexes. This modification allows wallets to use the first descriptor for producing receiving addresses and the second descriptor for producing change addresses. The proposal also works for descriptors involving multiple keys. Craig thanked Andrew for this proposal as it simplifies the backup process for wallets.Dmitry Petukhov raised concerns about the use of tuples of length more than two in Bitcoin wallets, arguing that indexes beyond 'receive' and 'change' are not established, which could lead to incompatibilities between different wallet software. Billy Tetrud suggested that defining the conventions of derivation path indexes should be a separate BIP to follow the single responsibility principle. The other party acknowledged their mistake in misreading the BIP proposal text and agreed with Tetrud that there is no need to include such conventions in this BIP.Pavol Rusnak clarified whether triplets can also work or if only tuples of exactly two values are supported. Andrew Chow suggests that a particular method could be generalized to any sized tuples as long as they are all the same length and the limit is one tuple per key expression. Pavol Rusnak agrees with this idea and believes it could be useful for future standards that may introduce more sub-paths. Overall, these proposals aim to simplify and standardize the representation of descriptors for receiving and change addresses while allowing for potential future developments in sub-paths. Feedback is appreciated on the draft BIPs.</p>
