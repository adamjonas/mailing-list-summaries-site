        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list is currently discussing the concept of tail emission and whether it is inflationary. It has been suggested that the rate of coin loss is proportional to the total supply at any given time, leading to an equilibrium when a constant fraction of bitcoins are lost each year. However, losses may not occur at a predictable rate due to unforeseen events or people being careless with smaller amounts. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the rate of loss over time rather than keeping it constant.Peter Todd's proof has been criticized for relying on an unrealistic assumption. If fees do not compensate for low block rewards, Bitcoin will become less inclusive, and only wealthy people will use it. A possible scenario is a 100x drop in network hashrate to catch previous fee levels. Thus, it is essential to ensure that Bitcoin remains sustainable and crosses the Area of Balance naturally by decreasing block rewards and moving from the first edge case to the second one.Removing halving is considered the most honest and simplest way to make every bitcoin passive user participate in keeping the Bitcoin network secure. The reason behind this is that Bitcoin may suddenly be at risk from quantum computers, which could cause the spiral of death. Therefore, it is important to reach common consensus for halvings removal since it is the best evolutionary path. A hard fork may be necessary, but without a solution, Bitcoin will die.Lastly, the author supports Milton Friedman's quote that a balanced system with an annual inflation rate is still better than any surrounding fiat system. This is because the system becomes more inclusive and ensures that everyone can participate, not just the wealthy.</p>
