    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Eric Voskuil emphasized that market production is not the cause of price inflation and that the relationship between the observed lack of inflation and loss is assumed. Peter Todd responded by clarifying that his mathematical proof has nothing to do with observations of inflation, but rather proves that if there is tail emission or fixed supply, the coin's supply will converge towards a fixed amount due to the balance between the coin supply dependant rate of coin loss and the fixed rate of coin production. This proof applies to any system with similar underlying dynamics, regardless of whether it is economic or not.</p>
