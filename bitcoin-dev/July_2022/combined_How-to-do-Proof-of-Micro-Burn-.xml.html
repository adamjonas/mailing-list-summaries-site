        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Veleslav is looking for a solution to the scalability constraint in proof-of-burn use cases, where finite block space poses a challenge. The current working solution is to use OP_RETURN with application-specific data, but this has limitations. Veleslav suggests using a second layer protocol similar to Lightning Network, where micro-burns can be exchanged and public proofs generated instantly. However, he faces the problem of double-spending due to limited block space.Ruben responds to Veleslav's suggestion by proposing a basic merkle sum tree that commits to the intent/recipient of the burn. He also suggests outsourcing the burn to an aggregating third party but warns that it wouldn't be atomic, as the third party could walk away with payment without actually following through with the burn.Ruben believes that performing the burn on a spacechain, a "sidechain" that has burned BTC as its native token, would avoid using mainchain block space altogether, making it more scalable. In a conversation between Ruben and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the concept of commitment in cryptography and explain the merkle sum tree property missing from Ruben's proposal, making "double spending" a burn possible.ZmnSCPxj proposes a method for committing to multiple burns in a single transaction using a basic merkle sum tree, but he warns that outsourcing the burn to an aggregating third party would not be atomic. He suggests an alternative method where the third party uses their private key to aggregate customer scalars and create a sum commitment.In another email exchange, ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about the commitment scheme's atomicity issue and the risk being moved to the seller side. Ruben argues that assuming the opening of the commitment is actually what has value, the buyer has every incentive to actually pay.Ruben also suggests performing the burn on a spacechain, which fully supports SPV proofs, so the third party doesn't have to run a full node. This would avoid using mainchain block space altogether, making it more scalable. Ruben believes that this seems like a possible way to revitalize the original hashcash use case.</p>
