    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the predictability of losses in tail emission. While Peter assumes that there is a rate, it is possible for losses to be at a different predictable rate. However, if there exists any fixed central tendency for the rate, tail emission will eventually become non-inflationary. There are two other factors to consider: firstly, if people improve custody faster than 1/(N(t)*P), tail emission can still be inflationary, although this seems unlikely. Secondly, the rate is somewhat stochastic, with "black swan events" like popular wallet losing keys in coding error being possible but not relevant to tail-emission being non-inflationary. However, even such events can be factored into a fixed central tendency over a long enough time period.</p>
