    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list had discussions about different approaches to smoothing out block rewards and preventing tail supply attacks. One suggested approach is to send 0.01 BTC per block to timelocked outputs, which can be moved endlessly to resist the attack. Another proposal was to burn all fees and keep a block reward that will smooth out while keeping the ~21M coins limit. However, some argue that this goes against Bitcoin values and may lead to monopolization by rich holders who can create cartels. The emission curve and shape of the emission are also important for proper distribution. While Monero has an infinite expected time of emission, it is seen to be worse than Bitcoin due to its huge premine and halving reward. Ethereum's PoS coins like Algorand have the lowest expected emission time, while there's only one coin with an order of magnitude larger expected emission time than Bitcoin, at 50 years.</p>
