        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Michael Folkson has organized an online Socratic discussion on MuSig2 with Tim Ruffing as a guest speaker. The discussion will take place on Thursday, July 28th at 17:00 UTC and will cover the work of Tim and other people who have implemented and researched MuSig2. A reading list has been provided with the hope that some of those people will attend the discussion as well. The format of the discussion will be similar to the Sydney Socratic with Jesse Posner on FROST in March. For those who prefer IRC discussions over video discussions, there is also a biweekly secp256k1 IRC meeting that recently started on the Libera IRC channel #secp256k1. The next meeting is set for Monday, August 1st, 2022 at 15:00 UTC. Although this meeting is not organized by Michael, he thought it might be of interest to a similar group of people. Michael can be contacted via email, Keybase, or PGP. Links to the online Socratic discussion, reading list, and the previous Sydney Socratic are provided in the context.</p>
