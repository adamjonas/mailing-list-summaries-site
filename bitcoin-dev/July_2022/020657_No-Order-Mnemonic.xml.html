    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the challenge of finding a way to encode the BIP39 words in a mnemonic phrase without requiring users to remember the order. A suggestion is made to sort the words alphabetically and then use them as a seed, but this approach raises concerns about security. Another proposal suggests making the list 12 times longer and dividing it into 12 sections, each with 2048 distinct words. The computer would handle the order, and users could neglect it. However, there are concerns about the limited combinations needed to guess the one true ordering even if the words are written down in a 3x4 grid. The possibility of encoding the BIP-39 words for the same key as part of the encoding is also discussed. Nonetheless, the discussion concludes that any ordering is okay as long as the new words are in the same pool as the old words.</p>
