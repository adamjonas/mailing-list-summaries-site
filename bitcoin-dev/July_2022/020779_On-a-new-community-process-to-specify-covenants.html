    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, ZmnSCPxj responds to Antoine's suggestion of claiming Taproot history as a standard methodology in Bitcoin development. ZmnSCPxj argues that Bitcoin development methodology is an open problem and suggests being open-minded enough to examine more agile approaches instead of inventing a multi-decades-lifecycle based methodology. He then discusses the idea of prototyping mechanisms more easily, citing Elements Alpha's approach of creating an entire federated sidechain as a testbed for new mechanisms, which is costly. He also explores an alternative approach of using federated individual coin outpoints. ZmnSCPxj proposes creating a generic contracting platform with a richer language that is used to implement a set of `OP_` SCRIPT opcodes as a way of prototyping new `OP_` codes or changing the behavior of existing ones. He compares the Bitcoin consensus layer to hardware, which can be patched and changed but requires a lot of work and redeployment by everyone, making it practically speaking, hardware. Microcode helps this by adding a softer layer without compromising the existing hard layer.</p>
