    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alicexbt, a member of the Bitcoin Development mailing list wrote to inquire about BGP hijacking attacks on Bitcoin nodes. The vulnerability of bitcoin nodes to BGP hijacking was noted in an answer from 2014. To learn more about the topic, Alicia searched for research articles and found works by Maria Apostolaki et al., Muoi Tran et al., and related works. Alicia also shared links to blog posts about the March 2022 Twitter prefix hijacking incident and the Tor network's vulnerability to BGP hijacking. After conducting some research, Alicia discovered that RPKI ROA and BGP prefix length could help prevent BGP hijacking attacks. Alicia is working on a simple Chrome extension that connects to local bitcoin core and checks the IP address of all peers for prefix length and other attributes. The extension will highlight peers with different colors based on certain criteria. Finally, Alicia asked if anyone had written a detailed blog post or research article like the one by nusenu. If no one has done so, Alicia expressed interest in writing one herself, seeking technical feedback and links to past discussions with potential solutions.</p>
