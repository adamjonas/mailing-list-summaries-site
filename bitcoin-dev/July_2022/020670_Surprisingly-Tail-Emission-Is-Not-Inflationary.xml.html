    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The statement explains that market production does not cause price inflation, and the correlation between non-lost coins and price is assumed. Even if the amount of loss was known, there would still be an assumption in this correlation as demand determines price, not the amount of something in existence. Eric Voskuil claimed that a tail emission/fixed reward leads to a stable money supply due to lost coins, but Peter Todd stated that it was not proof of lost coins and remains an assumption. Todd asked for clarification on whether there was any proof of lost coins or not.</p>
