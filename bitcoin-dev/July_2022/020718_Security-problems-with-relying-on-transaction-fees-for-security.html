    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Peter Todd and an unnamed individual discussed the issue of designing protocols for cryptocurrency with the assumption that prices will always go up. The unnamed individual expressed disappointment at being reduced to someone who believes in "price go up forever" hopium and argued that the price doesn't need such assumptions to make mining rewards appealing. They also highlighted the importance of designing protocols in anticipation of increased adoption, rather than assuming that the world will always remain the same. However, they also made a lighthearted reference to the time difference between Los Angeles and Tokyo, emphasizing the need to consider a global perspective in protocol design.</p>
