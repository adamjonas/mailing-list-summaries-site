    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the definition and examples of capabilities in the context of Bitcoin took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The conversation centered around starting a covenant process from the use-cases themselves and analyzing the trade-offs of any set of contracting primitives or even new Bitcoin fields if they're required building blocks of the use-cases. The range of use-cases for Bitcoin has grown wild, and some proposals include multi-party stateful contracts, congestion trees, payment pools, "eltoo" layered commitments, programmable vaults, multi-event contracts, blockchain-as-oracle bets, spacechains, and trustless collateral lending. One question that arose was whether capabilities are in scope for a covenants proposal, particularly in terms of vaults working better when payments to them are immediately locked up in the vault rather than having to accept them first.</p>
