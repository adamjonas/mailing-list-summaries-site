    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the emission curve of Bitcoin and how it affects the distribution of coins. John Tromp argues that the shape of the emission curve is more important than its duration, as a poorly shaped curve can lead to uneven distribution. He also compares the expected time of emission for various cryptocurrencies and finds that Bitcoin's is about six years, whereas another coin has an expected emission time of 50 years. The original poster suggests burning all fees and keeping a block reward that will smooth out while keeping the ~21M coins limit, which would incentivize miners to collect higher fees transactions and distribute revenues equally over time. However, they do not have ideas yet on how to implement this elegantly. The proposed plan could increase the velocity of money, reduce the immediate supply of Bitcoin, and buffer rewards for miners in the short term.</p>
