    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Prayank is discussing the implementation of a peer-to-peer system that would allow some peers to provide liquidity for others and incentivize participation with small fees. However, there is concern surrounding the trustworthiness of Peer 1, as it is unclear whether they will collude with Peer 3 to steal funds from Peer 2. Additionally, Prayank mentions a technique similar to JoinMarket's PayJoin but notes that having different mixing options makes it harder for spy companies to analyze transactions. They also suggest that a chain of mixers could work better if done correctly. The discussion then shifts to the potential use of multisig for privacy and how Schnorr and Taproot could improve its usage. Finally, ZmnSCPxj provides an article on protocol design for privacy and asks Prayank to clarify their overall goals.</p>
