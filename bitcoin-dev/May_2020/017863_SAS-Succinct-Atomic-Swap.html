    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is discussing the use of private key handover for old-style coinswaps to mitigate potential issues that arise with the traditional four-transaction swap. One concern raised is the possibility of Bob missing the deadline, which would result in Alice reclaiming the funds. Ruben proposes a protocol that involves a shortened refund transaction, which would need to be used before the signed success transaction is given to Bob. However, ZmnSCPxj notes that this proposal still has an issue where Bob can give a copy of the revoke tx with signature directly to its favorite miner, forcing Alice to take three transactions to back out of the swap. This can be mitigated by adding two CPFP outputs and using the minimum relayable feerate for the revoke tx. The conversation also discusses the option of Bob spending before the timelock expires, which seems to be the safest alternative.</p>
