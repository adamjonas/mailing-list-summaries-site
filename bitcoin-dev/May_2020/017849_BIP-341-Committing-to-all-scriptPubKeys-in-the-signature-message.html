    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed a change to the existing BIP341 and BIP342 that would require signatures to commit to every spent scriptPubKey and element of TxOut instead of just the amount. This change would improve the ability of signers to determine whether they can safely sign with only O(1) information per input. The current model is incomplete as in some cases signers may need to be provided with the entire creating transaction, which goes against the proposed PSBT workflows. Wuille supports AJ's approach, which does not increase per-signature hashing while retaining the ability to cache information across BIP141/BIP341. Coinbaseness and height are also being considered but Wuille believes their utility is low. The only downside to this proposal is potentially slowing down review, but Wuille stresses the importance of getting these changes right from the start.</p>
