    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Ruben and ZmnSCPxj discusses the technicalities of conducting a secure and efficient coinswap. Ruben proposes a pre-swap setup that reduces privacy concerns by allowing coins to remain unspent indefinitely. He also acknowledges that the amount analysis issue could be mitigated by Payswap. ZmnSCPxj suggests using relative timelocks and private key handover as an alternative method, which was mentioned as early as 2016 in the Lightning Network paper. The conversation then delves into the specifics of the protocol, such as the potential for Bob to refuse cooperation after Alice puts BTC into lock. They discuss the risks involved and possible mitigation strategies, including using CPFP outputs and minimum relayable feerate. Finally, they agree that the safest alternative is for Bob to spend before the timelock expires and suggest running multiple servers to ensure timely execution of transactions.</p>
