    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the consensus capture argument by miners and the assumptions on topology and deployment in case of an attack scenario. The attack can only succeed if miners' nodes are connected to clients to feed invalid headers, but gateways doing full-node validation would sanitize out the invalid chain. However, multiple connections to these gateways could pose a security risk, making it important to have a wide-enough backbone network and foster node adoption. In response to Antoine Riard's suggestion that LN may attract a lot of adoption without users running a full node, Luke Dashjr opposes merging support for BIP 157 in Core, stating that compromising Bitcoin's security model would harm its future. He highlights the severe regressions in the full node ratio over the past few years and emphasizes that Bitcoin's security relies on the assumption that a supermajority of the economy is verifying their incoming transactions using their own full node. Therefore, all efforts to improve the "full node-less" experience should be avoided, as they provide no real benefits to full node users compared to more efficient protocols like Stratum/Electrum.</p>
