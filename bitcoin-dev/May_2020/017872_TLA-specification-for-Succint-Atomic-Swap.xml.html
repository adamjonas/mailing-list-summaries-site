    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A conversation between Ruben Somsen and Dmitry about the Lightning Network protocol was shared on Thu, 14 May 2020 07:31:13 +0200. They discussed the scenario when Bob gives success_tx to a friendly miner while refund_tx_1 is in the mempool.  Ruben explained that this situation would not be an issue because both Alice and Bob had to misbehave for it to happen. Bob should have published the success_tx before refund_tx_1 became valid, and Alice should have sent the revoke_tx followed by refund_tx_2, revealing her secret only after Bob could no longer claim the BTC. In other words, if either of them does not want it to occur, it won't happen. Dmitry noted that it's crucial that success_tx is confirmed before refund_tx_1 becomes valid, but this is unlikely to be a practical problem since only Bob can spend success_tx unless the original fee of success_tx is too small. Ruben also corrected Dmitry's assumption that Bob will receive BTC, and the LTC can be locked forever. Ruben explained that Alice would not give her key until she learned secretBob, which occurs in step 6 of the diagram. Ruben then made a change in the model, making the `signers_map` into a variable that can be changed to give Bob the ability to sign for Alice. This change enables step 6 to be modeled, but it adds several new transactions to the model.</p>
