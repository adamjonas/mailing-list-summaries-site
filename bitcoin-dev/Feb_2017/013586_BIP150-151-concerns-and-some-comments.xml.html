    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Tuesday, 14 February 2017 22:01:51 CET Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev warned that by using currently available SPV clients, users could reveal their complete wallet content to every network observer between them and the node they have connected to. This means that even while paying for a coffee on a Wi-Fi connection, the coffee owner and all the involved ISPs can correlate the user's wallet with their other internet behavior. Similarly, if cellular data is used, the cellphone provider can also observe this information. In response, a suggestion was made to allow trusted users to connect on a different, encrypted connection, much like the RPC one. It was recommended to use the JSON protocol for this usecase, which essentially involves calling sendRawTransaction. Tom Zander, who made the recommendation, maintains a blog and vlog on his website.</p>
