    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Shaolin Fry, a bitcoin developer, has suggested a new user-driven approach to activate soft forks. He believes that the current methods such as IsSuperMajority and BIP9 have limitations including the need for trust in hash power validation, natural veto power, upgrade inertia, and unnecessary attention on miners. Fry proposes an alternative method called "flag day activation" where nodes begin enforcement of new rules at a predetermined time in the future. This method does not require a supermajority or veto power and provides better incentives for miners to upgrade. His proposal is seen as win-win as it adds an option without detracting from others' enjoyment. Fry expects wide ecosystem collaboration for any deployment strategy, both hashrate or flag day-based.On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a link was shared for p2sh-statistics dashboard with a timestamp range from 1472043312917 to 1488030912918.
