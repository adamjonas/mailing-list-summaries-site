    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, proposed a solution to the problem of the scalability of blockchain transactions on 2/22/17. The proposal involves defining a prunable MMR (Modified Merkle Mountain Range) with a specific grammar and structure. This solution allows for pruning of data that is not needed for validation, which reduces the size of the blockchain and makes it more scalable. The proposal also includes rules for accessing pruned data, which should immediately fail any operation other than checking commitment hashes. Additionally, the proposal provides a method for keeping track of accessed data during operations and proof construction. The soundness of the proofs becomes trivial because it is impossible to construct two different proofs that prove contradictory statements due to the deterministic nature of validation. This solution could help improve the scalability of Bitcoin transactions by reducing the size of the blockchain while maintaining its security and integrity.</p>
