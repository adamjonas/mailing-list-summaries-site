    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list relates to changing the existing rules agreed upon by all. The majority consensus is required for any changes, and this applies to the cap as well. If someone wants to change the 21m cap, nearly everyone would need to agree. Andrew Johnson comments that doing nothing is also a choice. He questions whether one would seriously consider increasing the 21M coin cap if only 10% supported it and 63% were against it. Alp alp argues that 10% is not a tiny minority, but Johnson says that a tiny minority cannot stifle the network forever.In response to Luke Dashjr's comment that the community opposes any block size increase hardfork ever, t. khan disputes that claim based on a poll which shows that 63% of votes want a larger than 1 MB block by that summer. Luke Dashjr responds that full node count is far below the safe minimum of 85% of economic activity and that typically people don't use full nodes themselves due to high resource requirements caused by the block size. T. khan counters that incentivizing full node operation would fix that problem and attempting to solve it by making blocks smaller is like curing a disease by killing the patient.</p>
