    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Luke Dashjr expressed his disagreement with buying "votes" and portraying open standards as a voting process. He also stated that the proposed idea is flawed in design as it depends on address reuse. However, the idea is available right now and can be implemented without any code. The purpose of the CCVS is to reach out to the community and find a compelling solution to the max block size issue. Without significant outreach, Core as a product is dead. Though there are BIP Comments for leaving textual opinions on the BIP unrelated to stake, it does nothing for the community in general, and there is no way to measure that sort of feedback. The email also mentions that there is already enough support for Unlimited to prevent SegWit from ever being adopted.</p>
