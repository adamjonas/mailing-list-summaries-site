    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author supports the idea of having a way for developers to show legitimate consideration for proposals. However, they do not believe an on-chain system is necessary as it complicates things and adds unnecessary code and incentives. The author views Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than approvals, where small technical changes may not need support outside of the developers. Additionally, the author does not think it should cost money or political power to raise an objection and that anyone with a legitimate objection should be able to raise it without barriers. The author agrees that it would be beneficial to have a way to track who considered a proposal and their objections or praises, but without any systemization around passing or failing a proposal and no barrier to entry for providing an opinion.</p>
