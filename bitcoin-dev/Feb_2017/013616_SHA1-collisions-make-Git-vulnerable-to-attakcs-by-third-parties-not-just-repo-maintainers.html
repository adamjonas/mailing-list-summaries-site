    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Aymeric Vitte expressed his thoughts on the difficulty of finding two files with the same hash and how it could render things much more difficult. However, relying on the idea that specific collisions are more difficult to find will not help, and the more files you add to the hash, the more freedom you give the attacker. Although certain collisions may be more difficult to find today, someone will likely prove you wrong in a year. Ignoring security entirely, switching to a new hash function is much simpler than trying to fix the usage of a broken hash function. Relying on SHA1 is deemed hopeless by Tim and must be eliminated.</p>
