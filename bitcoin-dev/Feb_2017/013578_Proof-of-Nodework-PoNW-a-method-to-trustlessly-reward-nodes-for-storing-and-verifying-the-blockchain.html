    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>John Hardy proposed Proof of Nodework (PoNW) to reward individual nodes for keeping a full copy of and verifying the blockchain. A nodeblock is created to administer the system, which is committed to a block as with SegWit. Once a node can see that its addNode transaction has been added it can begin the PoNW process.  The PoNW method could be creating a Merkle tree from the randomly generated point on the blockchain or any CPU/Memory heavy method. During each epoch of say 2016 blocks, there will be an extended window for PoNW transactions to be added to nodeblocks to limit minor censorship. In order to prevent nodes from having multiple keys registered, the share of reward that the node gets will be multiplied based on the number of blocks within an epoch that the node performs PoNW on. At the end of an epoch, with a wait period for any delayed or censored transactions or challenges to be included and settled up, the process of calculating the reward each node is due can begin. Sergio Demian Lerner responded to John's proposal stating RSK platform (a Bitcoin sidechain) is already prepared to do something similar to this, although very efficiently. They set apart 1% of the block reward to automatically reward full nodes. They have two systems being evaluated: the first is based on PoUBS (Proof of Unique Blockchain Storage) which uses asymmetric-time operations to encode the blockchain based on each user public key such that decoding is fast, but encoding is slow. The second is more traditional proof of retrievability, but it requires some ASIC-resistance assumptions. They designed a very cool new type of transaction payload called Ephemeral Payload, to prevent blockchain bloat. The Lumino Network was also built using the same idea (Ephemeral Data).</p>
