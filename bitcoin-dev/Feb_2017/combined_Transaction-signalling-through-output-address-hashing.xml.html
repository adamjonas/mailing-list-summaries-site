        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>John Hardy, through Bitcoin-dev, has proposed a new way to signal support for changes in Bitcoin. Currently, only miners are able to do so, which has been criticized as the rest of the community is not able to participate in consensus. Hardy's proposal suggests using the output address of a transaction to signal support for a particular proposal, inspired by hashcash and vanity addresses. This would involve using the last 4 characters of the output address to signal support for a proposal. Popularity could be measured weighted by fee paid per voting kb, but the system could be easily manipulated by spammers and miners who choose what transactions to include in their blocks. Despite its limitations, it offers an accessible and cost-effective way for the entire economic community to signal their support within transactions. If considered effective, it could also be used to activate changes in the future. However, existing and normal transactions could collide with these schemes, and most wallets have no straightforward way of supporting it. Censorship by miners was also identified as a problem.</p>
