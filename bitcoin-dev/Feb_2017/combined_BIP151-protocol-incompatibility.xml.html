        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list took place regarding the backward compatibility of BIP151, which proposes using otherwise ignored messages for determining optional features. Eric Voskuil challenged the claim that ignoring incoming messages of an unrecognised type was bad, stating that banning peers which send such messages would be detrimental to the network and backwards incompatible with software that does not currently exist.Pieter Wuille countered Voskuil's argument by saying that ignoring unknown messages is not a problem and exchanging otherwise-ignored messages during the version handshake is an explicit part of the protocol negotiation for optional features. Peers that do not support these messages will simply ignore them. Wuille also stated that defining the protocol level requires a strict linear progression of allowed network protocol features.In response to Voskuil's argument that ignoring unknown messages leaves implementations open to DOS attacks, Matt Corallo explained that otherwise-ignored messages are part of the version handshake and protocol negotiation, and peers that do not support them ignore such messages, as if they had indicated they wouldn't support it as per BIP 152's handshake. Corallo also provided links to the implementation of control messages in BIPs to date. He further added that the addition of extra messages that are ignored by old peers does not amount to a lack of backward compatibility. It appears that while there were differing opinions on the backward compatibility of BIP151, the consensus was that otherwise-ignored messages during the version handshake and protocol negotiation were an explicit part of the process, and peers that did not support these messages would simply ignore them.</p>
