    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) is a proposed system for measuring support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) before their implementation. The lack of ability to measure consensus among the Bitcoin community has led to many proposed solutions without clear direction, particularly with controversial changes such as the max block size limit. The CCVS aims to allow the general public, miners, companies using Bitcoin, and developers to vote for their preferred BIP in a way that is public and relatively difficult to manipulate. Under the CCVS system, each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address which is added to each header. Anyone who wants to vote would cast their ballot by sending a small amount (0.0001 btc) to their preferred BIP's address, with each transaction counting as one vote. Mining pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000x a regular vote. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. The proposal acknowledges some unresolved issues, such as the desire for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to also be able to vote with a multiplier (e.g. 100x), but notes that this would require code changes and is outside the scope of this BIP. Some have expressed disagreement with the idea of buying "votes" or portraying open standards as a voting process, noting that it depends on address reuse and is fundamentally flawed in design. However, some suggest that some way for people to express their support weighed by coins (without losing/spending them), and possibly weighed by running a full node, might still be desirable. Note that the BIP process already has BIP Comments for leaving textual opinions on the BIP unrelated to stake.</p>
