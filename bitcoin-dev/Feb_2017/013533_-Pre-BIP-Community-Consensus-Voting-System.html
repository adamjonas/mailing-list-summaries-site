    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) will enable developers to measure support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) before implementation. Each competing BIP would be assigned a unique bitcoin address and anyone who wants to vote would cast their ballot by sending 0.0001 BTC to the preferred BIP's address, with each transaction counting as one vote. While mining pools, companies using Bitcoin and core maintainers/contributors would be allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10k times a regular vote. In addition, someone at the company sends a small transaction to the BIP's vote address and posts what the vote was and its transaction ID on the company's blog/twitter, etc., and then emails the URL to the administrator. The confirmed votes would then be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. However, there are many unanswered questions including deciding eligibility of businesses and websites, and how to verify voters, so this proposal is far from complete.</p>
