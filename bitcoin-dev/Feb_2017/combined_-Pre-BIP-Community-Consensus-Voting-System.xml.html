        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new proposal called the Community Constrained Votes System (CCVS) has been introduced to measure support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). This system would allow miners, companies, and core maintainers/contributors to vote once on each BIP. Their confirmed votes would be worth 10,000 times more than a regular vote, ensuring fair voting by negating the effect of anyone trying to skew results by repeatedly voting.The CCVS proposes a way for developers to measure support for BIPs before implementing them and will provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. However, some people believe that an on-chain system adds complexity and incentives, and they prefer Bitcoin as a system of vetos rather than approvals. They also don't think it should cost money or political power to raise an objection, as this could shut down important opinions. Some prefer to have an easier way to figure out who had considered a proposal and what their objections or praises were, while others believe that there should be no barrier to entry to provide an opinion. The issue of node voting has not been resolved yet, but it would be desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier, such as 100x, although this is currently outside the scope of this BIP.The CCVS aims to provide a fair and democratic way of measuring support for proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol. While it may help in measuring support for BIPs, it is still up for debate whether an on-chain system makes sense and whether it is necessary to have a formalized process for passing or failing proposals.</p>
