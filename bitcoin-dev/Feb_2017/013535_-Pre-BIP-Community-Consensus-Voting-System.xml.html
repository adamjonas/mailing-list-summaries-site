    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about determining which companies or developers should have a confirmed vote in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. The decision-making process for this involves determining what kind of company counts and which websites are checked for votes or addresses. The goal is to gauge community support, so the less centralized decision making there is, the better. Rogue employees would be the responsibility of the company in question. Registering domain names can be automated if incentives were needed for it. If a domain name is registered after voting is called, that would indicate it's a fake company. Developers with commit access won't have a confirmed vote, but they would get a standard vote like everyone else.</p>
