    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Tom via bitcoin-dev, the issue of serializing transactions in a certain order was discussed. According to Tom, if the order of tokens is not fixed, it could lead to multiple interpretations of data which is not allowed. However, Peter Todd countered that fixed token orders are redundant information and suggested using a "Some/None" flag to mark whether optional data has been omitted. This suggestion was already addressed in the spec which uses a generic concept where each field is given a name, allowing for new fields to be added or optional fields to be omitted from individual transactions. Peter Todd further suggested using a format that extends the merkle tree down into the transaction inputs and outputs, but did not provide any argument to support his position.</p>
