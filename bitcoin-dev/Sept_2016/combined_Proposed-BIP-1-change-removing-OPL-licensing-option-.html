        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made to revise BIP-1, which would remove the option of licensing work under the Open Patent License (OPL). The OPL contains clauses that allow the licensor to restrict print publication and creation of modified versions without their approval. Additionally, the attribution requirements of this license are considered too restrictive by Debian. Only two BIPs have used the OPL, and it is significantly more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license. This is a concern for documentation that cannot be shipped with the code. In a bitcoin-dev email thread on September 26th, 2016, Peter Todd expressed his worries about the OPL being more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license. He noted that documentation and code can have different licenses, and shipping documentation under a separate license is common practice. His suggestion was made in response to Luke's BIP2 revival proposal, which offered a more formal solution. He suggested that Luke's proposal be considered instead. Lastly, Peter mentioned that he had dual-licensed his BIP in preparation for its acceptance. It is now available under both the original license and a Creative Commons license.The author of the proposal believes that the OPL is incompatible with having a transparent, public, and collaborative process for developing standards for interoperability. The project that created this license has recommended the use of creative commons licenses instead since 2007. The proposal suggests adding a permissive 2-clause BSD license as an option, which would not activate the problematic clauses. It is unclear whether anyone involved in the project was aware of these clauses at the time of their inclusion. In the same email thread, Tom responded to Peter's concerns by saying that different licenses for documentation and code are common and there's no need to worry about being unable to ship documentation with code. However, Peter clarified that the issue lies in the OPL being significantly more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license, not just that the licenses are different. The conversation also touched on the importance of dual-licensing documentation with a code-oriented license if it includes example code. Lastly, Tom suggested Luke's BIP2 revival as a formal solution and announced his own BIP is now dual-licensed under the Creative Commons license. Peter thanked him and said that CC-BY-SA is a good license for that purpose.</p>
