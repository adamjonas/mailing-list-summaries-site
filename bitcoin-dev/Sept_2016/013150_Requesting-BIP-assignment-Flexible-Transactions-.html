    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, there was a conversation regarding a proposal to use the 'Coin Movement Formats' for transactions in Bitcoin Classic. Christian Decker expressed his view that BIPs should be self-contained, and referencing external formatting documents should be avoided. Tom responded saying he would submit CMF as a BIP if required, to which Luke stated he had no preference. Christian also pointed out a few minor issues with the table and clarified the definition of 'third-party malleability.' There was a discussion about the dependencies of tokens inside a segment, which led to the conclusion that it wasn't anything complicated or worrying. Finally, there was a debate about allowing miners to reject transactions with unknown fields, potentially making OP_NOPs unusable. The problem of rejecting such transactions could result in a hard-fork.</p>
