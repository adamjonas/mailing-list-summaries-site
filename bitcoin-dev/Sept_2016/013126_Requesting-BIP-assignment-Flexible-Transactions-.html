    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom has requested for the assignment of a BIP number for his FT spec. He has been asked to open a pull request on the bitcoin/bips repo after this has been discussed a bit on the ML. The proposal requires at least a basic backwards compatibility section, especially since it appears to be a hard-fork proposal. Token-based file formats are not new and there is already a binary-safe format called EBML. This protocol upgrade will re-order the data-fields which allows fixing of the malleability issue. The last byte in the txid calculation, or the last byte of the entire transaction has been questioned. The replacement for SIGHASH_SINGLE and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY has also been questioned. The tokens defined above have to be serialized in a certain order for the transaction to be well-formatted. The ScriptVersion token is currently not allowed because there is no valid value to give it. The merkle tree is extended to include (append) the hash of the v4 transactions (and those alone). There is a question about how should nodes know where in the merkle-tree the txids end and the v4hashes begin.</p>
