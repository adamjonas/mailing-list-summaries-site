    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to remove the option to license work under the OPL has been made in a revision to BIP-1. The OPL contains terms where the licensor can elect to prohibit print publication of the work, as well as the creation of modified versions without their approval. The specific construction of these licenses' attribution requirements are restrictive enough that Debian does not consider it acceptable for works included in their distribution. The only BIPs that have availed themselves of the OPL are BIP145 and the recently assigned BIP134. It is noted that the OPL is significantly more restrictive than the Bitcoin Core license, which is not good if documentation cannot be shipped with the code.</p>
