    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to revise BIP-1 has been made, which removes the option of licensing work under OPL. The OPL contains clauses that allow the licensor to restrict print publication and creation of modified versions without their approval. In addition, the attribution requirements of this license are considered too restrictive by Debian. The project that created this license has recommended the use of creative commons licenses instead since 2007. Only two BIPs have used the OPL, one of which is dual licensed under a permissive 2-clause BSD license. The proposal suggests adding this as an option, which would not activate the problematic clauses. It is not clear whether anyone involved in the project was aware of these clauses at the time of their inclusion. The author believes that the OPL is incompatible with having a transparent, public and collaborative process for developing standards for interoperability.</p>
