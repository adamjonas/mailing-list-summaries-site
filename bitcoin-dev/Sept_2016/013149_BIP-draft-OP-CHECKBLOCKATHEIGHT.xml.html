    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This BIP proposes a new opcode, known as OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT, for the Bitcoin scripting system. The purpose of this opcode is to address the issue of reissuing bitcoin transactions when the coins they spend have been conflicted or double-spent. The full details of this proposal can be found on the Github page provided in the context.The proposal has been put forward by Luke-Jr, who is seeking feedback on whether this is a good idea or approach. As of now, it is unclear whether this proposal will be accepted and implemented by the Bitcoin community. However, the proposed opcode could potentially provide a solution to the problem of double-spending that has plagued the Bitcoin network in the past.Overall, this BIP presents an interesting and innovative approach to addressing the issue of double-spending in the Bitcoin network. While it remains to be seen whether the proposal will be accepted and implemented, it is certainly worth considering as a potential solution to this long-standing problem.</p>
