    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 22, 2016, Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev initiated a discussion with Tom about tagged systems. Tom had misunderstood the concept of tagged systems at a basic level and likened it to HTML only being able to use a bold tag once in a document. Jonas asked if the additional segment would contain the same amount of nSequence-equivalent token as the number of inputs in the inputs segment. However, he was not sure what it should look like as he had not deeply looked into BIP68. Spending limitations were expected to be assigned to an output rather than an input. Jonas suggested that this should be mentioned or specified in the BIP and acknowledged that the BIP was not yet finished. He welcomed all discussions about it as they would make the end result stronger.</p>
