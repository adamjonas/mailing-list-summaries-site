    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, Eric Voskuil argued that there is no need for conditionally hiding a feature as it provides no security benefit. He stated that any peer who wants the feature can access it, and obfuscation is weak security. Jeremy disagreed with Eric's interpretation of "security" and suggested disabling the feature if one does not want to expose it. However, he also noted that the functionality might not be buggy but may just not support peers who do not support another feature. Overall, the discussion centered around the complexity of protocols in relation to security and privacy concerns.</p>
