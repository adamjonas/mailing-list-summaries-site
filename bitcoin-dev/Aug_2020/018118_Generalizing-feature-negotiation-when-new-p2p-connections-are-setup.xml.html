    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Suhas Daftuar proposed codifying the idea that Bitcoin network clients should ignore unknown messages received before a VERACK. In response to this proposal, Anthony Towns suggested having a specific feature negotiation message that is valid only between VERSION and VERACK. This feature negotiation message takes a length-prefixed-string giving the feature name, optional additional data, and if the feature name isn't recognised the message is ignored. Matt added that using the same namespace for negotiation seems fine as well and concluded that it doesn't matter in the slightest which message for negotiation is used. Matt also noted that if one person volunteers to write a BIP and code, they should just decide and be allowed to run with it. The principle of rough consensus and running code applies here.</p>
