    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about backward compatibility, the question of what constitutes the existing Bitcoin protocol is raised. While there is confusion over this, it is noted that the protocol does not require a peer to accept arbitrary messages. The discussion then turns to the need for negotiation to allow different software to negotiate different features without a global lock-step version number increase. While some argue for a single message that lists the set of features which a node wishes to support on the connection, others propose extending the verack with a matrix of feature support. There is agreement that the current method of protocol version bumping isn't scalable and something more flexible is needed. However, there is debate over whether a single message or multiple messages are preferable for feature negotiation. It is proposed that a simpler system can be created by eliminating extra messages and using the existing numeric version to signal an extension to the verack, which can then carry a list of optional sub-protocols for final negotiation. The format of the matrix is discussed, with some suggesting using hashes instead of human-readable names to avoid collisions. However, it is noted that human-readable names have shown to be relatively non-colliding in past Bitcoin protocol changes. Overall, the goal is to reduce communication complexity and allow peers to lock in allowed message semantics by the end of the handshake.</p>
