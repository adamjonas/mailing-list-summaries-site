        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille has proposed changing the tiebreaker rule for conveying the Y coordinate of points in BIP340 draft. Currently, squaredness is used as the tiebreaker for the R point inside signatures while evenness is used for public keys. Recent developments have shown that using evenness as the tiebreaker may be faster and more efficient than squaredness. The change is relatively simple to implement and involves modifying the BIP, proposed implementation, test vectors, and other draft implementations.While some changes are required in the BIP, libsecp256k1, and Bitcoin Core, Wuille believes that this change would be beneficial and worth considering, despite being late in the process. Nadav, a maintainer of Bitcoin-S and secp256k1 bindings, expressed his support for the change as it will have a slight positive impact on verification speed and a larger positive impact on signing speed. John Newbery via bitcoin-dev suggested changing the proposal and implementation to use even tie-breakers everywhere, which was unanimously supported by others. This change reduces the mental overhead needed for explaining design decisions as the entire optimization section from the BIP can be removed.Additionally, Pieter Wuille has also proposed changing the tiebreaker rule for block validation to resolve a long-standing issue where blocks with an odd number of transactions have a higher chance of being orphaned in the network due to a tiebreaker rule that prioritizes the block with the lowest hash. The proposed change is to prioritize the block with the even number of transactions. Following positive responses, Wuille has created a patch to implement the change and plans to submit it to the BIPs repository if there are no further arguments against it.Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed changing the tiebreaker rule for conveying the Y coordinate of points in BIP340.
