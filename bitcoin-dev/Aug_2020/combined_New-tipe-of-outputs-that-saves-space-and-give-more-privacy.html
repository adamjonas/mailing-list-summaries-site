        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jule.Adka has proposed a new approach to address scalability and privacy issues associated with Bitcoin transactions. The proposal involves the use of Mekelized Output Set and the p2mos (pay to Mekelized Output Set) standard, which only specifies a Markle root instead of listing all the output set. This reduces the amount of data created through transactions and solves scalability problems. Additionally, this approach solves privacy issues by keeping information about the outputs private until they are spent. The proposal saves space in blocks and makes transactions smaller, decreasing the data used for SPV nodes. However, it requires more coordination between wallets and extra bandwidth for downloading the witness data. Retro compatibility is possible but requires implementation as a soft-fork. This approach involves only specifying a Markle root instead of listing all the output set, reducing the amount of data created through transactions and solving scalability problems. Peers are the only ones who know the number and value of the outputs. The proposal also solves various privacy problems associated with outputs, like Equal-output CoinJoin and different outputs types.An opcode may be needed to make reference to p2mos, instructing the node to look at the witness data to find the actual output. The amount is preserved for compatibility as well for calculating mining fees, once the miner has no idea of the actual value locked into the output. The fee calculus doesn't change. Using the p2mos, one keeps private the information about the outputs until it has been spent, saving space into the block and making the transactions (without taking into account the witness data) smaller, decreasing the data used for SPV nodes. However, implementing this approach as a soft-fork is the main problem. Old nodes that don’t follow the new consensus rule can accept this kind of transaction if it’s made as anyone can spend in the current consensus, but at a second spend, the node will interpret it as a double spend, hence invalidating it. The proposal requires more coordination between wallets, is a bit harder to compute for a validator and would require some extra bandwidth for downloading the witness data.</p>
