    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Hartman proposed adding an opcode that would allow binary options on difficulty. However, another member argued that any kind of opcode is already a binary option as the output can either be spent or not. Instead, they suggested creating a pseudo-continuous future by having lots of outputs with different thresholds. Alice and Bob can create a transaction with 100 outputs and each having 1% of the future's value, where each output will pay Alice or Bob if the difficulty meets their threshold. This method isn't very efficient, but Taproot MAST can improve it. By generating N fresh keypairs and tapleaf scripts, Alice and Bob can agree on the number of ticks and payout schedule, and execute them efficiently.</p>
