    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 was designed to describe a data structure and the abstract workflow around it, not how hardware wallets should behave. This means that secure storage/use/setup of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) has been considered out of scope for BIP 174. Nicolas Dorier had raised concerns about global xpub field discussions a year ago, and since then, Electrum Wallet developers and Sjors Provoost have discussed how to coordinate multisig wallets and represent cosigners securely. The topics included what cosigners need, working with Musig, Lightning, Taproot, Native Descriptor Wallets, authenticating across devices, ensuring PSBTs haven't been changed en route, and defending against change attacks. Jonathan Underwood's PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB_SIGNATURE addition to BIP174 addresses some of these concerns; however, it is not a finalized BIP yet, and the global xpub field is not pulled into Core yet. Therefore, Robert Spigler suggests expanding or creating a new, more descriptive BIP on how to securely use PSBTs. This idea becomes more important as Core has been merging more PRs on the work around offline/multisig use. Glenn Willen and Luke Dashjr thought this was a good idea, with Luke offering a Bitcoin Wiki page for the short term. However, this was a few months ago, and Robert Spigler thought he would open this idea to the general community.</p>
