        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 was created to describe a data structure and the abstract workflow around it, not how hardware wallets should behave. The secure storage/use/setup of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) has been considered out of scope for BIP 174. Nicolas Dorier raised concerns about global xpub field discussions a year ago, which led to Electrum Wallet developers and Sjors Provoost discussing how to coordinate multisig wallets and represent cosigners securely.The topics discussed included working with Musig, Lightning, Taproot, Native Descriptor Wallets, authenticating across devices, ensuring PSBTs haven't been changed en route, and defending against change attacks. While Jonathan Underwood's PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB_SIGNATURE addition to BIP174 addresses some of these concerns, it is not a finalized BIP yet and the global xpub field is not pulled into Core yet.Therefore, Robert Spigler suggests expanding or creating a new, more descriptive BIP on how to securely use PSBTs. As Core has been merging more PRs on the work around offline/multisig use, this idea becomes increasingly important. Glenn Willen and Luke Dashjr support the idea, with Luke offering a Bitcoin Wiki page for the short term. However, this proposal was made a few months ago, and Robert Spigler thought it would be best to open this idea to the general community.</p>
