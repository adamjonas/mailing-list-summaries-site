        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new opcode has been proposed in a BIP that can enable transactions to be around 37% smaller than traditional single-source segwit transactions. This is an important pursuit for Inclusive Accountability as it leads to improved frugality in two ways. Firstly, more transactions can be confirmed in a block, and secondly, small value inputs that were previously inaccessible can now be referenced without losing unrecoverable value due to transaction overhead. The BIP can be found on GitHub.ZmnSCPxj addressed the issue of SCRIPT re-evaluation and reorgs in an email exchange, explaining that reorgs cause more processing to be done by nodes, even with the use of Floating-point Nakamoto Consensus. This increases the processing load on validating fullnodes and prevents pruning from working. Miners can still mount a DoS on validating fullnodes with `OP_PUBREF` and Floating-Point Nakamoto Consensus by re-mining the same block and broadcasting a block if it has a higher score than the previous chain tip, which locks the blockchain and increases the load on fullnodes. ZmnSCPxj also responded to Michael's proposal of solving re-orgs in a different way by suggesting "Hard NAK." They pointed out issues with Michael's proposal such as encouraging address reuse, hurting fungibility and privacy; preventing pruning; requiring the creation of another index to previous block data, increasing requirements on fullnodes; and needing SCRIPT to be re-evaluated on transactions arriving in new blocks. ZmnSCPxj noted that none of these issues were addressed in Michael's proposal and that it only looked at clients without considering validators.ZmnSCPxj also pointed out several important issues with the proposal of a new opcode called Hard NAK, including hurting fungibility and privacy by encouraging address reuse, preventing pruning, requiring the creation of another index to previous block data which increases requirements on fullnodes, and needing SCRIPT to be re-evaluated on transactions arriving in new blocks to protect against reorgs of the chaintip. ZmnSCPxj notes that none of these issues have been addressed in the current proposal and it looks only at clients without considering what validators will need to implement to validate new blocks with this opcode.The email thread includes an HTML attachment and a non-text attachment titled "Floating-Point Nakamoto Consensus.pdf" which may contain further information related to the discussion. On the Ethereum side, the variant of this technology is Ditto Transactions, which can be found on Ethereum Magicians forum.</p>
