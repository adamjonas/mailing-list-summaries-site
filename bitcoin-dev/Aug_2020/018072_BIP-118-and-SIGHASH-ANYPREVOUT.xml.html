    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent Bitcoin development email thread, a member suggested that it would be ideal if it were trivial to relay a transaction to a full node without knowing exactly which input transaction that node has in its mempool/active chain. This is a complex problem both in p2p protocol complexity and mempool optimization, but it may leave SIGHASH_NOINPUT rather useless for lighting without it. The consensus design should be thought about in this context, even if an external overlay relay network needs to be provided in order to make lighting transactions relay properly with miners running such software. In another email thread, Anthony Towns opened a draft pull request to update BIP 118 with the ANYPREVOUT bip. The new BIP text is available on Github and includes significant changes since previous discussion, including the complete lack of chaperone signatures or anything like it, and that ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT no longer commits to the value.</p>
