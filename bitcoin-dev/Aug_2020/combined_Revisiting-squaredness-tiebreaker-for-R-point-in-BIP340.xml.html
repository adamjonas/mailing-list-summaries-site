        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposed BIP340 implementation uses two different tiebreakers for conveying the Y coordinate of points. Squaredness is used for the R point inside signatures while evenness is used for public keys. Initially, both had used squaredness, but it was later changed to evenness for public keys as it resulted in additional complexity for compatibility with existing systems.The reason behind choosing squaredness as a tiebreaker was performance, but recent developments show that computing evenness requires converting points to affine coordinates first and that needs a modular inverse. In some cases, using inverses can be faster than Jacobi symbols. Bitcoin Core developer, Pieter Wuille, has proposed a change to the BIP340 implementation by replacing squaredness tiebreakers with evenness tiebreakers. This proposal comes after realizing that squaredness may not be an optimal choice due to a misunderstanding. Pieter believes that this change will significantly reduce the mental overhead needed for explaining design decisions. The specific changes include changing both invocations of 'has_square_y' to 'has_even_y', changing the 'lift_x_square_y' invocation to 'lift_x_even_y', applying the same change to the test vector generation code and test vectors, and duplicating these changes in other draft implementations that may already exist. It is difficult to make very generic statements about the future performance of BIP340 since it may be used for a long time, and hardware advancements and algorithmic improvements may change the balance. For block validation in Bitcoin Core, the numbers for master-nogmp are probably most relevant as Bitcoin Core uses libsecp256k1 without libgmp to reduce consensus-critical dependencies. If/when gets merged, safegcd-nogmp will be what matters, and on a longer time scale, the gmp numbers may be more relevant as the Jacobi implementation speeds up with larger inputs.</p>
