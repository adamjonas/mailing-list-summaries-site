    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo discussed the possibility of a relay network that could handle transactions with SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. Such a network would need to be able to rewrite transactions before passing them on to a local bitcoind. For example, a sender could relay a transaction with one input that is valid for any output index 0 in a transaction spending output B. The receiver would then look up which transaction in its mempool or chain spends output B and fill in the input with that outpoint. Richard Myers asked if such a relay network could be more "smart about replacement" in the context of ANYPREVOUT by RBF-ing parts of a package. Matt responded that SIGHASH_NOINPUT would make these issues much simpler to address, but only if nodes could be "smart" about replacement when they see a SIGHASH_NOINPUT spend that can spend an output already spent by something else in the mempool. While shoving this complexity into the Bitcoin P2P network may not be feasible, a relay network of lightning nodes could potentially handle the calculation and pass the transactions to their local full nodes.</p>
