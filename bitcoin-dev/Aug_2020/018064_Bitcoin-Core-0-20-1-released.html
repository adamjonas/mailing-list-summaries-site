    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.20.1 has been released, and it includes various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. Users can download the updated version from the Bitcoin Core website or via BitTorrent. If users are running an older version, they should shut it down completely before upgrading to the latest version. Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported. The update is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer. The release notes indicate that peers that misbehave (e.g., sending invalid blocks) are now referred to as discouraged nodes in log output. Additionally, there are a few changes introduced to how discouraged addresses are treated: discouragement does not time out automatically after 24 hours, discouragement is not persisted over restarts, and there is no method to list discouraged addresses. Wallet notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are removed from the mempool because they conflict with a new block. Notable changes include that PSBTs will contain both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit inputs to restore compatibility with wallet software that requires the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. There have also been several changes made to mining, P2P protocol and network code, wallet, RPC and other APIs, GUI, build system, and tests and QA. The release includes credits to everyone who directly contributed to this release, as well as those who helped with translations on Transifex.</p>
