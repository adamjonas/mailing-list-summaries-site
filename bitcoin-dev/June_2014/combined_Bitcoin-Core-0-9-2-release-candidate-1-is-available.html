        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2rc1 has been released, offering bug fixes and minor improvements. Users can download the release from the Bitcoin website. The update includes new translations from Transifex, and appreciation is expressed for those who contributed translations.This latest release, 0.9.2rc1, features bug fixes and minor enhancements. It is important to note that release candidates are intended for extensive testing, so non-technical users may prefer to wait for the final version, 0.9.2, before upgrading or downgrading. It's worth mentioning that the 'chainstate' in this release may not always be compatible with previous versions.There are a few notable changes in this release. First, the deterministic build system, previously used for Windows and Linux builds, is now also employed for OSX builds. While the resulting executables have undergone significant testing, there is still a possibility of regressions. In addition, this version of Bitcoin Core for Linux is built against Qt 4.6 and filters symbols for libstdc++ and glibc.The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface has received some updates as well. New calls such as `getwalletinfo`, `getblockchaininfo`, and `getnetworkinfo` have been added, replacing the older and less organized `getinfo` call. Command-line options have been fixed to properly output `-printblocktree` and display an error message if ReadConfigFile fails.Improvements have been made to the block-chain handling and storage, including an upgrade of leveldb to version 1.17. The protocol and network code now feature per-peer block download tracking and stalled download detection, as well as a new DNS seed from bitnodes.io.The wallet functionality has also been enhanced. The GetAvailableCredit function now only runs GetHash() once per transaction, improving performance. Additionally, the paytxfee warning threshold has been lowered from 0.25 BTC to 0.01 BTC, and the BerkeleyDB version is now logged at startup.Several changes have been made to the build system. OSX build descriptors have been added to gitian, a tool for creating secure deterministic builds. Furthermore, the miniupnpc version has been upgraded to 1.9.Miscellaneous changes include replacing non-threadsafe C functions (such as gmtime, strerror, and setlocale), adding missing cs_main and wallet locks, avoiding exceptions at startup when the system locale is not recognized, and modifying bitrpc.py's raw_input to getpass for password input, concealing characters during command line input.The Bitcoin Core team expresses gratitude to all those who contributed to this release.</p>
