        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context describes a potential attack on Bitcoin transactions in which an unconfirmed transaction is saved by the receiver for a few days and then relayed back to the network or mined using their own hash power. The attacker can store the unconfirmed transaction sent by the payer and later relay it to the network or mine it directly with their own hash power, taking possession of the bitcoins without the knowledge of the payer. This attack can also work with the Payment Protocol, according to the context.The attack was proposed by Raúl Martínez, who suggested that some transactions fail to confirm and are eventually purged by Bitcoin nodes due to a lack of fees. In this scenario, Alice is selling a pizza to Bob, who pays with Bitcoin. The goal of the attack is for Alice to store the unconfirmed transaction sent by Bob for a few days, which will not be included in the blockchain due to no fee or other reasons. After a couple of days, Alice relays the transaction to the network or mines it directly with her own hash power. Bob does not know what happened, and Alice now has the bitcoins.It is unclear if there is a fix for this problem, and it is uncertain if this type of attack is possible. The Payment Protocol does not prevent the attack because when using it, Bob does not relay the transaction to the network. However, Toshi Morita noted that Alice cannot intercept the transaction and prevent the rest of the network from seeing it.To avoid simultaneous confirmation of both, it is recommended to reuse one of the inputs when reissuing a transaction that did not go through earlier. Reusing inputs is important when resending a transaction, and creating a new transaction without doing so would mean spending twice as much money. Once a signed transaction leaves the system, there is no way to undo it. Even if the transaction has low fees or is nonstandard, any UI which suggests a "cancel" feature that is not based on respending inputs is dangerously broken.</p>
