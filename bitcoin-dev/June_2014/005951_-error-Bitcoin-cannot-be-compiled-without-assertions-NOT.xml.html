    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Ron, it was revealed that Ron's email was being spamfoldered due to Yahoo's DMARC policy and the brokenness of the SF.net mailing list software. Mike suggested that they move away from SF.net for hosting mailing lists since it's the list that's at fault not Yahoo. Ron had a question about assert() having side effects and provided a link to a book on the subject. Mike explained that professional codebases often require assertions be enabled and that Bitcoin Core currently will fail to build if assertions are disabled. In response, Ron stated that they do not use assertions with side effects and explained that in an abundance of caution they made it refuse to compile without assertions enabled. He also stated that considering the normal criticality of the software, it should always be with the assertions. Without them is an untested configuration.</p>
