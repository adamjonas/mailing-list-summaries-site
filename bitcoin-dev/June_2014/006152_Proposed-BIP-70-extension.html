    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Andy Alness, a software engineer at Coinbase has given his opinion on the idea of letting consumers know advanced details about transactions. He agrees with Will (and also with Mike, Jeff, and Charlie) that the idea is good. However, he suggests that an arbitrary set of accounting line items would be more palatable. These line items could be for state sales tax, cash back rewards, or merchant discounts. Alness suggests that it would be a list of amount/label tuples.In response to this, someone on the mailing list questions why this cosmetic field in particular is being supported. They suggest that if one random cosmetic field is supported, then they might as well support them all with a generic structured data format. They argue that the textual memo field is already sufficient and that they should try to keep as much cruft as possible out of the payment protocol.Jeff Garzik responds by stating that there is nothing wrong with having a numeric memo field which is effectively what this is. It is structured rather than unstructured data.</p>
