    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Chris Pacia expressed his disapproval of a proposed scheme in which a payment system requires users to have double the funds they need to make a purchase, calling it an "ugly hack." He argues that not everyone will have the extra funds available, making it inconvenient for them to use the payment system. In response, it was noted that the scheme would not be mandatory and users could still opt to wait for confirmations or rely on existing trust. The idea of reserving a higher amount to cover risks is not new, as seen in hotel or car rental payments. The question arises whether it is important for a payment system to allow users to quickly spend their last penny.</p>
