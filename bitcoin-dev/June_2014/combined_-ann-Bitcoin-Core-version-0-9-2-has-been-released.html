        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Wladimir reported an issue on June 17, 2014, while running bitcoin-qt under Ubuntu 10.04. He received a "symbol lookup error" that indicated an undefined symbol "_ZN10QTextCodec11validCodecsEv". In response, Jesus asked if the issue occurred with the release candidate.According to Wladimir's message on the same day at 11:46, they had built against Qt 4.6 for Linux and filtered the symbols for libstdc++ and glibc to ensure compatibility with Debian 6+, Tails, Ubuntu 10.04, and CentOS 6.5. However, Jesús Cea Avión encountered an error when trying to run bitcoin-qt in the /tmp/bitcoin-0.9.2-linux/bin/64 directory. The error was related to an undefined symbol: _ZN10QTextCodec11validCodecsEv.Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2 has been released, featuring the latest version of OpenSSL that addresses a recently-discovered security flaw. This minor release also includes various bug fixes and improvements. It is highly recommended to upgrade, particularly as it restores compatibility with older Linux distributions such as Debian 6+, Tails, Ubuntu 10.04, and CentOS 6.5.The release notes highlight significant changes, including per-peer block download tracking, detection of stalled downloads, lowering of the paytxfee warning threshold from 0.25 BTC to 0.01 BTC, and fixes for coin control visual issues. Additionally, the deterministic build system previously used for Windows and Linux builds is now available for OSX as well. Users are encouraged to report any potential regressions on Github.</p>
