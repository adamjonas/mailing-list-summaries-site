    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of losing nodes over time in the Bitcoin network has been identified by Mike H. and discussed in a coindesk article from May 9, 2014. A proposed solution to reduce node loss is mentioned in an issue on Github related to Bitcoin Core. The solution involves a feature that would incentivize individuals to run full nodes and donate through a "decentralizing lottery." Participants who are running nodes and donating, regardless of how infrequently or to whom they donate, would be entered into the lottery. Award amounts would vary depending on the number of participants and would be distinct from block rewards for mining. This concept complements the current block reward system for miners and provides an opportunity for non-miners to be compensated for their efforts in the system. The hope is that this will spur additional development discussion on incentivizing giving and may involve a process BIP.</p>
