        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2014, Odinn Cyberguerrilla proposed a solution to incentivize more people to run full nodes and participate in Bitcoin Core development. The proposal was to create a feature that would process small change and tiny transaction outputs to user-specified donation targets in an incentivized process. The purpose of this proposal was to address the issue of how to incentivize more interested individuals to run full nodes and reduce the loss of nodes over time.The proposed solution involves every node competing with its peers in terms of relevancy, established by delivering newly-seen transactions first. Once any given pair of nodes can establish who, if anyone, should be paying, they could use micropayment channels to handle payments. The market for the service of delivering transaction information would be established, and price signals would properly match supply and demand. However, concerns have been raised about potential perverse incentives that may arise from paying for goods and services with Bitcoin through individual transactions rather than consolidated ones.There is also concern about a proposal that would incentivize nodes to process transactions based on the number of inputs or total kilobytes used, as this could lead to a network split between capitalist nodes that charge their peers and socialist nodes that expect their peers to submit transactions out of goodwill. To address these concerns, the proposal suggests a design that ensures the voluntary nature of donations, including pay-to-play networks and not just free P2P networks.Mixed-mode nodes could be operated with a fraction of the allowed incoming connections reserved for free peers. Free connections might be limited in terms of time duration. Bitcoin-accepting brick-and-mortars would probably allow free access to anyone connected to their internal wifi to facilitate people wanting to pay. Crowdfunded free bridges, assurance contracts, etc. are all other ways to let people get into the network with no upfront cost.The discussion also mentions a proposal to incentivize individuals to run full nodes through a "decentralizing lottery" that complements the current block reward system for miners. The proposed solution involves limiting the number of entries in the proposed 'decentralizing lottery' to one entry per distinct period of time, for anyone who meets the suggested criteria of running full nodes (Bitcoin Core), processing their change and txouts through Core. Those who donate will be entered into the 'decentralizing lottery', where they can win small to large bitcoin amounts, depending on how many participants are involved in the donations process.Overall, the goal is to incentivize more people to participate in running full nodes and donating to the Bitcoin Core development while maintaining a decentralized and secure network. It is important to limit the number of "lottery tickets" any given individual can acquire without a resource-limiting factor, and to address concerns about potential network splits between capitalist and socialist nodes. Justus Ranvier suggested that multiple transport networks for Bitcoin already exist, and that as long as multihomed hosts act as bridges, information will propagate across all of them.</p>
