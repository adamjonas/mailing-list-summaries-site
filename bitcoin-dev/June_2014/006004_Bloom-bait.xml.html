    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik, they discuss the potential impact of privacy-focused bloom filters on the Bitcoin network. Mike argues that sending different bloom filters to different peers for privacy reasons would create an O(n) cost per query, which would greatly increase the load on the network and appear like a DoS attack. He suggests that prefix filtering might be a better approach, but Jeff counters that it still creates pagecache pressure and disk activity issues. They both agree that there isn't just one optimal way to implement filters for blockchain data, and that a service with different tradeoffs should be advertised with NODE_BLOOM. They also note that an upgrade will be needed to allow nodes to advertise ranges of blocks to fix the issue of pagecache pressure.</p>
