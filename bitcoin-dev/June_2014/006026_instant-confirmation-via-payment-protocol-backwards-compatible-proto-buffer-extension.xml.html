    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, Andreas Schildbach has suggested that the supports_instant field is redundant in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). Lawrence Nahum agrees with this and says that trusted_instant_providers are what they need. He believes that users may not want to pay for instant when the merchant may not accept it or care, even if it would not break the protocol; it would still be a waste of fees. Furthermore, Lawrence Nahum notes that not all transactions from GreenAddress provide double spend protection as there are additional checks on prevout that are normally not done when spending normally. However, Andreas Schildbach has more questions regarding the use of the Transactions message and briefly describes the whole flow of messages on an example including the BIP70 messages. Finally, he asks whether adding multiple signatures from different instant providers or while transitioning to another PKI should be allowed.</p>
