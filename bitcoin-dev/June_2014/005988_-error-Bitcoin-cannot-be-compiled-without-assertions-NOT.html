    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, the Linux kernel wisdom is to compile in as many cheap, compiler-predictable asserts as possible into the production runtime. Debug builds are of limited value because users do not recompile software just to provide better bug reports/diagnostics. It is important to make it easy for users to send reports that are useful to programmers. Expensive diagnostics are fine, but they should be compiled in and disabled by default at runtime so that they do not slow down the system when turned off.Moreover, the assert/dump should provide a high level of diagnostics, such as a stack trace of each thread and a multi-threaded core dump. These features are a good start for providing useful information to programmers. Jeff Garzik works at BitPay, Inc., a company that provides payment services for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin payments.</p>
