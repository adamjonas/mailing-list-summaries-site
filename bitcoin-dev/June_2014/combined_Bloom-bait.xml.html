        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation from June 6, 2014, Peter Todd discussed the use of prefix selection as a means of providing privacy for blockchain data. He argued that it was not necessary to use brute-force prefix selection and that one could instead give a peer multiple prefixes, each corresponding to at least one address in the wallet, with some false positive rate. Todd had previously explained this in detail in his original blockchain data privacy writeup.The recipient of Todd's email disagreed with him, saying that it was surprising that he claimed that data published in a super public manner was no different than something used between nodes. They suggested that Todd's arguments needed to be communicated differently.Todd responded by explaining that prefix filters have O(log n) scaling with slightly higher k than bloom filters, which have O(n) scaling. However, if one does not use brute forcing in conjunction with prefixes, they provide no different transactional graph privacy than bloom filters.The recipient still did not see the usefulness of prefix filtering for DH-private outputs, stating that it complicates the security story and doesn't seem necessary for scanning performance. They also questioned how Todd could claim that something burned forever into the blockchain could provide the same level of privacy as something shared directly with trusted peers.</p>
