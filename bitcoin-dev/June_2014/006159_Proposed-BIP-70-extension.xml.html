    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the implementation of a discount for paying with Bitcoin (BTC) in the payment protocol extensions process, which could be beneficial for adoption. Some complementary currencies backed by national currencies offer discounts when converting from fiat to complementary, but the difference is that each merchant can set their own discount in BTC. The implementation would require a percentage or proportion rather than an amount in satoshis. On security, as an optional field, it does not seem harmful, and wallets can ignore the field if they wish. It is suggested that this extension could be a simple way to develop the extension process. However, some members argue that the protocol should contain more features to help users and adoption. The plan is to set up the extension process formally using something simple and to have a living document version of the payment protocol with all the different extensions.</p>
