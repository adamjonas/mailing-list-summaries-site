    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Wladimir and Pavel Janík, Wladimir mentioned about doing a last-minute language import if he does not hear anything. However, Pavel warned him that this import could actually break things and advised him to avoid it. The conversation suggests that Wladimir was planning to undertake an action related to language import, but the consequences of such an action were not clear. Pavel's warning indicates that the import could have adverse effects on some aspects, which is why he suggested Wladimir to avoid it.</p>
