    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Lawrence Nahum, founder of GreenAddress, a BIP32 multisignature service and instant confirmation platform available in the form of web socket APIs and Wallet for mobile, desktop, and web, posted a message to the Bitcoin-Development mailing list. He introduced himself and requested feedback, comments, and reviews about a BIP70 payment protocol protobuf extension proposal. The proposal can be found on GitHub. A quick comment was made on the supports_instant field, which seems redundant. The commenter suggested that it can be derived from trusted_instant_providers as per the spec. Additionally, Protobuf is designed to ignore fields that it doesn't know, so instant_* fields can be sent in the Payment message without any harm. Lawrence Nahum's background is in CS with distributed systems, and he has worked most of his career in the City on OTC financial services like confirmation and clearing platforms. The white paper for GreenAddress can be found here, and their homepage is here.</p>
