    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd dated June 18, 2014, the two discussed proposed changes to Bitcoin's code. Andresen suggested that all changes should be separate pull requests, as large ones are harder to review and more likely to be extensively debated. Todd disagreed, noting that the malleability protection change had already been heavily reviewed and would be beneficial. The two also discussed whether future soft-forks would always require a transaction nVersion bump or if a whitelist was necessary to protect against invalid up-version transactions. Todd noted that the code necessary to restrict opcodes to the softfork-safe subset was trivial and could always be removed later. Additionally, he raised concerns about the potential for "do-nothing" behavior with OP_NOPx and the need for compatible evalscript() code.</p>
