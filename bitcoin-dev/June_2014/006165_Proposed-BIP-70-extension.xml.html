    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the process of creating payment protocol extensions. It is suggested that a living document be created to keep track of all extensions, which will prevent field numbers from colliding and simplify programming tasks. However, it is recommended that the document not be called BIP70, as it is an outdated version of the protocol. There is also discussion around implementing discounts for paying with BTC and how this could affect adoption and velocity. A percentage/proportion discount is suggested over an amount in satoshis. The security of the optional discount field is discussed, as merchants can lie about the discount, but wallets can choose to ignore the field if they wish. Finally, Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik signs off on the email.</p>
