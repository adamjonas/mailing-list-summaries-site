        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposed BIP 70 extension aims to allow merchants to scan wallets through bar code readers, initiating a payment request flow. Current mechanisms for initiating BIP70 payment flows require wallets to either scan a merchant barcode or click on a specially formatted URL link. However, successful non-bitcoin mobile wallet apps allow for the wallet app to be scanned by the merchant. To achieve broad bitcoin adoption, a mechanism for wallets to be scanned by merchant bar code readers at brick and mortar shops is needed. The BillRequest message includes a Unix timestamp when it was created and an optional expiration date after which it should be considered invalid.It also includes a bill_request_uri, which can be a URL where a BIP70 payment request can be sent that is being monitored by the wallet, as well as other URI options like "sms:860-555-1212" or "mailto:asdf at gmail.com." It is recommended that wallet apps display a non-QR barcode like a PDF417 barcode to initiate the Bill Request flow to avoid confusion with existing QR code usage in wallet apps. While NFC technology may obviate the need for this extension, it remains uncommon and may not be suitable for smaller wearables entering the market. The proposed BIP 70 extension would greatly ease checkouts at drive-throughs and allow merchants to leverage existing hardware.The writer believes that both BIP70 and Bluetooth payment mechanisms can coexist and suggests that a QR code next to a cash register can be fixed and printed on paper when using BIP70. The PoS would upload payment details to the server, which would then serve it when the user scans the QR code. Alternatively, Andreas' work on Bluetooth may be more appropriate; the QR code can contain the BT MAC of the device, and the payment request is downloaded that way. This approach is already implemented. The writer has a project in mind, making NFC-QRcode hybrids and a simple PoS app to go with them, but does not have the time to pursue it. It is recommended that different technologies should be explored to see what works best in practice before trying to write a specification. The proposal is quite complex with new barcode types, and the best way to move it forward at this stage is to implement it in some existing wallets.</p>
