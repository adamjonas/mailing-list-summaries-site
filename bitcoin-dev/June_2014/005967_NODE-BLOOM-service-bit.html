    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed update in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is to add NODE_BLOOM as a service bit to allow nodes to announce their support for bloom filters. This will bump the network protocol version number and the recommended behavior for nodes that do not support bloom filters is to disconnect peers who send filter messages anyway. Bloom filters are not universally supported and have poor scaling properties, which can lead to high IO loads and DoS attacks. In the long term, they will be replaced by prefix-based filtering, which is already being implemented in electrum and obelisk. The proposal has been deployed on Litecoin, Dogecoin, and other alts without issues. Gregory Maxwell requested to assign a BIP number for the proposal.</p>
