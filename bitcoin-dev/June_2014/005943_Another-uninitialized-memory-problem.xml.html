    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about an uninitialized memory problem in Bitcoin. Toshi Morita reported the issue and Jeff Garzik responded, saying that he thinks he sees the problem. Toshi Morita confirmed that both sides of the comparison were uninitialized and he fixed one side but the other still has the same problem. He also said that he would investigate further once he gets out of meetings/meetings prep. Jeff Garzik ended the conversation by stating that he is a Bitcoin core developer and an open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc. A link to a pull request on Github was also provided for fixing the issue.</p>
