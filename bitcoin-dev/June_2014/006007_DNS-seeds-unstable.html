    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Alex Kotenko has successfully created a testnet seed for bitcoinj, which he shared on GitHub. He had previously abandoned the idea of DNS forwarding and is now only serving the testnet seed as it is deemed more important at the moment than a mainnet one. The testnet seed can be found at testnet-seed.alexykot.me. Andreas Schildbach informed Alex that his seeds were not reachable from his ISP. This message was sent through the Bitcoin-development mailing list. The email also included an advertisement for HPCC Systems Open Source Big Data Platform from LexisNexis Risk Solutions.</p>
