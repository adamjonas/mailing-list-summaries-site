        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this context, a proposal by Sergio Lerner is being discussed as a way to prevent mining pools and reduce variance in Bitcoin payoffs. The proposal involves increasing the block-rate by at least 20 times and changing the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work (PoW) while allowing current Bitcoin ASICs to work. The proposed BlockPow discourages mining pools by increasing bandwidth requirements for pool administrators to serve miners with fresh block templates. The proposal requires an infrastructure that makes use of getblocktemplate technology to perform local transaction selection. However, decentralization of mining pools has not been widespread due to implementation issues with software such as libblkmaker. Slush, the founder of Slush Pool, suggests using Stratum + Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) validation on miner side instead.In addition, there is a discussion about the challenges faced by mining pools in validating transactions. The author raises concerns about how a pool can ensure miners are running up-to-date software to perform full validation of transactions. Additionally, if every miner takes their own set of transactions, the pool must calculate the merkle root for every submission to check its correctness. Mark Friedenbach suggests stochastically validating a randomly selected sample of shares as a solution to protect against incorrect mining software and detect invalid blocks.The proposal being discussed is not fully compatible with Bitcoin ASICs but can be made partially compatible with some tweaks. The proposal replaces the hashMerkleRoot and hashPrevBlock fields with ChildBlock and ScatteredBlockBytes fields. ChildBlock is the hash of a message that stores the old hashMerkleRoot and hashPrevBlock, while ScatteredBlockBytes is a pseudo-random subset of bytes taken from the block template being mined. The proposed method aims to discourage mining pools and reduce payoff variance by discouraging pool administrators from keeping a secret mid-state of the hash function to prevent block stealing while forcing miners to know the block in the inner mining loop. The proposed method requires an infrastructure that makes use of getblocktemplate technology to perform local transaction selection. Furthermore, the context discusses the concern raised by Slush regarding how the pool can ensure that miners are using up-to-date bitcoind for full transaction validation and the concern that if every miner takes his own set of transactions, the pool needs to calculate the merkle root for each submission to verify its accuracy. It is emphasized that the pool operator should not be concerned about which software the miner is utilizing to select transactions for their block, as long as they follow the template and do not produce invalid blocks.Finally, it is noted that the proposed method to discourage mining pools only works as long as the time it takes to transmit a block is comparable to the block interval time. The context also mentions the trend to look at the misbehavior of specialists in an economy with a division of labor and instead of fixing the misbehavior, deciding to throw out the entire concept of labor specialization. The message ends with a reminder to support online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible.</p>
