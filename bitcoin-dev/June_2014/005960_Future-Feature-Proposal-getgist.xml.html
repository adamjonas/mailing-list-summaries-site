    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Bitcoin developer has proposed a new command, getgist(), which could significantly speed up the process of syncing block headers. Currently, headers must be grabbed one at a time, but with the new command, many headers could be obtained simultaneously from different peers. The inputs would be similar to the existing getheaders() command, but with an additional field for segment_count. The response would be a spaced out headers message, with block hashes aligned to every 2000th block from the first block hash. While there are existing methods for syncing headers, such as checkpoint nodes or bootstrap data files, these can rely on semi-centralisation and may not be as effective. The developer is currently testing the command to determine its potential speed gains.</p>
