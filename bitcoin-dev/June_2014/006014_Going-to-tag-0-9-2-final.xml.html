    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In June 2014, a discussion occurred between two individuals, xor and Wladimir, regarding a potential last-minute language import for Bitcoin Core. Xor expressed concern over making changes to high-risk projects like Bitcoin, as any mistakes could cause severe issues. They suggested that there should be no changes between release candidates and releases. The discussion also brought up the idea of having a release cycle policy for Bitcoin Core. Mission-critical projects typically have a code and resource freeze prior to tagging a release candidate, after which only critical bugfixes are allowed into the release branch. Xor argued that a language translation update did not qualify as a critical bugfix and should be merged during the next release cycle. It is important to note the emphasis on avoiding any unnecessary changes to such a complex system like Bitcoin Core.</p>
