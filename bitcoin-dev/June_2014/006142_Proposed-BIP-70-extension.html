    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the validity of marketing claims that promote Bitcoin as a way to "save" on transaction fees. The person expressing doubt suggests that while users may save on satoshis, they may also be getting scammed by merchants who cut BTC/USD exchange rates by tens of percent. However, the other person argues that wallets can compare the exchange rate and what the user is getting. They also believe that assuming all customers are being scammed is an extreme position since many merchants care about their reputation and want to avoid card fees. The conversation then shifts to the payment protocol and whether or not it should contain information about these exchange rates. The second person believes that the protocol should contain whatever is useful and plans to draft a BIP for this next week.</p>
