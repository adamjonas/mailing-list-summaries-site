    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion thread begins with a comment on a patch that can't prevent double spends minutes apart, and the fact that Tom runs a page where he shows double spends detected by his node or relayed by theirs. The conversation then shifts towards the potential for arbitrage opportunities and liquidity when it comes to high-frequency trading between exchanges. However, the focus is then put on the consumer case and whether or not the market will naturally converge to a handful of hubs that will help with refunds and dispute mediation. The response is that there will be many kinds of trades where dispute mediation is unnecessary, and in such cases, there won't necessarily be a need for third parties. However, for transactions where dispute mediation is necessary, it's expected that there will be a handful of well-known trusted names for the majority of such transactions, and then a long tail of specialists who only mediate specific types of purchases.</p>
