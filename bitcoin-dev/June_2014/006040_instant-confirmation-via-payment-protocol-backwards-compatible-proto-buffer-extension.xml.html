    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context given, a question is being asked about whether the payment protocol is the right place to put an instant provider signature. The answer provided is affirmative, as the original concept of green addresses was based on identifying a trusted wallet by checking which keys were used to sign. However, this approach lacks privacy since everyone can see what wallet provider is being used. Additionally, it would be inefficient to have extra signatures in the chain, as double spend risk is only a concern for the recipient. Therefore, the payment protocol is deemed to be the appropriate location for the instant provider signature.</p>
