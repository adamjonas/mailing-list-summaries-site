    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context at hand, it is discussed that the pool operator should not be concerned about which software the miner is utilizing to select transactions for their block, as long as they follow the template and do not produce invalid blocks. Invalid blocks were previously discussed, and checking the template requires verifying the merkleroot and parsing the coinbase transaction. The most costly operations are the hashes in the merkleroot verification, but this must be done in stratum due to the extranonce.Slush raises an issue regarding how the pool can ensure that miners are using up-to-date bitcoind for full transaction validation, along with the concern that if every miner takes his own set of transactions, the pool needs to calculate the merkle root for each submission to verify its accuracy.</p>
