    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the scalability of a proposed payment message system for instant-confirmation providers in Bitcoin transactions. Some members express concern that including every possible provider may not be feasible if there are a large number of them. However, others argue that the project's goal is to avoid relying on trusted third parties for in-person payments and choosing a smaller number of providers goes against this. One suggested solution is for users to send the name and signature of their chosen provider with each transaction, but this is incompatible with providers charging extra fees for "instantness." The idea of allowing optional selection of instantness is also deemed impractical as the merchant, not the user, would benefit from double-spend protection. The group remains undecided on the best approach, weighing scalability against the project's goals and user experience.</p>
