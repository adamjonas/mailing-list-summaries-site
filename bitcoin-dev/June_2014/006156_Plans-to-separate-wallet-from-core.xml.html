    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the wallet code and GUI mapping 1:1. The writer clarifies that when referring to the wallet, they mean the wallet code, not the GUI. They state that there are very few reasons for running a wallet 24/7, except in cases such as running an exchange that has to send and receive transactions all the time. For the usual merchant/end-user case, it is mostly receiving transactions and sometimes manually or batched-sending them. There is no need to leave the wallet running, exposed to the network outside those times. The writer also points out that how the wallet GUI (if any) relates to the wallet code is a completely different topic and a much less pressing matter. Anything from 'GUI uses wallet as a library' (multibit, electrum, bitcoin core) to elaborate client-server protocols (btcd, coinvault?) are acceptable depending on the use case.</p>
