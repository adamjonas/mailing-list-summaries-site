        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Bitcointalk forum thread, an announcement was made about a bounty, but the current status of the bounty remains uncertain as of January 2014. However, it is known that the multisig address associated with the bounty continues to accumulate bitcoins. There have been discussions on other mailing lists about the possibility of paying a portion or all of the bounty to the Dark Wallet team. For more information, Gregory Maxwell suggests visiting the Bitcointalk forum thread.In June 2014, Odinn Cyberguerrilla posted a question regarding the CoinJoin bounty fund address. He was looking for information on what happens to the funds in that address. The correct place to find more information was stated to be the Bitcointalk forum thread where the bounty was announced. The link to this thread is provided as <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0.Odinn,">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0.Odinn,</a> a Bitcoin enthusiast, had encouraged people to donate to the CoinJoin bounty fund in 2013 after coming across some discussions on Reddit. The address associated with the fund is a P2SH/multisignature one. Odinn has noticed that CoinJoin has been implemented in various places since then, such as blockchain.info and Sharedcoin by github.com. Now, he is curious about what the CoinJoin bounty fund currently supports and where it is intended to go. He wonders if it will help fund other projects or not. According to Odinn, the right place to ask this question is the bitcoin-development list, rather than platforms like Twitter.</p>
