        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Odinn Cyberguerrilla, a Bitcoin enthusiast, is looking for information about the CoinJoin bounty fund address, which he encouraged people to donate to in 2013 after seeing some Reddit discussions. The address is a P2SH/multisignature one and has been accumulating bitcoins since then. Odinn has noticed that CoinJoin has been implemented in various places such as blockchain.info and Sharedcoin by github.com; however, he does not have any concrete information about the current status of the bounty except that the multisig address continues to accumulate bitcoin.There has been talk on other mailing lists about potentially paying a portion or all of the bounty to the Dark Wallet team but there is no definite information. Odinn believes that the bitcoin-development list is the right place for this question, rather than on twitter or similar. In June 2014, Odinn posted a question regarding the CoinJoin bounty fund address on the bitcoin-development list asking what happens to the funds in the address and where it's intended to go. Gregory Maxwell suggested visiting the Bitcointalk forum thread where an announcement was made regarding the bounty. However, as of January 2014, there is no definite information about the current status of the bounty except for the fact that the multisig address continues to accumulate bitcoins.
