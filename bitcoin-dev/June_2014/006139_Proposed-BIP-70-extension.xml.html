    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik, the former proposed an idea where wallets can persist data on how much money users have saved over time. Jeff Garzik acknowledged this as a cool idea but warned that it might be subject to instant inflation since it is unprovable and rational economic actors may choose to exaggerate the numbers. He suggested adding "marketing_" to the field name itself or including comment caveats noting in bold language that the field is informational and should not be relied upon for accounting/auditing purposes. Jeff further stated that the statistic seemed like something that everyone had an incentive to exaggerate. Jeff Garzik is a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist working with BitPay Inc.</p>
