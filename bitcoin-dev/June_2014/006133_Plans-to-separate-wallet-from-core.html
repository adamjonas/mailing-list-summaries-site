    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter and the author of the context agree on keeping bitcoind as lean as possible, which means maintaining extra indices for others does not fit in. The idea of an 'index node' is suggested to be a different approach. The goal is to make a p2p node as useful as possible within its resource constraints and optional advertising of new indexes is the way to go. However, the author questions whether having an RPC or new socket based method would be too complex for users who just want to help out the system. Therefore, a single unified program that automatically figures it out rather than expecting users to assemble a bag of parts seems like a more practical goal.</p>
