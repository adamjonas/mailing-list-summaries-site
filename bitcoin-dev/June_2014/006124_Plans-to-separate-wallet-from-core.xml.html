    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context, Wladimir suggested that using P2P primarily for an SPV client would be the least surprising option. He proposed separating the wallet from the core, where bitcoind will support SPV mode and an optional trusted core by RPC for mempool/conflicted transaction validation. However, he was uncertain about this idea as pure-SPV wallets work well. There were no plans to add Electrum-like functionality to bitcoind, and Bitcoin companies could interface with the network via bitcoind nodes. The wallet does not need to keep a full chain database but requires its own record of the chain, headers-only + what concerns the keys in the wallet. The plan seemed unclear to some, but it was assumed that both the core and the wallet would run alongside each other, and the code would be separated for better modularity.</p>
