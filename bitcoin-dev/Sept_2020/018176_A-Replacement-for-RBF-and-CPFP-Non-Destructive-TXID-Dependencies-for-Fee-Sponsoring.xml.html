    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the speaker is responding to Cory's questions about whether implementing RBF/CPFP (Replace-By-Fee/Child-Pays-For-Parent) in Bitcoin transactions would worsen privacy. The speaker believes that there are reasons why it wouldn't: RBF/CPFP may require using an external transaction to pay sufficient fees, which could potentially leak information about which address was the change and which was the payment. Additionally, RBF/CPFP requires access to the same security zone as the original payment, whereas sponsors can be anyone and fully separate from the payment. The speaker also notes several benefits of using RBF/CPFP, including the ability to continually coinjoin funds in a fee-paying wallet without tainting main funds, keeping funds in a lightning channel and paying fees via loop outs. The conversation includes technical terms and links to further information on these topics.</p>
