    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a response to Franck's questions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Brooks explains why he chose to maximize value in his proposed solution, which involves using a genetic algorithm and a fitness score to determine the fittest chain. He notes that this approach can lead to determinism, but suggests that it doesn't have to be this way. When Franck asks about the impact of difficulty adjustments, Mike acknowledges that it is an important consideration and proposes a solution that always chooses the smallest chain with a non-zero value, and minimizes the summation of all contestant chains. He argues that this approach is compatible with an epoch and a continuous difficulty function, which would add stability to the network and make it possible to speed up block creation times. Mike believes that incremental soft-forks can help improve the Bitcoin network and is proposing a patch that is fully compatible with the current network and requires only ~100 lines of code. He encourages other miners to adopt his patch for even better results.</p>
