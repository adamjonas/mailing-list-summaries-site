    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A draft proposal for a mechanism to replace CPFP and RBF for increasing fees on transactions in the mempool that should be more robust against attacks has been shared with Bitcoin Devs. The proposed mechanism proposes a general-purpose mechanism for expressing non-destructive dependencies on specific transactions being in the same block that can be used to sponsor fees of remote transactions. The motivation behind this proposal is to protect the network from denial of service. The policy specification mentions that no transaction with a Sponsor Vector may have any child spends; and no transaction with a Sponsor Vector may have any unconfirmed parents; and the Sponsor Vector must have exactly 1 entry. A reference implementation demonstrating these rules is also provided. This is a best effort implementation, but has not been carefully audited for correctness and likely diverges from this document in ways that should either be reflected in this document or amended in the code.</p>
