    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, Mike Brooks discussed the benefits of using fitness tests to prevent block replacement. He noted that with a fitness test, there is a 100% chance of a new block being accepted, and only a 50% or less chance for replacing a block which has already been mined. This incentivizes moving forward. The topic of fitness tests has been previously discussed in response to the selfish mining paper. A proposal from 2013 included responses highlighting the challenges of replacing first seen as the tip disambiguation method. There may be more related discussion on BitcoinTalk. Dave provided links to some useful posts in the thread.</p>
