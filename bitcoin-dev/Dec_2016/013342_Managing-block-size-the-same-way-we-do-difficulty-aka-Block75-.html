    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Block75 proposal suggests adjusting the maximum block size every two weeks based on a target capacity of 75% full, with a system similar to how difficulty is calculated. The target capacity over 2016 blocks would be 75%, and if the last 2016 blocks are more than 75% full, add the difference to the max block size. However, this system may be prone to gaming by miners trying to collect fees, and there must be a maximum block size that the network will allow as a consensus rule. Additionally, increasing the block size dynamically based on transaction volume may reach a point where it breaks things, and Bitcoin can scale by using off-chain solutions. The proposal attempts to keep blocks at 75% total capacity over each two week period, similarly to how difficulty tries to keep blocks mined every ten minutes, while keeping blocks as small as possible.</p>
