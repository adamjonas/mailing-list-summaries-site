    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on bitcoin-dev, Alice Wonder expressed her reluctance to update to version 0.13.0 of Bitcoin due to failing tests caused by Python errors. She mentioned that the issues were addressed on bitcointalk but new Python errors were introduced in version 0.13.1 which led her to abandon the update altogether. On being asked for more information about the issues encountered, Alice explained that the LANG environment variable was the main cause of the problem and she had to set it to "en_US.utf8" before running the test suite for version 0.13.0. However, she noticed that this issue was fixed in version 0.13.1. The errors encountered in version 0.13.1 arose while running the "bitcoin-util-test.py" file, which led to a traceback error. The error message shows that the test failed because it was unable to find the file "./test/data/blanktx.json", resulting in an Error 1. Alice also mentioned that she builds in a clean chroot build environment to avoid linking to non-standard libraries and that normally, the LANG environment variable does not affect software compilation. Despite these issues, Alice reported that version 0.13.0 worked fine once the LANG variable was set to "en_US.utf8".</p>
