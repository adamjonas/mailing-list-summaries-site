    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Bitcoin developer, Matt Corallo, has urged people to report bugs to the Bitcoin Github repository. He explained that if bugs aren't reported, they won't get fixed. One user, Alice Wonder, stated that she almost didn't update to version 0.13.0 because of Python errors in the test suite. She added that when the test suite actually works in her environment, she will upgrade. She's not willing to jump through hoops to make it work and isn't running clients that haven't passed the test suite. It's possible that lack of Python 3 dependency on older CentOS builds could be a reason for node operator's lack of client upgrades.</p>
