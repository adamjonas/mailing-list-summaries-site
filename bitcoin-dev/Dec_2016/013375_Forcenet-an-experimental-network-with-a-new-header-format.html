    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the issue with redefining nSigOp in a sum tree, which requires a hardfork or a new sum tree. The solution proposed is to explicitly commit to the weight and nSigOp, with a committed value that is equal to or larger than the real value. However, this comes with an overhead of 16 bytes per transaction. The weight and sigop count could be transmitted as variable length integers to reduce the overhead. Additionally, it is suggested that the two costs could be combined into a unified cost to make it easier for miners to decide what to charge. The thread also mentions the use of a sum tree for partial validation and fraud proofs in a new merkle algorithm, with a PR available on Github. The sum tree sums up sigops, block size, block cost (weight), and fees.</p>
