    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A message was posted on Bitcoin-dev mailing list by Alice Wonder on December 18, 2016 at 12:07:36 PM PST, in response to Juan Garavaglia's post about the significant number of node operators that do not upgrade their clients. Wonder stated that she almost did not update to version 0.13.0 because the test suite was failing due to python errors and when 0.13.1 came with new python errors in the test suite, she decided not to upgrade. She further added that until the test suite actually works in her fairly standard environment (CentOS) in the distributed release, she will not upgrade. Wonder mentioned that she is not aware of any test suite failures and also urged everyone to report bugs as they won't get fixed if not reported. She provided a link to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a> for bug reporting. She also knows a bunch of folks who use CentOS but is not sure how many develop on it.</p>
