    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around the issue of how to encourage users to upgrade their node versions in order to avoid compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities. One suggestion was to implement a message system that would notify users of available updates and the potential risks they face if they don't upgrade. Another idea was to automatically distribute patches and updates, making the process easier for users. However, it was noted that automatic upgrades are not desirable in all cases. A proposal was put forth to introduce planned obsolescence in each new version of Bitcoin Core in order to avoid fragmentation of the protocol and simplify the developers' jobs. The suggested timeframe for each version's validity was one year, after which non-upgraded nodes would stop working. However, there were concerns about the effectiveness of this approach, as well as the potential for anti-features to be removed by users. It was suggested that a simpler solution would be to stop supporting older versions, as developers have limited resources and are rarely interested in fixing bugs for outdated software.</p>
