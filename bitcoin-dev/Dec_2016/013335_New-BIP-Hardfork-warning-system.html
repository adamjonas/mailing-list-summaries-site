    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context provided, the discussion is around the use of softforks and hardforks in cryptocurrency. The writer questions the need for a softfork to warn about soft-hardforks, as they believe that the highest bit in nVersion can already be used to warn about invalid blocks resulting from a hardfork. They suggest that using another prohibited bit to signal a soft-hardfork may be more appropriate, but then question whether this would simply make it a hardfork rather than a soft-hardfork. The writer goes on to point out that their proposed softfork would result in soft-hardforks being viewed as hardforks for nodes that have upgraded to the softfork, while still being viewed as softforks for older nodes. They question whether this is intended behavior and why it is necessary.Overall, the writer suggests that a simpler BIP that doesn't require a softfork may be a better option. They propose that the currently invalid bits be used for soft-hardforks, but question why these should appear as invalid blocks for older nodes instead of using regular softfork warnings.</p>
