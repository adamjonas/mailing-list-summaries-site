    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed Block75 system aims to manage Bitcoin's maximum block size in a predictable and effective way, similar to the current two-week adjustment of difficulty. This system adjusts the maximum block size every 2016 blocks based on the average fullness of the last 2016 blocks, with a target capacity of 75%. If the last 2016 blocks are more than 75% full, the difference is added to the maximum block size. However, some concerns have been raised about the potential impact on block propagation time and the risk of miners gaming the system by filling the network with transactions. Despite these concerns, the frequent and small adjustments made by Block75 make it easier for miners and node operators to adapt to the changing conditions. Ultimately, there needs to be a consensus rule for the maximum block size, but the Block75 system provides an automated and scalable solution that can potentially prevent wild swings in block size or transaction fees.</p>
