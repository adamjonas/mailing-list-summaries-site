    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, James Hilliard expresses concern that miners will increase block sizes to maximize transaction fees. He states that doubling the block size every year would cause significant issues and the proposed Block75 allows for over a 7x increase. However, it is clarified that Block75 is not exponential scaling and the maximum increase in the first year would be 7x, with subsequent years increasing at a slower rate. The maximum increase in the first year is unlikely to occur as all blocks would have to be 100% full and transactions would have to increase at the same rate. Furthermore, users have no control over miners' ability to increase block size, but they can choose not to send transactions. Overall, the max block size is expected to grow and shrink at a slower rate, especially with SegWit.</p>
