    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Juan Garavaglia, a contributor to bitcoin-dev mailing list, has suggested implementing planned obsolescence in each new version of "Bitcoin Core" node software. The proposed change aims to avoid fragmentation of the network due to outdated versions and simplify developers' jobs. The suggestion recommends that after a new version is released, it will remain valid for approximately one year before becoming obsolete and incompatible with the network. If a node does not upgrade, it will stop working instead of participating in the network with an outdated protocol version. However, some users may remove anti-features like this from free software. A simpler solution, such as stopping maintenance and support for older versions, has been suggested in response to this proposal. Developers rarely fix bugs for very old versions, and users should not expect things to be backported to old versions.</p>
