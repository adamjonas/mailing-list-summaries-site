    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of Block75 suggests aiming for blocks that are 75% full regardless of size, rather than having a capped block size limit. However, Bram Cohen argues that this approach suffers from the same problems as Bitcoin Unlimited, where there are ultimately no transaction fees and some miners may want to impose caps on block size resulting in a fork. The success of difficulty adjustment lies in having a clear goal of making new blocks at a certain rate. Hardcoding a cap would not be a permanent solution and would only create roadblocks. Under Block75, there will still be full blocks with transaction fees and a fee market, but the fees will be lower than they are now. Permanent solutions are preferred.</p>
