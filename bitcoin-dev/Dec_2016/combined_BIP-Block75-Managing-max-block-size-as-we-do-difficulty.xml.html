        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal for a new BIP, "Block75", suggests adjusting the maximum size of a block based on the average size of previous blocks. This formula would be recalculated every 2016 blocks to ensure that blocks are kept at 75% full, which would prevent wild swings in transaction fees and allow moderate growth. The idea behind this proposal is to manage maximum block size in a reasonable and predictable way without human involvement in decision-making. The author argues against solutions involving an arbitrary maximum block size or passing the decision onto miners/pool operators for a vote because they will be temporary, political, and contentious. A permanent solution that responds to changing transaction volumes is required.The proposed specification involves adjusting MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE using a simple formula with TARGET_CAPACITY set to 750000 (representing 75% of block capacity). However, there are concerns about its technical soundness as the specification only affects MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE and does not adjust the maximum block size directly. Additionally, a missing section on backward compatibility should address the fact that this solution is not backward compatible and propose a mechanism for establishing agreement from the entire community for its deployment.The rationale behind selecting the 75% full block target is that it represents a middle ground between blocks being too small and unnecessarily large. It can absorb short-term spikes in transaction volume and limits the growth of max block size to 250KB over the previous period. The 2016 blocks (two week) period was selected as it has been shown to be reasonably adaptive to changing network resources. The proposal is placed in the public domain for copyright purposes.</p>
