    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Juan Garavaglia expressed concern over the significant number of node operators who do not update their clients. As an example, he mentioned that he almost did not update to version 0.13.0 due to failing python errors in the test suite, which he found a solution for on bitcointalk. However, when version 0.13.1 was released with new python errors in the test suite, he decided not to upgrade at all. Garavaglia stated that he will only upgrade when the test suite works in his standard environment (CentOS). He also added that he will not run clients that have not passed the test suite.</p>
