    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joost Jager discusses the advantages of the taproot annex in an email. He explains that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of the transaction ID (txid) or a potential parent commit transaction's txid, making it a powerful tool for applications that use covenants. Joost specifically mentions the importance of time-locked vaults and how pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term.To ensure the vault can always be "opened," Joost suggests backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself. However, without the annex, there is a circular reference problem that prevents the creation of the vault and signature backup from being executed in one atomic operation. This means that if a vault is created and the ephemeral signatures are lost, the funds will be lost as well.Although this use case for the annex has been labeled as "speculative" elsewhere, Joost argues that it is relevant considering the importance of time-locked vaults for Bitcoin and the difficulty in implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT. To support this use case, Joost has created a simple demo application that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a pre-defined final destination using the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction.Joost hopes that this demo application raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex. He also notes that more advanced covenants, such as time-locked vaults, can be implemented similarly.</p>
