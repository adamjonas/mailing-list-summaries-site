    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joost Jager highlights the primary advantage of the taproot annex, stating that its data is not included in the calculation of the txid or a potential parent commit transaction's txid. This feature makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. The most critical application in this category, according to Joost, involves time-locked vaults.He mentions that proposals like OP_VAULT have received a positive reception, indicating that there is interest in improving the safeguarding of Bitcoin. While OP_VAULT may take some time to implement, pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can fill the gap and enhance the security of Bitcoin in the short term.However, without the annex, backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is not as safe as it could be. Due to a circular reference problem, the vault creation and signature backup cannot be executed in one atomic operation. Storing the backup in a child commit/reveal transaction set is one option, but the vault itself can be confirmed independently, potentially resulting in the backup never being confirmed. This means that if a vault is created and the ephemeral signatures are lost, the funds will be lost as well.While this use case for the annex has been labeled as 'speculative' elsewhere, Joost argues that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex isn't available. He believes that if time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and implementing soft forks like the one required for OP_VAULT is challenging, the intermediate solution described above is highly relevant.To support this use case of the taproot annex, Joost has created a simple demo application. The demo demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved only to a pre-defined final destination. The annex is used to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. While this demo may not be practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Joost hopes that this demo application will raise further awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex. He provides a link to the GitHub repository where the demo application can be found.Overall, Joost emphasizes the importance of the taproot annex for applications like time-locked vaults and highlights its unique capabilities in securely storing ephemeral signatures on the blockchain.</p>
