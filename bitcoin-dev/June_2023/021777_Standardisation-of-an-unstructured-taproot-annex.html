    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Joost Jager discusses the advantages of the taproot annex and its potential applications. He highlights that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of transaction IDs or parent commit transaction IDs, making it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. One critical application he mentions is time-locked vaults, which have received positive reception through proposals like OP_VAULT. While OP_VAULT may be further out, pre-signed transactions using ephemeral keys can serve as an interim solution to improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin.However, without the annex, there is a circular reference problem that prevents the execution of vault creation and signature backup in one atomic operation. Storing the backup in a child commit/reveal transaction set is possible, but the vault itself can be confirmed independently, potentially leading to the backup never confirming. If a vault is created and the ephemeral signatures are lost, the funds will be lost as well.Joost acknowledges that this specific use case for the annex has been labeled as speculative, but argues that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex is not yet available. Considering the importance of time-locked vaults for Bitcoin and the difficulty of implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT, he believes the intermediate solution described earlier is highly relevant.To support this use case, Joost has created a simple demo application that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved only to a pre-defined final destination. The demo utilizes the annex to store the ephemeral signature, ensuring that the coin cannot be lost. Although the application may not be the most practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented in a similar manner.Joost hopes that this demo application will raise awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.[1] - Joost explains the advantage of the annex: [link][2] - OP_VAULT proposal: [link]Demo application: [link]</p>
