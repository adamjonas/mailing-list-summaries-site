    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Joost Jager discusses the advantages of the taproot annex in Bitcoin. He explains that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of transaction IDs or potential parent commit transaction IDs. This makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. Jager specifically mentions time-locked vaults as a critical application for the annex. He believes that other proposals, such as OP_VAULT, have been positively received and that pre-signed transactions using ephemeral keys can fill the gap and improve Bitcoin security in the short term. However, without the annex, the creation of a vault and the backup of ephemeral signatures cannot be executed in one atomic operation. This poses a risk of losing funds if the signatures are lost. Jager acknowledges that this use case for the annex has been labeled as speculative, but argues that it is relevant given the importance of time-locked vaults and the difficulty of implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT. To support this use case, Jager has created a simple demo application that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a pre-defined final destination. The demo uses the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Jager notes that while the demo may not be practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Overall, Jager hopes that his demonstration raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.</p>
