    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent by Joost Jager on June 10, 2023, he discusses the primary advantage of the taproot annex in Bitcoin. He explains that the data in the annex is not included in the calculation of the transaction ID (txid) or a potential parent commit transaction's txid. This feature makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants.One critical application in this category, according to Jager, involves time-locked vaults. He mentions the positive reception to proposals like OP_VAULT and believes that many others share his belief. While OP_VAULT may be further out, Jager suggests that pre-signed transactions signed using ephemeral keys can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term.However, without the annex, backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is not as safe as it could be. Jager explains that due to the circular reference problem, the process of creating the vault and backing up the signature cannot be executed in one atomic operation. If the backup does not confirm independently, losing the ephemeral signatures could result in lost funds.Jager acknowledges that this use case for the annex has been labeled speculative elsewhere, but argues that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex isn't available yet. He believes that if time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and implementing soft forks like the one required for OP_VAULT is challenging, the intermediate solution described above is relevant.To support this use case of the taproot annex, Jager has created a simple demo application that can be found on GitHub. The demo demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a pre-defined final destination. It utilizes the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Jager notes that while the application may not be the most practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.In conclusion, Jager hopes that the demo application raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.</p>
