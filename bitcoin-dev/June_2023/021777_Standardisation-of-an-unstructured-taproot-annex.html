    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Joost Jager discusses the primary advantage of the taproot annex, explaining that its data is not included in the calculation of the transaction identification (txid) or the txid of a potential parent commit transaction. This makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. One critical application in this category involves time-locked vaults, which have received positive reception through proposals such as OP_VAULT. While OP_VAULT may be further out, pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can fill the gap and improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term.However, without the annex, backing up the ephemeral signatures of pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is not as safe as it could be due to the circular reference problem. The vault creation and signature backup cannot be executed in one atomic operation. For example, storing the backup in a child commit/reveal transaction set may result in the vault being confirmed independently without the backup confirming. Losing the ephemeral signatures after creating a vault would result in the loss of funds.While this use case for the annex has been labeled 'speculative' elsewhere, Joost argues that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex is not yet available. However, he believes that if time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and acknowledges that implementing soft forks like the one required for OP_VAULT is not easy, the intermediate solution described above is relevant.To support this use case of the taproot annex, Joost has created a simple demo application that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a pre-defined final destination. The demo uses the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. While the demo may not be the most practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Joost hopes that this demo raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.</p>
