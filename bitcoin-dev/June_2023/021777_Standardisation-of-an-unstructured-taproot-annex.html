    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Joost Jager discusses the advantages of the taproot annex in Bitcoin transactions. He explains that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of the transaction ID (txid) or the parent commit transaction's txid. This makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. Jager highlights time-locked vaults as a critical application for the taproot annex. He mentions the positive reception to proposals such as OP_VAULT and believes that pre-signed transactions using ephemeral keys can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term. However, without the annex, the creation of a vault and the backup of ephemeral signatures cannot be executed in one atomic operation. This poses a risk because if the ephemeral signatures are lost after creating a vault, the funds will be lost as well.Jager acknowledges that this use case for the annex has been labeled as "speculative" elsewhere. However, he argues that if one considers time-locked vaults important for Bitcoin and recognizes the difficulties in implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT, the intermediate solution described above becomes relevant.To support this use case, Jager has created a simple demo application on GitHub. The demo showcases how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a pre-defined final destination. The annex is utilized to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring the coin does not get lost. While the demo may not be practically useful, it serves as an example of how more advanced covenants, such as time-locked vaults, can be implemented using the annex.Overall, Jager hopes that his demo application raises awareness about the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the taproot annex.</p>
