    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent by Joost Jager on June 10, 2023, he discusses the primary advantage of using the taproot annex in Bitcoin. According to Jager, the data in the annex is not included in the calculation of the txid or a potential parent commit transaction's txid, making it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants.Jager specifically highlights the importance of time-locked vaults as a critical application for the taproot annex. He mentions proposals such as OP_VAULT and believes that pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term.However, Jager points out that without the annex, backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is not as safe as it could be. Due to the circular reference problem, the vault creation and signature backup cannot be executed in one atomic operation. In the absence of the annex, if a vault is created and the ephemeral signatures are lost, the funds will also be lost.Jager acknowledges that this use case for the annex has been labeled as speculative elsewhere. However, he argues that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex is not yet available. He emphasizes the relevance of the intermediate solution described above, especially for those who believe that time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and acknowledge the challenges of implementing soft forks like the one required for OP_VAULT.To support this use case, Jager has created a simple demo application that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and then moved to a pre-defined final destination at a later stage. The demo utilizes the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Jager notes that while the application may not be the most practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Jager hopes that this demo application raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the taproot annex. He shares the link to the demo application on GitHub for further exploration.</p>
