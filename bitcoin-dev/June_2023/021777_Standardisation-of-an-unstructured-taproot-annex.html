    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent by Joost Jager on June 10, 2023, he discusses the primary advantage of the taproot annex, which is that its data is not included in the calculation of the transaction ID (txid) or a potential parent commit transaction's txid. This feature makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. Jager explains this advantage in more detail in [1].Jager emphasizes the importance of time-locked vaults as a critical application for the taproot annex. He mentions the positive reception to proposals such as OP_VAULT and believes that pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term. While OP_VAULT may be further out, Jager suggests that pre-signed transactions can fill the gap. However, without the annex, there is a circular reference problem that prevents the execution of vault creation and signature backup in one atomic operation. This creates a risk where the vault can be confirmed independently, but the backup may never confirm. If the ephemeral signatures are lost after creating a vault, the funds will also be lost.Jager acknowledges that some consider this use case for the annex as speculative, but he argues that all use cases appear speculative at this point because the annex is not yet available. However, he believes that if time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and the implementation of soft forks like OP_VAULT is challenging, the intermediate solution described above is highly relevant.To support this use case, Jager has created a simple demo application available on GitHub [2]. The demo demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address that can only move to a pre-defined final destination at a later stage. The annex is used to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Jager notes that while the demo may not be the most practically useful application, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.In conclusion, Jager highlights the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex and hopes that the demo application raises awareness of this unique capability.[1] - [link to explanation of primary advantage of the annex][2] - [link to demo application on GitHub]</p>
