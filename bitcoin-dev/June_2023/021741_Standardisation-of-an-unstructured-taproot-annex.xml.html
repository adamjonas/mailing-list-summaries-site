    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A conversation between Greg and Joost regarding annex malleability vector and its impact on transactions was shared. In this case, the txid remains identical, while only the wtxid is malleated with annex data stuffed to the maximum transaction size. The issue discussed is where a transaction is denied entry into the mempool because a counter-party decided to put in a strictly worse transaction for miners by bloating the weight of it and not adding fees. This scenario creates a bad trade as there are reasonable methods for mitigating it. An example was given where a transaction with inputs A' and B' signed by two parties A and B, cannot be published because B created and published an alternative version of it with a large annex for input B'. In such a case, miners could accept A's version because its fee rate is higher. However, it was assumed that the user has a direct connection to a miner, ignoring any potential concerns related to p2p transport.</p>
