    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Burak Keceli wrote to Dave explaining a scenario where Bob is the vendor and bitcoins are timelocked. Bob transfers some bitcoins to service provider Sally on the condition that she spends an equal amount of bitcoins minus a fee to Carol. The mechanism already enforces this contingency, so if Carol doesn't receive the bitcoins from Sally, then Sally also doesn't receive the bitcoins from Bob. However, Burak suggests that if the service provider double-spends a transaction that enforces a one-time signature where Bob is the vendor, then Bob can forge the service providerâ€™s signature from the 2-of-2 and can immediately claim his previously-spent vTXO(s). Dave is confused about whether Burak is describing the effect over multiple transfers and asks for clarification. Dave points out that in a private protocol, Carol can't be sure that Bob and Sally are separate individuals. If they're the same entity, then any forfeit that Sally needs to pay Bob is just an internal transfer, not a penalty.</p>
