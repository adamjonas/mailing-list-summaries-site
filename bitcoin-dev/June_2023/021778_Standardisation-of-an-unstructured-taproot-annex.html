    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread, Joost clarified the requirement for an opt-in annex in transactions. The opt-in annex is necessary to ensure that existing multi-party protocols are not affected. Joost explained that every input in a transaction must commit to an annex, even if it is empty. This means that either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent surprises in multi-party transactions. If one signer does not commit to an annex, they can be confident that no version of the transaction will include a potentially large annex added by another signer. Joost also mentioned that for future protocols that rely on the annex, every participant would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, even if it is empty. This empty annex serves as a signal of opt-in.Overall, the opt-in annex requirement aims to maintain the integrity of multi-party protocols and prevent unexpected changes to transactions.</p>
