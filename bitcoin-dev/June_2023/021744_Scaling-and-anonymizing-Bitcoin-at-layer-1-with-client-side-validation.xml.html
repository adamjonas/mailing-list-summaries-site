    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin PoW anchoring proposal has raised concerns among some individuals who are questioning what would happen if a miner spends the current miner single-use-seal while creating a commitment, but makes the PMT only partially available or entirely unavailable. These concerns have been addressed in a white paper available on GitHub, which describes the proposal in detail.However, there is still confusion surrounding how other miners will reach a consensus on whether a protocol reset is required. This issue is similar to mempool contents and makes it difficult for all miners to agree on something like PMT availability. It remains to be seen how this issue will be resolved in the future.</p>
