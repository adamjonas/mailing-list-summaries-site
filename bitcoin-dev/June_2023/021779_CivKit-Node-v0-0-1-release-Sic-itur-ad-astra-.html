    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Proudly announcing the initial release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to create a functional peer-to-peer market board. Written in Rust, this release is still in its raw form and has received interest from individuals looking to contribute code or integrate CivKit into their Nostr and Lightning peer-to-peer market clients. The current release is command-line only and supports basic NIP 01, although it contains bugs and incomplete tasks. It has not been extensively tested on multiple platforms and primarily functions as a local host for various operations.Included in this release is a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node using a gRPC interface. The introduction of this interface lays the foundation for building one or more GUI applications on top, which has been a consistent request from the community.An experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport (thanks to LDK) allows for connecting to another CivKit Node as a peer. The idea behind this integration is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and create a single market for p2p service providers such as watchtowers, state backups, and boards. This approach aims to share the workload between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spam mitigation, secure crypto engineering (e.g., onion routing), and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.Moving forward, the plan is to focus on implementing sound onion routing support and the fundamental NIPs offered by BOLT12, including NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, among others. There are also plans to integrate a notary protocol, such as Mainstay. However, the developers are open to feedback from the community and will prioritize features based on user input. They aim to avoid staying in an "ivory tower" as "purist developers" and instead want to involve the community in the project's product management to ensure they are building for real-world scenarios with unstable and constrained mobile clients.Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are in place, the developers plan to focus on the development of CivKit functionary services themselves. This includes features such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles, as described in the paper. However, they are also open to supporting custom services built on top of CivKit Node, as there is a vast unexplored potential with the maturation of Nostr and Lightning.It is worth noting that peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core around 2010 but were later removed. The decision to remove these features was a wise one as Bitcoin Core has evolved into a complex system, and careful layerization has been one of the key lessons from the history of the internet. Nevertheless, the developers recognize that censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets still remain missing pieces in the Bitcoin protocol stack.The CivKit Node project aims to adhere to the best open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses. The developers welcome anyone who is passionate and willing to contribute to the project.For future announcements, the developers plan to use a dedicated communication channel, such as a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, any innovations in cryptography will aim to be standardized under BIPs.In conclusion, the release of CivKit Node marks an important step towards growing the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies. The developers hope to achieve significant advancements with the help of the community and their dedication to building with passion and love.References:[0] CivKit Node GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/civkit/civkit-node[1]">https://github.com/civkit/civkit-node[1]</a> Bitcoin-dev mailing list announcement: <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021556.html[2]">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021556.html[2]</a> Lightning-dev mailing list discussion on privacy-preserving monetary credentials: <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003964.html[3]">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003964.html[3]</a> Bitcoin Core commit that removed peer-to-peer market features: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab</a></p>
