    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced by the Bitcoin Devs. The release is written in Rust and is currently CLI-only, implementing basic NIP 01 support. However, it is still in its raw form, with bugs and todos that need to be addressed. The release has not been tested on many platforms and primarily functions as a local host. Included in the release is a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The gRPC interface is intended to lay the groundwork for building one or more GUI applications on top, in response to requests from the community. There is an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK, allowing users to connect to another CivKit Node as a peer. The goal is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of peer-to-peer service providers. This will benefit from network law effect by sharing work between Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials. Moving forward, the developers plan to focus on sound onion routing support, fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and integration with a notary protocol such as Mainstay. They are open to feedback from the community and aim to build for the real-world of unstable and constrained mobile clients. The developers also discuss the historical context of peer-to-peer market features in Bitcoin Core and their subsequent removal. They believe that censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets are missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack. All works released under MIT/Apache licenses and adhere to the best open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The developers welcome anyone strongly willing to build with passion and love.</p>
