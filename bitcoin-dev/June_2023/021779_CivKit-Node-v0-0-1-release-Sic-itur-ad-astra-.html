    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. It is written in Rust and is a raw release that has not been extensively tested on multiple platforms. The release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. Despite being full of bugs and todos, it serves as a local host for various functions. A sample Nostr client binary is included for deployment and testing purposes, along with a utility binary to manage the node using a gRPC interface. The interface lays the groundwork for building GUI applications on top, which has been a consistent request from the community.There is an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK, allowing connections between CivKit Nodes as peers. The goal is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and create a single market of p2p service providers. This would enable sharing work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems, including spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.Future plans for CivKit include sound onion routing support, integration of fundamental NIPs, such as NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and more, and integration with a notary protocol like Mainstay. The development of CivKit functionaries services, such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles, will also be pursued. However, the project is open to custom services on top of CivKit Node, as there is potential for exploration with Nostr and Lightning maturation.The announcement reflects on the historical presence of peer-to-peer market features in Bitcoin Core in 2010, which were later removed. The importance of layerization in complex systems like Bitcoin Core is acknowledged, but the need for censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets remains one of the missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack.All works associated with CivKit Node are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and the project aims to adhere to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. Contributions from individuals passionate about building with love and commitment are welcomed.The announcement concludes with a mention of future communication channels for announcements, potentially through a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. The goal is to have cryptography innovations standardized under BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).Overall, the release of CivKit Node marks a significant step toward enhancing the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies, with the potential to facilitate peer-to-peer markets at a larger scale.</p>
