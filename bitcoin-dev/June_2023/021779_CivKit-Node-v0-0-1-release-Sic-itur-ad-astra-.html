    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first release of CivKit Node, a Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. Written in Rust, this initial release is CLI-only and includes basic NIP 01 support. However, it should be noted that the release is raw and may contain bugs and todos. The release has not been extensively tested on various platforms and primarily functions as a local host. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. This interface lays the groundwork for building GUI applications on top, which has been a consistent request from the community. There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. This integration aims to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, providing a single market of p2p service providers. By sharing work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems, such as spamming mitigations, crypto engineering (e.g., onion routing), and privacy-preserving monetary credentials, the network can benefit from network law effect. Future plans for CivKit Node include sound onion routing support, integration with BOLT12, and the development of fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, and NIP-33. Additionally, integration with a notary protocol, such as Mainstay, is being considered. Feedback from the community will play a crucial role in shaping the future development of CivKit Node, as the project aims to build for the real-world of unstable and constrained mobile clients. It is worth noting that the peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core around 2010 but were later removed. The CivKit project sees large-scale peer-to-peer markets as one of the missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack. All works related to CivKit Node are released under MIT/Apache licenses and adhere to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The project welcomes anyone with a strong passion and love for building to contribute. For future announcements, the project plans to establish its own communication channel, such as a new mailing list or an experimental platform on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, the project aims to standardize its cryptographic innovations under BIPs.</p>
