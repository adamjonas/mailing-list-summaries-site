    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Devs have announced the release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to create a functional peer-to-peer market board. The release is written in Rust and is still in its early stages, with bugs and todos that need to be addressed. The current release is CLI-only and has only been tested on a limited number of platforms. A sample Nostr client binary is included for deployment and testing purposes, along with a utility binary to manage the node using a gRPC interface.One of the key goals of CivKit Node is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of peer-to-peer service providers. This integration includes experimental support for BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. The aim is to share the work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems, including spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.Future plans for CivKit Node include sound onion routing support, the implementation of fundamental NIPs (such as NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33), and integration with a notary protocol like Mainstay. Feedback from the community will play a crucial role in shaping the development of the project. The team behind CivKit Node aims to avoid staying in an "ivory tower" and wants to ensure the project meets the needs of real-world unstable and constrained mobile clients.The release of CivKit Node marks a step towards filling one of the missing blocks of the Bitcoin protocol stack - censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets. The team looks forward to growing the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies with CivKit Node, and all works are released under MIT/Apache licenses.For future announcements, the team plans to utilize a dedicated communication channel, such as a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, they aim to standardize their cryptographic innovations under BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).Overall, CivKit Node represents an exciting development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with the potential to significantly expand the capabilities of peer-to-peer markets and contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin and Lightning economies.</p>
