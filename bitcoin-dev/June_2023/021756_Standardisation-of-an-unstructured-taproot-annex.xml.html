    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The taproot annex is currently consensus valid but non-standard, and conversations around standardization are ongoing. A flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format is being considered, but agreeing on an exact format may take time. In the meantime, the proposal is to define any annex that begins with '0' as free-form without additional constraints. This allows developers to utilize the taproot annex immediately without waiting for a structured format. Free-form annexes also offer future flexibility, ensuring options are open for future developments and structure improvements. Non-structured data may require fewer bytes than a probable TLV format, which would necessitate the encoding of length even when there's only a single field. The proposed approach can broaden the utilization scope of the taproot annex while preserving the possibility of transitioning to a more structured format in the future.</p>
