    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In response to John Tromp's question about Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) anchoring, Maxim Orlovsky referred to their paper and specifically the second paragraph of the "Bitcoin PoW Anchoring" section. The paragraph explains that if a party spends current miner single-use-seal without creating a commitment or committing to a header without sufficient PoW, then any party can create a special bitcoin transaction providing publically-identifiable OP_RETURN information about a new miner single-use-seal (protocol reset). However, only the first OP_RETURN announcement which is closed with a proper procedure is considered valid under the consensus rules. John had also asked what would happen if a miner spends the current miner single-use-seal while creating a commitment but makes the Payment Transaction (PMT) only partially available or entirely unavailable. Additionally, he wanted to know how other miners would reach consensus on whether a protocol reset is required since it seems impossible to agree on something like PMT availability (much like mempool contents).</p>
