    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard raised a question about the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, in order to protect existing multi-party protocols. He mentioned that this modification would be necessary for Lightning nodes using Taproot support, as failure to do so would break propagations of their `option_taproot` channel transactions. Greg Sanders requested a citation for this information and expressed his opinion that protocols should not be built on undeveloped upgrade hooks. Antoine also discussed the approach of limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes as a means of protecting opt-in users, and shared a link to a branch implementing this approach. Joost Jager joined the discussion and proposed a set of conditions for an opt-in annex, including the use of TLV format and a limit on the maximum size of the value. However, he noted that the current limit of 126 bytes proposed in another branch would not be sufficient for certain vaults. Joost asked for any remaining practical objections to making the annex standard under these conditions.</p>
