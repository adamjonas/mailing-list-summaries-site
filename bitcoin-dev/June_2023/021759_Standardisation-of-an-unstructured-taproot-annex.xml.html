    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Joost Jager expressed concern about the safety of time-locked vaults and suggested backing up ephemeral signatures on the blockchain to ensure their opening. However, he also noted that without an annex, there is a circular reference problem which makes this process not as secure as it could be. Dave responded by suggesting a scriptpath solution that requires some extra preparation but avoids the issues with using the annex. He also proposed another solution for nearly the same safety without any data being put on the chain. This involves using a widely used decentralized protocol that allows anyone who can prove ownership of a UTXO to store some data. It would provide similar data availability guarantees to committing data on the block chain, but without the permanent footprint.Dave also commented on a potential payload extension attack and suggested that the changes proposed in a pull request regarding transaction replacement by smaller witness could provide a viable solution. He concluded that the two solutions identified above can be implemented immediately while rolling out relay of the annex and witness replacement may take months of review and years for >90% deployment among nodes.</p>
