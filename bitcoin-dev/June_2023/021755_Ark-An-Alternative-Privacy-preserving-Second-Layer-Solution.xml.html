    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue with using one-show signatures as double-spend protection is that miner-claimable fidelity bonds are not effective against adversaries who are both counterparties and miners. In the context of Ark, fidelity bonds refer to the vTXOs which have two possible closures: a key-path collaborative closure and a script-path closure. The former has higher precedence as it can be triggered immediately with a satisfying signature between the rightful owner of the vTXO and the service provider. The latter enables the service provider to sweep funds after a relative lock time. If the service provider double-spends a transaction that enforces a one-time signature, Bob can forge their signature from the 2-of-2 and claim their previously-spent vTXOs. However, if Alice or the service provider is a miner, they won't be able to steal funds since they cannot co-sign from Bob's key.</p>
