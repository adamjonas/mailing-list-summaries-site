    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard expressed confusion regarding opt-in of non-deployed-yet protocols and deployed protocols in response to Joost's point on "Opt-in annex." He questioned if they are talking about the opt-in mechanism just for non-deployed protocols or also for deployed ones like coinjoin/lightning spending P2TR outputs. Antoine discussed the coordination cost of deploying a new policy and how it might be prohibitive or require very long periods. Greg Sanders replied to Antoine's email, requesting a citation because he did not understand his point about Taproot support on the Lightning-side. Greg added that people should not build protocols meant for production on top of undeveloped upgrade hooks. In a later email, Joost Jager suggested a restrictive policy enabling annex-vaults and is in line with work already done, including an opt-in annex, tlv format, allowing only tlv record 0, and limiting maximum size to 256 bytes. However, this limit isn't sufficient for two presigned txes (unvault and emergency) where signatures would take up 2*64=128 bytes.</p>
