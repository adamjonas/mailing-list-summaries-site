    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing the opt-in annex mechanism. He raises concerns about whether this mechanism will affect deployed protocols like pre-signed vaults and coinjoin/lightning spending P2TR outputs. He questions if adding an annex for non-deployed-yet protocols could allow script spend path of a currently deployed protocol to be opted-in to the new annex policy through collaborative added inputs. Greg Sanders responds with concerns around building protocols meant to go into production on top of undeveloped upgrade hooks, while Antoine argues that the use-cases might have legitimate economic weight and require coordination costs. Joost Jager suggests some policies that would enable annex-vaults such as opting in every input even if it is empty, using the TLV format for future extensibility, limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes, and only allowing tlv record 0. They also discuss the limit of 126 bytes mentioned in another pull request, which is not sufficient for these types of vaults. Finally, they agree to think more about the specific TLV format.</p>
