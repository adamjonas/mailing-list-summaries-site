        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the potential benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of a taproot annex design for unstructured data use cases. The annex's improved space efficiency would benefit existing data storage uses that utilize OP_RETURN or inscriptions, as well as applications that would ideally use covenants. However, there are concerns about annex malleability causing longer mining times and griefing issues. It is suggested that instead of using the annex standard, efforts should be focused on fixing annex malleability in a future soft fork.The email conversation also discusses the potential for a taproot annex design for time-locked vaults using presigned transactions signed by an ephemeral key. However, without the annex, due to the described circular reference problem, the vault creation and signature backup cannot be executed in one atomic operation, making it less safe. There are discussions around the standardization of the taproot annex, which is currently consensus valid but non-standard. The proposal is to define any annex that begins with '0' as free-form, without additional constraints, allowing developers to use its features without having to wait for structured formats. There are also concerns about annex malleability vector, which could deceive developers into thinking their transactions are safe from replacement when they may not be. Reasonable methods for mitigating this issue are being discussed. Overall, the conversations highlight the potential benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of a taproot annex design for unstructured data use-cases. It also emphasizes the importance of considering trade-offs when proposing changes and the potential solutions to address concerns about transaction-relay jamming griefing issues.The Taproot annex is a new feature introduced by Taproot that allows developers to include additional data in the SegWit witness of a transaction. In an email conversation, David A. Harding and Joost Jager discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different bitcoin vault protocols. They talked about the on-chain footprint of presigned transactions versus using the annex. The immediate advantages of making the taproot annex available in a non-structured form are clear since it allows developers to use the taproot annex without delay and take advantage of its features today. However, a potential payload extension attack could downgrade the overall transaction feerate, but changes proposed in [3] to allow tx replacement by smaller witness are considered to provide a viable solution.Greg Sanders wants to use annex data with LN-Symmetry but that's dependent on a soft fork of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. Various proposals were suggested to address this issue. The taproot annex could also be beneficial in scenarios that require the emulation of covenants through the use of presigned transactions involving an ephemeral signer. Antoine proposes the adoption of a simple approach to the Taproot annex in order to avoid a potentially long standardization process. The primary advantage of using the annex is that its data isn't included in the calculation of the txid or potential parent commit transaction's txid, making it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. Antoine suggests a two-phase process for a decentralized standardization process of the annex. Regarding the potential payload extension attack, Antoine believes that the changes proposed in [3] to allow tx replacement by smaller witnesses would provide a viable solution. In this email, Joost proposes an idea to make annex usage "opt-in" by requiring all inputs to commit to an annex to be relay-standard. Opting in would enable convenants through pre-signed transactions with atomic on-chain signature backup without needing to worry about non-annex multi-party protocols such as coinjoin and dual-funded lightning that may suffer from annex inflation or the last signer presenting an unexpected annex. However, the downside is that there would be an extra empty annex byte per input, which for some could be a reasonable trade-off.</p>
