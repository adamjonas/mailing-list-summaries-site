    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the potential for annex malleability to mislead developers into believing their transactions are immune to replacement when they might not be, leading to a compromise of assumptions and mirroring the situation with zero-confirmation payments and rbf. The suggestion is made to permit the utilization of the annex without restrictions, inform developers of its risks, and acknowledge that Bitcoin may not be suited for certain types of applications. However, the potential for larger transactions due to annex malleability causing longer mining times is noted as a concern for rare cases where transaction processing software/hardware has limits on size. It is suggested that instead of using the annex standard, efforts should be focused on fixing annex malleability in a future soft fork.</p>
