    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard is seeking clarification on the topic of opt-in annexes in relation to non-deployed and deployed protocols. He questions whether the opt-in mechanism would require adding an annex for non-deployed protocols, as currently, a script spend path of a deployed protocol can be opted-in to a new annex policy through collaborative added inputs. Greg Sanders requests a citation for the claim that people should not build protocols meant for production on undeveloped upgrade hooks. Antoine acknowledges that ideally, premature choices should not encumber future development, but mentions that if certain use cases gain economic weight, the coordination cost of deploying a new policy may be prohibitive. In such cases, he suggests implementing sound and "firewalled" signaling and upgrading mechanisms to deploy new policy rules smoothly. Greg seeks further clarification on Antoine's mention of modifying current Taproot support on the Lightning side, specifically regarding the requirement of all P2TR spends to add an annex and commit to it in the BIP341 signature digest. Antoine explains that this would be a mandatory upgrade for Lightning nodes, as failure to do so would disrupt the propagation of `option_taproot` channel transactions. Antoine also discusses the possibility of introducing a TLV record to limit the maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction. The email thread continues with Joost Jager proposing a restrictive policy for enabling annex-vaults while still aligning with existing work. This policy includes opt-in annexes for every input, the use of TLV format for future extensibility, only allowing unstructured data in tlv record 0 for future extensibility, and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. Joost highlights the need for a larger limit than the current 126 bytes proposed in a previous pull request, as it would not be sufficient for certain vault configurations. He asks if there are any remaining objections to making the annex standard under these conditions. The email conversation concludes with Antoine providing a link to the Bitcoin development mailing list for further discussion.</p>
