    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The CivKit Node has released its first version as a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board, written in Rust. The release is CLI-only and has not been tested on many platforms yet. There is an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, where one can connect to another CivKit Node as a peer, to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and have a single market of p2p service providers. With this release out, they plan to go for sound onion routing support and integrate with a notary protocol, among other things. The project aims to bind to the best open-source development standards as set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and they welcome anyone strongly willing to build with passion and love. Peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core circa 2010 but were removed by Satoshi. The CivKit Node hopes to grow the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies by an order of magnitude or two.</p>
