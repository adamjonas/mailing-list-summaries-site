    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a known contributor to the bitcoin community for several years, has proposed a set of changes to the bitcoin-dev mail list, which he believes lacks clear moderation policies. He suggests that a clear policy must be established and made public after discussion in the mail list. He also proposes that Bryan Bishop, who acted as the moderator for a long time, should be replaced with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against." The role of the moderator(s) must be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences. Additionally, Dr. Orlovsky suggests creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" that will publish all submissions without moderation. He believes that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Dr. Orlovsky cites an incident where his post was not published even though it had already received broad reactions across the bitcoin community. This lack of transparency led him to question whether the post ever got to Bryan Bishop. The conversation over Twitter highlighted the need for explicit moderation or peer-review policies that must be applied on a non-selective basis. If a non-spam email is censored, people interested in auditing bitcoin-dev main mal list non-censorship will notice it and announce it publicly. In such cases, the failing moderator(s) should be removed and replaced.</p>
