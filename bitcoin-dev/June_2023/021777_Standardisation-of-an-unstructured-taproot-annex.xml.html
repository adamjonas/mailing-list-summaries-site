    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joost Jager has explained the primary advantage of the taproot annex as its ability to store data that is not included in the calculation of txid or a potential parent commit transaction's txid. This feature makes it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. The most critical application in this category, according to Joost, involves time-locked vaults. Pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term until proposals such as OP_VAULT are implemented.Backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is an excellent way to ensure that the vault can always be 'opened'. However, without the annex, this is not as safe as it could be. Due to the described circular reference problem, the vault creation and signature backup cannot be executed in one atomic operation. To support the use case of the taproot annex, Joost created a simple demo application that shows how a coin can be spent to a special address from which it can later only move to a pre-defined final destination. The demo uses the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the presigned transaction so that the coin cannot get lost. More advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Joost hopes that this further raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality that the annex uniquely enables.</p>
