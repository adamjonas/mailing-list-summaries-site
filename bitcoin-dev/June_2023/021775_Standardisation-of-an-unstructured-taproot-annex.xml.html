    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing potential changes to the protocol. One proposal is to require every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, in order to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. However, this would require a mandatory upgrade for Lightning nodes that support Taproot, as all P2TR spends must add an annex and commit to it in the BIP341 signature digest. Another approach suggested is to limit the maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction as a TLV record itself in order to protect opt-in users. Additionally, there is a suggestion to use the TLV format from bips #1381 and only allow tlv record 0 for future extensibility. The limit of 126 bytes proposed in a previous pull request was deemed insufficient to accommodate the needs of annex-vaults. The proposed conditions for making the annex standard include opt-in annex, Tlv format, only allowing tlv record 0, and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. The discussion is ongoing, with participants considering practical objections to these proposals.</p>
