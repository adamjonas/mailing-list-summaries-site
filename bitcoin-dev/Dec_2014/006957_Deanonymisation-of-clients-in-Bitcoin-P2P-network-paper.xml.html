    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the effectiveness of connecting to Bitcoin using Tor, Isidor made measurements and found that there is still room for improvement on the DoS handling since the number of connections dropping to near-zero occurs rather frequently. When Gregory mentioned running quite a few nodes exclusively on Tor and not seeing any connection dropping behavior, Isidor asked for more information on what he meant by "running exclusively on Tor" and whether he connects or allows connections through hidden services. Isidor made outbound connections through Tor exit points the only way to connect to Bitcoin and increased the number of allowed outbound connections in order to get more meaningful values. Recently, Isidor observed unusual behavior on specific dates and asked if there was anything he should look into. While Gregory did not find the issue concerning since users choose to abandon their privacy when they directly connect to the Bitcoin network, Isidor believes that this issue is important as there are still attack vectors that make use of the DoS protection deficiencies when running Tor-only, and indirect methods may come with implications for privacy.</p>
