    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sergio Lerner suggested allowing miners to add inputs to the coinbase transaction as a way of voluntarily locking funds. The current coinbase transaction only allows for a pseudo-input. This proposal has been on Lerner's mind since 2011 but hasn't been a priority until now. The reason for the proposal is that in the future, there may be problems with securing the blockchain as the subsidy is lowered. Increasing the number of confirmation blocks would put Bitcoin at a disadvantage compared to other payment networks. By hard-forking now, a soft-fork can be implemented later to any rule involving deposit bonds, proof-of-stake, and penalization of double-mining. Luke suggests coding up a branch that hardforks it in at some far-off block height to have the code ready for testing when/if the time comes.</p>
