    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Will Bickford has expressed an interest in contributing to Bitcoin core development. He uses C++ and Qt daily, loves automating and enhancing software systems, and enjoys root causing and fixing issues. He saw Gavin's call for help with testing during a Reddit AMA and is curious about where he can make the best impact. To get started, he was recommended to take a look at how the current tests are built, read the bitcoin wiki, and join #bitcoin-dev IRC to ask questions. The current tests only scratch the surface of what needs to be tested, so there is plenty of room for improvement in this area. Some automated tests that operate at the Qt level would be interesting, in addition to the current RPC, REST, P2P, and internal unit tests. Travis applies a second level of testing via the bitcoinj-based regression tests. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, responded to Will's inquiry.</p>
