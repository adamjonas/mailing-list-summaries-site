    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, there has been discussion around DNS seeds in the Bitcoin community. Some DNS seeds are being blocked by ISPs because the hosts they pick up often run web servers alongside which serve malware and end up on IP-based malware blacklists. The idea of moving off DNS has come up, but it is not ideal since DNS has a built-in anonymity network where the DNS seed servers only get information about your ISP, not you, and it's cached so you don't get as much information about how many users are making those requests. A potential solution being considered is supporting some subdomain that has results XORed with some constant mask to tweak the real IP. Additionally, a TXT/AAAA/whatever record might be stuffed with a signature of the results provided by the DNSseed operator. In a separate email, Will Bickford expressed his interest in helping with Bitcoin Core development in his spare time. He shared that he uses C++ and Qt daily, loves to automate and enhance software systems, and enjoys root causing and fixing issues. He saw Gavin mention the need for help with testing in a Reddit AMA and is curious about where he can make the best impact.</p>
