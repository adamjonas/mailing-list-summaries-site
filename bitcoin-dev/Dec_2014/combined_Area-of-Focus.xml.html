        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing ways to address the issue of DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs due to the hosts they pick up, which often run malware or other web servers alongside. Despite the desire to maintain DNS because of its built-in anonymity network, there is a need for a potential solution that will prevent ISP's from blocking these seeds. One possible solution is to support some subdomain which has results XORed with some constant mask to tweak the real IP. It may also be helpful to include a TXT/AAAA/whatever record with a signature of the results provided by the DNS seed operator.Furthermore, some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) replace Domain Name System (DNS) results with warning pages if they detect an IP address serving malware. There have been discussions regarding DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs because some of the hosts they pick up run Bitcoin Core nodes alongside malware-serving web servers. It is unclear how ISPs are reading the DNS seed's node list and scanning those IPs for malware before ending up blocking the DNS seed. According to an email sent by Jeremy Spilman on December 20, 2014, it appears that DNSseeds are being blocked because they are being used as dynamic DNS infrastructure for malware sites. This seems to be an automated process that predates the msft no-ip.com issue. Similar problems have also been encountered with the IRC based method originally used by the software.In addition, the problem of mail relay spam blacklisting is discussed, with the suggestion that there is a whole industry selling “semi-snake-oil” blocking solutions to make the internet safer. The solution is to move out of their sights, so that they at least have to specifically target Bitcoin. If they do, it will at least be worth the time spent fixing it.A developer named Will Bickford has expressed an interest in contributing to Bitcoin core development. He uses C++ and Qt daily, loves automating and enhancing software systems, and enjoys root causing and fixing issues. He saw Gavin's call for help with testing during a Reddit AMA and is curious about where he can make the best impact. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, responded to Will's inquiry by recommending that Will take a look at how the current tests are built in src/test, which includes RPC, REST, P2P, internal unit tests, and more. Jeff also suggested operating automated tests at the Qt level and joining #bitcoin-dev IRC to ask questions and read the Bitcoin wiki.Overall, there is a need for improvement in the area of testing for Bitcoin core development. The current tests only scratch the surface of what needs to be tested, so some automated tests that operate at the Qt level would be interesting, in addition to the current RPC, REST, P2P, and internal unit tests. Travis applies a second level of testing via the bitcoinj-based regression tests.</p>
