    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent on December 28, 2014, Mike Hearn expressed concerns over the limitations of DNS as a protocol for learning about the p2p network. The limitations and problems that were hit are not specifically mentioned in the message. However, it is clear that Hearn believes that DNS is not adequate for this purpose. DNS, or the Domain Name System, is a protocol used to translate domain names into IP addresses. It is widely used on the internet to provide users with a way to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names, rather than the more complex IP addresses. However, Hearn's message suggests that DNS may not be sufficient for learning about the p2p network.Hearn's message was sent to Thomas Zander, but it is unclear who else was involved in the discussion. The context of the conversation is also unknown, making it difficult to determine the specific issues that were being discussed. However, the message suggests that there were concerns over the use of DNS in relation to the p2p network.Overall, Hearn's message raises concerns over the limitations of DNS as a protocol for learning about the p2p network. While the specific issues are not detailed, it is clear that further discussion is needed to address these concerns and find alternative solutions.</p>
