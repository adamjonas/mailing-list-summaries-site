        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Will Bickford expressed concern about sifting through 280,000 lines of code in an email exchange dated December 24, 2014. However, it was clarified that only 36kloc of the code in the top level (/src) and libconsensus required skimming. The remaining 170kloc consisted of machine-generated code with translation strings. Gregory Maxwell recommended skimming through all of it, pointing out that it was much more manageable than initially thought. The email thread was titled "In Google We Trust".Bickford has started familiarizing himself with Bitcoin development and the source code, which he estimates to have around 280,000 lines of code. He plans to post regular status updates on his blog at <a href="http://hewo.xedoloh.com/bitcoin-dev/">http://hewo.xedoloh.com/bitcoin-dev/</a> for others who are also getting started with Bitcoin development. Based on a sampling of <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/key.cpp,">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/key.cpp,</a> he would need to devote 110 hours to read the entire code base. Bickford is curious if there is a map of the most important areas to study for new developers and automated test writers. He believes that investing that much time into reading the code base would allow him to accomplish a fair amount of testing. Overall, he is committed to learning as much as he can about Bitcoin development and sharing his progress with others.</p>
