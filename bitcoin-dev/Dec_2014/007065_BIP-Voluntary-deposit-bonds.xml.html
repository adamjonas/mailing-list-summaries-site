    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to allow miners to voluntarily lock funds by adding additional inputs to the coinbase transaction. This would be a hard-fork and could be included in the next hardfork. The code modifications are minimal, involving removing code rather than adding any. The reason for this proposal is to ensure that in the future, when the blockchain is secured and the subsidy is lowered, Bitcoin can still compete with other payment networks without having to increase the number of confirmation blocks. By implementing this hardfork now, a soft-fork can be done later if needed to enforce deposit bonds, proof-of-stake, and penalization of double-mining to prevent short-range attacks.This proposal will not change incentives or security in any way, as adding additional inputs to the coinbase transaction will be voluntary until the time for a soft-fork comes. It is suggested that this change should not be the sole reason for a hard-fork, but could possibly be implemented during the next scheduled hard-fork such as when the block size is increased.</p>
