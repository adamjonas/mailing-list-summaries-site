        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Micropayment channels provide a way for payors to incrementally pay payees by locking a deposit of Bitcoins in a scriptPubKey. Transactions are created every time the payor wants to send more money, and the payee can close the channel by signing the most recent, highest value transaction with their key. With the help of an untrusted hub, any number of parties can send and receive Bitcoins instantly with near-zero transaction fees. Each participant creates one or two micropayment channels with the hub, and multiple hubs can send to each other in a trustless manner.The micropayment hub breaks the linkage between payor and payee with respect to the data available from the blockchain. However, it ties up capital, creating a tradeoff between fees saved and Bitcoins tied up. This hub-and-spoke system is compatible with many embedded consensus schemes like colored coins.</p>
