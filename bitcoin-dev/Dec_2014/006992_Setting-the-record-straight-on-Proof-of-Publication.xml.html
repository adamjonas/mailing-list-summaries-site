    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between odinn and Peter Todd, odinn expressed his belief that Todd was falling into the trap of dismissing certain ideas as inefficient or "scamcoin" without proper consideration. Todd responded by stating that he prefers to make robust arguments, even if he accepts that 95% of what his opponents say is true. He also mentioned his personal opinion that Mastercoin will turn the world on its ear, but he doubts that the successful implementations of the underlying ideas will come from that team. Todd concluded his email with his contact information.</p>
