    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gregory Maxwell and Stephen suggested ways to pay specific miners upon solving a block without risking paying other miners through pay-to-fee. Gregory replied to Sergio Lerner's suggestion of using Gavin's OP_EVAL by saying that it would need an additional change which overlays functionality to actually do something. Stephen proposed a solution through outputs in the coinbase transaction that have nValue == 0, then only applying the COINBASE_MATURITY rule to spending coinbase outputs that have non-zero value. This way, transactions could be made that are only valid after the miner specified solves a block with the coinbase having the same TxID referenced by the new transaction's input. However, this is still a hard fork, but might be easier than allowing the coinbase to spend prevouts.</p>
