    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Proof of Publication is a solution to the double spend problem and comprises Proof-of-receipt, Proof-of-non-publication, and Proof-of-membership. Factom cannot provide Proof of Publication, according to Peter. However, Factom users can know that they are in the audience by accessing Bitcoin Blockchain and Factom's first anchor and network. Proof of receipt is easy for Factom users as Factom publishes a Merkle Root to the Bitcoin Blockchain, and the Merkle proof to the entry proves receipt. The Factom state limits the public keys, and entries not written with those public keys are discounted. Users need to prove publication on their chain and can enumerate their chain without regard to most of the other data in Factom. Peter assumes that the audience for a Factom user should be limited to information found in the blockchain, but the user should have access to Factom if they are a Factom user. If a fork exists in Factom, it can be identified, and no fork exists, proof of the negative is assured. Proof of publication requires detecting forks, and a path can be chosen to move forward; a system that cannot fork does not exist.</p>
