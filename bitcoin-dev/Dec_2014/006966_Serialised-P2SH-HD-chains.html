    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Jeffrey Paul asked about the use case for generating multiple Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) addresses with a single token. He provided an example of a bitcoin URL that requires the payee to operate a server. The user's intention was to enable payments to individuals without the need for them to have their computer on during transactions. The users he targets wish to remain anonymous and not hold any accounts. Jeffrey also queried the assumption that multisig participants would never change their keys or cycle them. The response was that it depends on the framework. Presently miners are limited to using only one address, which cannot be changed even if they wanted to avoid address reuse. The goal is to solve this problem without breaking multisig.</p>
