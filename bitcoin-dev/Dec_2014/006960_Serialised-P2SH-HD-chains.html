    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr inquired about a serialization format that could convey P2SH HD chains, which would be useful for those who want to make recurring payments using a single token that generates numerous P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script. Gavin Andresen responded by stating that the approach seems inadequate because it is crucial to have an expiration date or some means of determining if the payment recipient is still operational. He then referred to a January discussion on extending the payment protocol for recurring transactions and suggested providing a URL where the user can access PaymentRequests when they need to make a payment or possibly offering an array of PaymentRequests for the next X days/months/years of payments.</p>
