    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Will Bickford, Bickford had expressed concern over having to go through 280,000 lines of code. However, Maxwell pointed out that only about 36kloc of that was relevant, with the rest being machine-generated code with translation strings. Maxwell recommended skimming through all of it, pointing out that it was much more manageable than initially thought. The email thread was titled "In Google We Trust".</p>
