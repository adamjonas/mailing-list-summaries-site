    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, a conversation between Peter Todd and odinn is presented. Todd expresses his preference for making robust arguments and accepting that some of his opponents' points may be true while still being correct overall. Odinn mentions Mastercoin and zerocash as examples of developers doing fine work, to which Todd responds that he believes Mastercoin will turn the world on its ear, but he would be surprised if the successful implementations of the underlying ideas come from that team. The context also includes links to abis.io, which is described as a protocol concept for enabling decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and keybase.io/odinn, which appears to be odinn's online profile.</p>
