    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 15, 2014, Jeff Garzik expressed concerns with the current process of producing a “blizzard” of new files and data structures through continuous movement and refactoring. This process complicates the review process and makes it difficult to keep track of where everything is located. Garzik suggested that if the majority of code movement was done upfront, followed by simplifications and data structure work, further patches would be easier to review and apply with less impact on unrelated code. Simply tagging patches as movement-only does not address the problem at hand. The goal is to make the process more friendly for reviewers in order for everyone to benefit.</p>
