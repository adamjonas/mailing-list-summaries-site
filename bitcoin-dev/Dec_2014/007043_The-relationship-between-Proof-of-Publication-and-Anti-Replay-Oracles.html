    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Mark Friedenbach and Peter Todd, the former asks for clarification on Todd's claim that Freimarkets is deliberately insecure. Friedenbach argues that users remain in control of their funds and incentivises miners to mine the host chain, making it secure. However, Todd explains that sybil attacks leading to front-running are considered a security issue by users, and these attacks are incentivised in a distributed blockchain system. Todd also suggests that global ordering of bids and asks is necessary for real businesses using these systems, despite Friedenbach's claim that it is superfluous. The conversation ends with Todd warning against the potential dangers of sybil attacks on the entire system.</p>
