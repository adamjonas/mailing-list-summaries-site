    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on the Bitcoin subreddit expressed confusion over a comment that suggested Tor nodes had been facing connection drops. Another user responded saying that the problem was usually with bootstrapping, as most nodes hardly give any hidden service nodes in their getaddr. The lack of hidden service nodes has been improved in master by including a set of hidden service seed nodes. However, if using Tor with exit nodes, it should be less problematic unless someone manages to DoSban all the exit nodes as described in a paper, which the user has never seen happen. The discussion then moved on to splitting communication between Tor and non-Tor for transaction submission and P2P networking and transaction relay. There was even a pull request about this for Bitcoin Core one. Finally, a user raised concerns about a hypothetical attack where Node A connects to Bitcoin using Tor for submitting transactions and IPv4 for all other communication while Node B strives for direct IPv4 connections with node A and uses them to supply A with additional peer addresses not supplied to any other nodes.</p>
