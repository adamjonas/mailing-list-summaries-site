    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Alex Mizrahi discussed the potential for sidechains and merged-mined chains to be vulnerable to collusion attacks. While some argue that such attacks are unlikely due to powerful factors working against attackers in Bitcoin, sidechains lack these same defenses. However, proof-of-burn systems could incentivize defenders to protect against attacks and allow for a strong response. The use of internal proof-of-burn systems could further increase the incentive to defend the system by allowing tokens to be burned as a true sacrifice of value. Peter Todd contributed to the conversation, mentioning the potential for replace-by-fee-scorched-earth thinking within this context. The conversation also briefly touched on the lack of concrete information from Blockstream regarding the specific uses of merge-mined sidechains.</p>
