    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr asked if anyone was working on a serialization format to convey P2SH HD chains for recurring payments that could be used to generate multiple P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script. He suggested a simple series of tokens, each indicating either an HD chain or literal script content, where all tokens are concatenated to form the P2SH serialized script. A child key would be generated based on the payment number for all HD chains in the data. One possible use case is for a payer to generate additional multisig P2SH addresses without communication with the payee. However, this model presumes that the payee would never want to cycle their own keys or change their cooperating multisig participants' keys, which may not be wise. A better option might be to use a bitcoin URI that points to a payment request generating URL as the canonical "pay me at this address forever QR code."</p>
