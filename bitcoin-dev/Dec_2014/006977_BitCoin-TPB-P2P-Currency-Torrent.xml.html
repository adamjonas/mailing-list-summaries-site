    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message has been trying to understand bitcoin from both a mathematical and programming point of view, and has become curious about using its data package to store useful messages. They propose the idea of creating a peer-to-peer transfer system using bitcoin as currency and data provider, inspired by the recent temporary shutdown of the PirateBay, a service built on open source and freedom to share. The author suggests that by inserting a similar message to that of a torrent into a Bitcoin portion, one could not only tip the person sharing the content but also make an anonymous request for specific content. Micro-transfers would allow users to receive an entry to the content's torrent information. The author invites someone with more practice working with Bitcoin algorithms to develop a front end with them and hopes that others share their vision for a fair and open content world.</p>
