    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer has proposed the idea of burn mining side chains to enable permission-less merge mining for anyone with interest in a side chain. He expressed his surprise on the lack of feedback received on the idea. However, this is not a new idea as it was previously outlined by Peter Todd in a system he called "zookeyv". The discussion started a year and a half ago on #bitcoin-wizards. Todd later wrote up the idea in the context of adding Zerocoin to Bitcoin. He suggests using timelock crypto to defeat miner censorship while ensuring that consensus over all possible parts of the chain can eventually be reached. Proof-of-sacrifice for consensus has several weird properties, but it can improve censorship resistance. Transactions can commit to a nonce in advance and make the selection criteria some function of H(nonce | blockhash) to improve their censorship resistance.</p>
