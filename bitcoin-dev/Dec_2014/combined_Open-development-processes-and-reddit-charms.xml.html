        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Maintaining consistency in column width is a crucial aspect while selecting and enforcing coding standards across the entire codebase. This practice helps to ensure readability and maintainability of the code, making it more accessible for development teams. The article uses Bitcoin Core as a case study for open source development and discusses the challenges involved in understanding its threading model, platform support, libification, dependency management, core data structures, DoS mitigation, script evolution, and scalability roadmap. The lack of code janitors is identified as the biggest systemic risk for Bitcoin, and the article recommends that developers emphasize readability, maintainability, and coding standards while striking a balance between cosmetic patches and non-trivial features.The article also introduces the concept of "social debt", which refers to the added costs incurred by developers who must bear the costs of updating their unmerged work due to constant code movement and refactoring changes. While such changes are necessary for a cleaner codebase, they can discourage developers from working on the tree. The author suggests developing policies that balance the need for refactoring with the needs of developers working on more involved Bitcoin Core projects.The article emphasizes the importance of openness and transparency in open source development and addresses concerns about changes made during the 0.10 development cycle of Bitcoin Core. The author recommends that developers strike a balance between the need for refactoring and the needs of developers working on larger projects. While cosmetic patches are important, developers should prioritize non-trivial features that contribute to the overall functionality of Bitcoin Core.</p>
