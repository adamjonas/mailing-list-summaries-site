    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, posted on the Bitcoin Development mailing list about introducing a rule to make non-standard signatures invalid. Currently, OpenSSL, which is used to verify signatures, accepts more than just the strict DER specification for signatures in Bitcoin transactions. This creates a dependence on OpenSSL, which Bitcoin developers want to avoid. To introduce this new rule, they need to know how many clients are creating non-standard signatures. Wuille monitored all transactions over the past few weeks and found that 9641 of them contained at least one non-standard signature. He also provided a link to the top addresses that were using such transactions. If anyone recognizes these addresses or has an idea of who owns them or what software they are using, they are asked to let Wuille know.</p>
