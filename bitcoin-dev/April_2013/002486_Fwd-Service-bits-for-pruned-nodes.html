    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jeff Garzik and Andy Parkins, the two discussed the most efficient storage format for Bitcoin protocol blocks. Garzik suggested using the format currently used by bitcoind - blocks/blkNNNN.dat for raw data. He argued that it was a generic format supported in multiple applications already. To make it more effective, he suggested adding a small metadata download and serving the raw block files. However, Parkins felt this was too specific to bitcoind's current storage format. Instead, he proposed supporting more bitcoin-protocol-oriented HTTP requests. Parkins' proposal would allow any client to supply the same interface rather than being forced to create blkNNNN.dat on the fly. He suggested using URLs such as <a href="http://bitcoind.example.com/block/BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB,">http://bitcoind.example.com/block/BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB,</a> <a href="http://bitcoind.example.com/tx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,">http://bitcoind.example.com/tx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,</a> <a href="http://bitcoind.example.com/block/oftx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,">http://bitcoind.example.com/block/oftx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,</a> <a href="http://bitcoind.example.com/peers,">http://bitcoind.example.com/peers,</a> and <a href="http://bitcoind.example.com/peer/nnn">http://bitcoind.example.com/peer/nnn</a>. Essentially, this would be block explorer's raw mode but in every bitcoind. Parkins pointed out that the hardest operation for light clients is finding out the block that contains a particular transaction - something that bitcoind already knows.Garzik responded that this was a whole new client interface and went beyond the scope of an efficient HTTP protocol that downloads blocks. He argued that Parkins' proposal was closer to a full P2P rewrite over HTTP or a proxy thereof.</p>
