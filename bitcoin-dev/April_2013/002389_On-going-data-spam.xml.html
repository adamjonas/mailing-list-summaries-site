    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from April 9, 2013, Caleb James DeLisle asked about how anti-virus software would respond to certain streams of bytes sent across a TCP socket or persisted to disk. He suggested contacting an anti-virus company to ask what the smallest amount of data they have a signature on is. Later in the conversation, it was mentioned that the testnet chain had been filled with the EICAR test string, but it had not triggered any AV tools, indicating that most anti-virus software do not scan big binary files of unknown type. In the event that there is a case where AV tools do scan such files, it was suggested that storage scrambling could be implemented. This would involve each node picking a random word and all stored data being XORed with it.</p>
