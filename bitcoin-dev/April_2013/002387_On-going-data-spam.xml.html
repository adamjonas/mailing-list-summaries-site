    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread regarding a proposed patch for Bitcoin, Mike Hearn brought up the issue of backwards compatibility and suggested waiting until the payment protocol work is done before implementing the patch. However, another user pointed out that SatoshiDice would not be affected by the patch as they can deduct enough from incoming bets to make up for lost fees. The user also noted that if the patch is successful, it will send a clear message that Bitcoin is not for microtransactions and could force some users to switch to off-chain transactions or off Bitcoin entirely. The payment protocol was deemed unrelated to this issue.</p>
