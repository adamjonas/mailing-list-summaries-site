    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the discussion revolves around finding the ideal domain name to use for caching content. To keep the network distributed, the existing DNS seed mechanism could be used where a few names would serve random bitcoind's addresses, with :8333 added after the name. This would enhance bitcoind to respond to HTTP and p2p caching could then be used. Jeff Garzik suggests using the current format of bitcoind which is tied too much to the storage format of bitcoind. Andy Parkins suggests adding support for more bitcoin-protocol-oriented HTTP requests, such as block explorer's raw mode in every bitcoind. This would make it easier for light clients to find the block that contains a particular transaction, something that bitcoind already knows. Additionally, support for HTTP POST/PUT of signed transactions and block announcements is suggested by Andy.</p>
