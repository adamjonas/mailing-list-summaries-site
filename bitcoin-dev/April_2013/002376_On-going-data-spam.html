    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Reddit thread discussing data stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, user petertodd mentioned that someone had attempted to upload the entire AMIBIOS source code, but it was deemed unimportant. User TD added that 2.5MB of Wikileaks data and GPG encrypted files had been uploaded, along with hidden wiki cp/jb sections. User jgarzik provided a link to an address where he suspected GPG symmetric key encryption had been used, and claimed to have written a tool to download data. Another user, MC1984_, noted that nothing had been put into the Litecoin chain at all. The comments were made in 2013 by various users, including Jeff Garzik of exMULTI, Inc.</p>
