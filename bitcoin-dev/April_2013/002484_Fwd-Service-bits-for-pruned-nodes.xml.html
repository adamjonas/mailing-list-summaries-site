    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On April 30th, 2013, Jeff Garzik suggested that the format currently used by bitcoind would be suitable for raw data storage. He recommended adding a small metadata download and serving raw block files. However, Dr. Andy Parkins stated that this approach was not generic and too closely tied to the current storage format of bitcoind. Instead, he suggested adding support for more bitcoin-protocol-oriented HTTP requests. This would allow any client to supply the same interface without being forced to create blkNNNN.dat on the fly. Dr. Parkins proposed five different HTTP requests: block, transaction, orphaned transaction, peers, and peer. Essentially, this would create a block explorer's raw mode in every bitcoind, making it easier for light clients to find the block containing a particular transaction. Additionally, Dr. Parkins requested support for HTTP POST/PUT of signed transactions and block announcements.</p>
