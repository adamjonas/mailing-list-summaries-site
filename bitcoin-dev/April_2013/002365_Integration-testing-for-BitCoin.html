    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Adam Ritter, a member of the Bitcoin community, expressed his concerns about the lack of integration tests for Bitcoin. He believed that having these tests would make the code more stable and help in testing attack scenarios, refactoring, and extending the code. Gregory Maxwell, another member of the community, preferred to call these tests system tests. Maxwell shared that they use a system called blocktester, which is based on BitcoinJ implementation and simulates various network scenarios to test the boundaries of different rules of blockchain validation protocol. These tests are run as part of automated tests on every proposed patch to the reference software. Pulltester is used to comment on GitHub requests and produces logs. Additionally, a public secondary test Bitcoin network called Testnet has also been established where anyone can access it by starting the reference software with testnet=1. Most of the testing work has been focused on validating the blockchain behavior because it has serious systemic risk. However, json rpc behavior is also interesting but less important.</p>
