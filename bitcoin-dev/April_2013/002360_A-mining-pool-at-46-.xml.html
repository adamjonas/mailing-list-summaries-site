    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 email exchange, Mike Hearn argued that attacking Bitcoin's network would be self-defeating since it would leave a permanent record and many miners would likely leave the pool. However, Robert raised concerns about detecting such an attack, highlighting that only the source IP that first disseminates the new block can be used to identify which pool did anything. Moreover, if different end miners found the double-spending blocks, they wouldn't know that the pool operator was responsible even if they were monitoring their work. In response, Robert suggested that there's nothing stopping the pool owner from channeling the double-spend blocks through some other previously unknown IP, meaning they wouldn't suffer any reputational damage from doing this repeatedly.</p>
