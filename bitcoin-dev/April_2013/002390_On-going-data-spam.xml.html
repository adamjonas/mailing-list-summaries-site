    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation among Gregory Maxwell and Caleb James DeLisle on the Bitcoin-development mailing list centered around anti-virus software and its impact on Bitcoin's testnet chain. The discussion began with the potential consequences of AV software on web browser caches and its ability to corrupt files. The idea of "lightly frying" contents as a method to prevent corruption was suggested, but it was noted that this would eliminate the use of mmap and sendfile() in the future. Caleb James DeLisle then asked about what AV software might do when certain streams of bytes are sent across the tcp socket or persisted to disk. He suggested contacting an AV company and asking what is the smallest data they have a signature on. Gregory Maxwell responded by testing the testnet chain with the EICAR test string and found that most AV tools do not scan big binary files of unknown types. However, if there is a case where they do, storage scrambling can be implemented where every node picks a random word and all their stored data is xored with it. The thread also includes a link to Precog, a next-generation analytics platform capable of advanced analytics on semi-structured data, and a toolset for data science. Developers can use the toolset for easy data analysis and visualization.</p>
