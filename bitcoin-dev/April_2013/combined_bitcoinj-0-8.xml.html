        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mike Hearn, in a discussion thread, explains that all mails he sends are signed automatically by Gmail using either the gmail.com consumer key or the google.com corporate key. In response to this message, Andy Parkins points out that Hearn didn't sign his email and suggests that it is not yet secure. Bitcoinj 0.8, a Java library for writing Bitcoin applications, has been released with support for both simplified and full verification. This release includes an SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) implementation that is competitive performance-wise with more centralized solutions that rely on custom servers. Wallets based on bitcoinj 0.8 complete first time setup for new users in only a few seconds. The vast bulk of the changes in this release are bug fixes, optimizations, and minor API improvements, including support for encryption of private keys in the wallet using an AES key derived using scrypt. Bloom-filtering capable nodes are now queried for transactions at startup, meaning you can receive payments that weren't confirmed yet even if your wallet wasn't running at the time. Many static analysis warnings have been cleared, and all event listeners except transaction confidence listeners now run unlocked and core objects have been converted to use cycle detecting locks.There are some known issues with the release. Transaction confidence listeners are still run with the wallet lock held, which means it's possible to trigger unexpected lock inversions by doing certain things inside them. The Wallet expects that it can store all transactions in memory, including spent transactions, eg, for rendering in lists and availability during re-orgs. On highly constrained devices like old Android phones, it is possible to run out of RAM if a wallet gets very large. There are some bugs that can cause the wallet to get into an inconsistent state in various rare situations.On Tuesday 09 April 2013, Mike Hearn provided instructions on how to obtain bitcoinj 0.8 from the source git via a secure manner. The instructions are as follows: "check out our source from git and then run *git fetch --all; git checkout **cbbb1a2bf4d1*". However, Dr. Andy Parkins brought up an issue with the security of the message due to Mike Hearn not signing his email.</p>
