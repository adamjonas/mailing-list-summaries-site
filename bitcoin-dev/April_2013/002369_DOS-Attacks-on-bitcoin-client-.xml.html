    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Oliver Egginger, a user of the Bitcoin-qt client version 0.8.1, reported to the developers that sometimes other nodes produce an enormous amount of traffic when using the client. He has not had time to investigate thoroughly yet, but he has noticed the issue. The developers responded by mentioning that many new users have been using the reference client which downloads the whole blockchain from peers, and there currently isn't a throttling mechanism. This can quickly eat up bandwidth, so they recommend trying QoS on your router or using the -nolisten command line flag. With the latter option, you will still relay transactions, just not serve the whole blockchain. A related GitHub issue is also mentioned for more information.</p>
