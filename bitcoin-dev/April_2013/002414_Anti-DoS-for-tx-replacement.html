    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on re-activating the replacement feature on Bitcoin's main network was previously held on forums, with a specific thread linked for reference. However, it is suggested that not all issues related to the feature need to be solved before it can be re-activated on testnet. Developers should be allowed to use and build apps utilizing this feature to demonstrate its usefulness and develop prototypes in parallel. This will help make a case for re-activating it on the main network after necessary work is done. For context, Bitcoin has had the ability to replace transactions in the memory pool since its first release. Non-final transactions, those that have not reached the nLockTime threshold and have at least one input with a sequence number, can be replaced by a newer transaction with the same inputs.</p>
