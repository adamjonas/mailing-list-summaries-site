    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Peter Todd suggested changing the transaction hash algorithm to extend the Merkle tree into the txouts/txins itself to make pruning transactions easier. Currently, pruning cannot take place until every output is spent. However, with the proposed change, it would be possible to prune bit by bit and still serve nodes requesting proof of their UTXO without making things difficult for anyone trying to spend old UTXOs. Jorge Timón liked the idea but wondered if anyone would oppose such a fork. Todd replied that he himself would oppose it due to technical risks involved in implementing UTXO fraud proofs, which are more complex than the entire Bitcoin codebase. He raised concerns about how UTXO fraud proofs could cause an arbitrarily deep re-org.</p>
