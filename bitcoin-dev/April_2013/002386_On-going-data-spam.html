    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik on April 9, 2013, they discussed the issue of uneconomical outputs in Bitcoin transactions. The developers had reached a consensus that such outputs should be made non-standard. However, there was no clear definition of what constitutes an uneconomical output. The proposed patch to address this issue did not have a fixed concept of what is considered uneconomical, but it was deemed acceptable by Hearn. Gavin, another developer, mentioned that there would be backwards compatibility problems with the patch. It was suggested that this issue should wait until the payment protocol work was done. However, Garzik noted that waiting would only be an option if there was already an alternate solution coded and ready for the next version of Bitcoin (0.8.2).</p>
