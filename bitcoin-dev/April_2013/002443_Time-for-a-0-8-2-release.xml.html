    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin developer community has reached a consensus that it is time to release version 0.8.2 of the software. The release will address important bugs, and the aim is to have a final version before May 15th, which is the deadline for a hard fork. Pieter is already looking through the issues list and assistance with testing and debugging is welcome. Gavin Andresen will also be reviewing the issues list and marking any that he thinks need fixing with the '0.8.2' milestone. The community is also looking for translators to help with the new version. However, there is still no basic QA checklist for testing of release candidates, and Gavin has committed to using some of the remaining "Bitcoin Testing Project" bitcoins to reward whoever contributes towards creating one.</p>
