    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Mike Hearn and Pieter about the flexibility of node pruning in Bitcoin is being discussed. Mike suggests that nodes should be able to choose their own ranges to keep rather than having fixed chosen intervals. Pieter agrees and proposes adding new fields to the addr message which would allow every node to advertise the height at which it pruned. However, he acknowledges that propagation speed may be slow with this method due to the number of IPs circulating. He also suggests splitting the responsibilities of "relay/validation" and "serve historic data" and having separate service bits for those. They discuss the behavior of old nodes connecting to new nodes and how immediate disconnection seems like an acceptable behavior if requested data isn't served. Finally, they discuss the use case for NODE_VALIDATE and how it can be combined with NODE_BLOCKS_2016. Overall, the conversation focuses on improving the flexibility and efficiency of node pruning in Bitcoin.</p>
