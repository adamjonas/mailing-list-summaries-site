    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>JW Weatherman proposed a feature to Bitcoin to address the issues with private key reading and writing. He suggested using the NATO phonetic alphabet to display or entertain private keys, indicating lower case by not capitalizing the word, and capital letters and numbers should be capitalized. The use of whole words that are easily distinguishable from a short word database would reduce the likelihood of errors in recovery. The second part of the solution is to insert checksum letters where every 5th word is a checksum for the previous 4 words. This would greatly improve the user experience as it immediately indicates an error within these 5 words if the user accidentally enters a wrong checksum. Additionally, even if an entire word is lost on multiple lines, the checksum would make guessing the correct words relatively easy. JW demonstrated a live demo of using the NATO alphabet and checksums every 4 words, which seems to remove the stress of attempting to write unambiguous characters, making it easier to type with autocomplete when the word dictionary is not involved.</p>
