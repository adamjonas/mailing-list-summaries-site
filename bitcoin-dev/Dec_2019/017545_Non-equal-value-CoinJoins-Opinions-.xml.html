    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the limitations of CoinJoin and ZeroLink protocols in terms of their inability to fully prevent linkage between pre- and post-mix coins, as well as the bloat that arises from multiple rounds with many inputs and outputs per user. The author proposes a new protocol that introduces chaumian reissuable/redenominatable tokens as an intermediary stage between input/output phases, which allows for unequal amounts while retaining the advantages of fixed denominations. This new protocol also includes several subtypes of mixing rounds: decompose, mix, optimize, and combine. In order to preserve exact denomination sizes for mixing transactions, these rounds would need to have their mining fees subsidized and would require batching to alleviate bloat. Finally, the author suggests that this approach can be made size-efficient by keeping low hamming weight outputs virtual, but notes that further work is needed to explore this design space.</p>
