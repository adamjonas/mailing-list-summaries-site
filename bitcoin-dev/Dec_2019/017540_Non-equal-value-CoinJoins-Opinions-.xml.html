    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>CashFusion is a privacy-enhancing technique developed by the Bitcoin Cash community. The research claims that non-equal value coinjoins can be relied on for privacy. It is estimated that there are around 10^92 ways to partition inputs into a list of 10 sets of 10 inputs, but only a tiny fraction will produce the precise output list, which makes it hard to track transactions. With 10^20 possibilities, there is essentially no linkage. The Cash Fusion scheme extends this obfuscation further by allowing players to bring many inputs and have multiple outputs. However, if your math requires that you have "around 1 BTC" outputs per user, equal-valued CoinJoins can be used where the equal-valued outputs are completely unlinked from the inputs. It is possible to transform a CashFusion transaction whose outputs are "around 1 BTC" to a CoinJoin transaction with equal-valued outputs and some change outputs, and vice versa. However, with CashFusion, the value involved is just in a single UTXO, unlike equal-valued CoinJoin, where the equal-valued outputs have zero linkability with inputs.</p>
