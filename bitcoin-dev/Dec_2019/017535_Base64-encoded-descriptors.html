    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is proposing to encode descriptors in a way that makes it easier for users to handle them as one unit. The proposal addresses concerns that users will be unwilling or unable to use descriptors due to their code-like syntax and use of commas, parentheses, and brackets. Base64 encoding was suggested as a possible solution, but some members of the community prefer Bech32, Base58, or Base62 due to their user-friendly characteristics. However, the checksum scheme used by Base58 and Bech32 already exists, while descriptors have their own BCH code for descriptor checksums optimized for their length and character set. This can be repurposed to work with any encoding scheme that is suggested, as long as the encoding's character set is covered by the descriptor checksum character set. Descriptors' checksum character set covers all characters on a standard keyboard, making it suitable for future expansion of descriptors. Further information on the descriptor checksum can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/descriptor.cpp">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/descriptor.cpp</a>#L26</p>
