    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Mike and Isidor centers on the impact of DKIM and PoW/hash-cash in email businesses. Isidor argues that bulk mailing companies invest in destination DKIM toggling to reduce CPU usage, although this may be an issue if it becomes impractical when using Bitcoin over Tor. He also challenges Mike's statement on humans not caring about delays but their source, indicating that users would notice a slow website or mobile wallet and avoid it. In response, Mike suggests that Tor is a separate issue, and notifying users of potential anomalies would be unhelpful since they cannot make actionable decisions. They agree that the solution to a crafty privacy-attacking DoS that tries to make exits useless is not to use Tor at all, while the solution to "the entire Bitcoin network is under attack" is much harder to solve convincingly.</p>
