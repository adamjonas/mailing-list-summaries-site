    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jameson Lopp, a well-known Bitcoin developer, hosts charts of his node's system metrics at <a href="http://statoshi.info/">http://statoshi.info/</a>#/dashboard/db/system-metrics. He notes that the CPU spikes are abnormal as he is making automated RPC calls to query the UTXO set. The bandwidth usage chart for his node can be found at <a href="http://statoshi.info/">http://statoshi.info/</a>#/dashboard/file/default.json?panelId=1&fullscreen. In response to a question on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Melvin Carvalho provided some guidelines for running a full node based on statistics from his own node. According to Carvalho, disk usage for blockchain data is currently around 30GB and may continue to grow slowly. He suggests allocating at least 50GB of disk space for a full node. CPU usage is expected to be minimal after syncing the blockchain. RAM usage may reach up to 1.5 GB after running for a few months. Bandwidth usage averages about 500GB of traffic per month, mostly outgoing.</p>
