    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The recent comment on Github suggests that breaking out the distinct repositories may be a good approach. The question is what would be in a separate repository or repositories. Wladimir, in a response to Mem Wallet's inquiry regarding the goal of 3rd party development of Bitcoin related services and tools, stated that the plan is to provide the consensus functionality as a library, where essential parts that make Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be made available. However, there is no intention to expose *everything* as a library. Wladimir further explained that specialized utility libraries would fill this purpose better and referenced <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/libbase58">https://github.com/bitcoin/libbase58</a> for base58 processing. Meanwhile, a different project broke out stealth and coinjoin as distinct repositories and made them installable using npm. Finally, the message concludes with links to Abis.io, which is a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and a new social good.</p>
