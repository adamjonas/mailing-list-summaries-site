    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Mem Wallet asked if the internal libraries of Bitcoin could be made suitable for third-party development of Bitcoin-related services and tools. In response, Wladimir stated that the plan is to provide the consensus functionality as a library in future versions of Bitcoin, with a basic transaction/script verifier already available in version 0.10. The plan for the next version is to extend this to further utxo set management, with plans also in place to add a library for transaction signing. However, there is no goal to expose everything as a library, particularly wallet- or user interface-related functionality. Specialized utility libraries would serve this purpose better. An off-topic question was also raised regarding the use of picocoin for blockchain analysis, with Oliver seeking opinions on its limitations.</p>
