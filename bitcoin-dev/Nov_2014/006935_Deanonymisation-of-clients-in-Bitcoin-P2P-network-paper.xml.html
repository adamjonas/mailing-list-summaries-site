    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist responded to a query about a paper posted on Reddit that describes how an attacker can de-anonymize clients on the bitcoin network. Though Garzik did not recall being contacted directly, he mentions that the attack has been discussed and relies on a number of conditions. He explains that if a user is over Tor, the attacker will try to kick the machine off Tor, assuming it will fall back to non-Tor. However, this is only true for dual stack nodes which are not 100% anonymous as users operate from their public IP anyway. The link to the paper from the University of Luxembourg was also shared in the email thread.</p>
