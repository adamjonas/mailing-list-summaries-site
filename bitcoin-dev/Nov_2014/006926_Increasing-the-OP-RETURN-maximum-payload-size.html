    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Flavien Charlon, in an email dated November 17, 2014, stated that storing only a hash is insufficient for creating interesting timestamping applications. However, the email recipient responded by stating that storing only a hash is enough for all timestamping applications. If more data needs to be broadcasted, it's considered proof of publication and not timestamping. Unfortunately, many applications use blockchain as a convenient transport mechanism despite not requiring proof of publication, which is highly inefficient and wouldn't scale. This is akin to sending all emails to every existing email address with metadata "to be read by: destination at yourhost.com," which is nonsensical. Finally, the recipient concluded that URLs are unsuitable for blockchain storage.</p>
