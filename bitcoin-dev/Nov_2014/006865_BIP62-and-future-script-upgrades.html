    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a member of the Bitcoin community, expresses his skepticism towards the choice of nVersion==3 and argues that there is no reason to believe that future block.nVersion increases will have anything to do with transactions. He believes that creating such a rule would be counterproductive as it would quickly be broken. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, agrees with Todd's argument and shares his previous experience with bumping tx version due to an increase in block version which resulted in ambiguity. Although Garzik acknowledged the change, he prefers to disconnect TX and block version.</p>
