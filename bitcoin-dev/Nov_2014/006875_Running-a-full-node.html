    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on November 6, 2014, Francis Gaschet expressed his interest in the Bitcoin universe and stated that he had installed bitcoind on his PC to test different things on testnet. He also mentioned that there were only a few full nodes with appropriate resources in France and that the decreasing number of these nodes could pose a risk for Bitcoin in the future. As a result, he was considering setting up a full node for his company which operates a dual homed Internet access and has some capacity to host an HA server in a secured environment.Gaschet requested information on the storage, RAM, and bandwidth resources needed to set up a full node. He believed that the problem would not be the CPU. Additionally, there is a stats script running on this node, which can be accessed through <a href="http://213.165.91.169/">http://213.165.91.169/</a>. Gaschet also shared a link to a forum discussion on bitcointalk.org where more people shared their opinions on this matter.</p>
