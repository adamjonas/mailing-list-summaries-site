        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The "clean stack" requirement in BIP62 makes passing more inputs to a script than necessary illegal. This rule needs an exception for P2SH scripts as the test can only be done after the second stage evaluation. A Pull Request was submitted to clarify this in BIP62. However, the clean-stack rule is incompatible with future P2SH-like constructs which would be very useful if we'd ever want to deploy a "Script 2.0". Any such upgrade would suffer from the same problem as P2SH and require an exception in the clean-stack rule, which - once deployed - is no longer a softfork. Luke suggested on the pull request to not apply this rule on every transaction with nVersion >= 3, which indeed solves the problem. The (non mandatory) BIP62 rules should only apply to transaction with strict nVersion==3, and not to higher ones. Hardforks have a much larger risk which just isn't justified for everything. Especially when it's about introducing a new transaction type that won't be used before the softfork takes place anyway.A better name for the rules was suggested and the interaction of BIP62 with P2SH was clarified. The known hashtypes are required despite not being part of DER. v2 transactions were used instead of v3 transactions, and the optional rules only apply to strict v2, not higher or lower. There may even be circumstances where we need to introduce two different new tx version numbers in a single soft-fork, say because we find an exploit that has two different fixes, each of which breaks something. Transactions can certainly be verified for correctness in a stand-alone fashion outside a block.</p>
