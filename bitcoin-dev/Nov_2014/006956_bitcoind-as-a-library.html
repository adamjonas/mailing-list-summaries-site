    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Btc Drak and Oliver Egginger involves a discussion about C libraries for blockchain analysis. Egginger asks for a C library to operate some block chain analysis for his research project, and provides a link to picocoin's library. In response, Drak suggests MatthewLM's cbitcoin as an alternative option. The original email from Egginger highlights picocoin's ability to parse raw blocks and transactions, while also mentioning their Github repository. In contrast, Drak notes that cbitcoin is a good alternative to picocoin, and mentions its features such as being valgrind-clean, supporting all core and P2P data structures, and being able to parse and index the blockchain. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, signs off the email thread with his contact information and work affiliation at BitPay Inc.</p>
