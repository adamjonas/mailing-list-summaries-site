    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on November 16, 2014, Flavien Charlon asked about the size limit of data that can be embedded as part of an OP_RETURN output. It was revealed that currently, it is limited to 40 bytes, while it was supposed to be 80 bytes initially but got reduced to 40 before the 0.9 release. However, after 9 months, OP_RETURN did not lead to any blockchain catastrophe. Wladimir expressed his agreement and support for increasing OP_RETURN size. He added that he does not care about the actual size since pruning is going to launch soon, and everything is better than UTXO-polluting methods that encode everything into addresses such as now used by cryptograffiti.</p>
