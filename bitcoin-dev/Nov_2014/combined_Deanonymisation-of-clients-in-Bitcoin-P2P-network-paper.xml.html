        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Mistr Bigs and an unknown individual, Mistr Bigs mistakenly believed that a paper discussed unintended ways to obtain IP addresses of clients involved in transactions on the core Bitcoin network. However, the unknown individual corrected Mistr Bigs by stating that if a node is used exclusively via Tor, it effectively doesn't have an IP address. The paper actually discusses fingerprinting approaches that probabilistically connect transactions to hosts that can already be identified by their IPs. Mistr Bigs responded by asking why they were discussing Tor limitations in response to this, since the researchers were deanonymizing transactions from non-Tor connected hosts. The unknown individual explained that if a user does not use Tor or an analogous infrastructure, they can be deanonymized in many different ways. Therefore, making sure that hosts can continually use Tor (or similar systems) should be the higher priority. Regarding the effectiveness of connecting to Bitcoin using Tor, Mistr Bigs mentioned that they noticed the number of connections dropping to near-zero rather frequently. However, the unknown individual stated that they have not seen such connection dropping behavior when running quite a few nodes exclusively on Tor. They asked Mistr Bigs for more information on how they measured this. Additionally, the unknown individual mentioned that although there are lots of things to improve regarding privacy on the Bitcoin network, users being forced off Tor via DOS attacks is not immediately concerning because it's a conscious choice users make to abandon their privacy, and there are other mechanisms available for people to relay their transactions than connecting directly to the Bitcoin network.</p>
