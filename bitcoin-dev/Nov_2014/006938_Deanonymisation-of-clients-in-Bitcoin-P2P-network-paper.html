    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The effectiveness of connecting to Bitcoin using Tor has been measured and it was found that the number of connections dropping to near-zero occurs rather frequently. This suggests that there is still room for improvement in DoS handling. However, a user who runs quite a few nodes exclusively on Tor and charts their connectivity did not observe any such connection dropping behavior. The methodology used to measure this needs to be further discussed. Although there are lots of things to improve regarding DoS handling, the fact that users can be forced off of Tor via DOS attacks does not immediately concern some people. This is because it is a conscious choice that users make to abandon their privacy, and the behavior of the system in this case is known and intentional. There are also other mechanisms available for people to relay their transactions than connecting directly to the Bitcoin network, so their choice isn't just to abandon privacy or not use Bitcoin at all.</p>
