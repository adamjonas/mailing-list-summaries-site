    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 27, 2014, Gregory Maxwell wrote to express that the proposal needed more clarity regarding some suggestions as they were carefully designed out of it. In response, the author agreed that the draft needed work and suggested that writing some actual working examples using code would be more beneficial. The author proposed micropayment channels and a green address-style wallet as possible examples. The author also stated that when they get the chance, they plan to rebase the initial implementation and add a command-line flag to verify CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as an IsStandard() rule for testing purposes. A PGP signature was included in the message.</p>
