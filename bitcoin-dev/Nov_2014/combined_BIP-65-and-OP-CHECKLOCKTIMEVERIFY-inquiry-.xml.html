        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about BIP 65 regarding the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, Richard Moore suggested using an OP_CHECKLOCKTIME to push an OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE onto the stack. However, updating the stack is not soft-fork compatible and would immediately fork the network. Additionally, having an invertible test is also not soft-fork compatible as it could cause older nodes to see it as passing even when it was required for non-forking the network in non-inverted cases. To get non-nullable true/false behavior without these risks, they can have the VERIFY test inside a branch and have the signer provide its falseness as an input to the branch. A useful and powerful mental model is that SCRIPT is not running a program, but instead, the signer is proving to the network that they know inputs that make the program return true. The recommended approach is to use OP_IF OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_ELSE OP_END.Moore also suggested allowing an opcode that would use similar semantics against an item in the stack rather than relying on nLockTime in a transaction. However, this would break existing invariants and make the coins potentially less fungible because they wouldn't be reorg safe. Having locktime validity that is basically monotonic is a useful intentional property.</p>
