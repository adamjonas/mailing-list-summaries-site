        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email author, Richard Moore, questions the use of BIP 65 and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in an email exchange. He suggests using an OP_CHECKLOCKTIME that would push either OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE onto the stack instead of relying on nLockTime in a transaction. This new approach would allow for multiple OP_CHECKLOCKTIME conditions to be included in a single script and could create complicated scripts based on block height and/or block timestamp. However, this approach would break existing invariants and make coins potentially less fungible. Peter Todd suggests that the BIP text needs further clarification in terms of working examples in code such as micropayment channels and greenaddress-style wallets. Gregory Maxwell points out that these suggestions were already carefully designed out of the proposal.In the discussion about making coins potentially less fungible, Flavien Charlon expressed concern that breaking existing invariants could lead to coins being non-reorg safe. However, the idea of coins being reorg safe was challenged as all it takes is a double spend for them to become invalid after a reorg. This means there are already less fungible coins, which is why 6 confirmations are recommended for important payments. A double spend requires an active action, and roughly 1% of blocks are lost to reorganizations by chance. Longer otherwise harmless reorgs, such as those experienced in the past, could forever destroy large chunks of coins if descendants had additional constraints on them. If reorganizations precluded the recovery of many transactions that were valid when placed earlier in the chain, substantial losses could occur. The recommendation of 6 confirmations is just a count, and not a detailed analysis of each coin received to determine its script conditions and vulnerability to irrecoverable loss. Layering violations and transaction validity can depend on arbitrary block data, leading to complications.</p>
