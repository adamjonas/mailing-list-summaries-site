    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When discussing the use of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, Peter Todd suggests that the BIP text needs further clarification. He believes that actual working examples in code would be more helpful, such as micropayment channels and a greenaddress-style wallet. However, Gregory Maxwell points out that these suggestions were already carefully designed out of the proposal. Furthermore, coins are never reorg safe; a double spend in the history of coins is enough for them to become invalid after a reorg. This means that there are already less fungible coins, and it is recommended to wait for 6 confirmations for important payments.</p>
