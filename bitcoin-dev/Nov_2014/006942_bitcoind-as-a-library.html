    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context provided, two minor observations have been made regarding the libbitcoin_common.a library. Firstly, DecodeBase58Check is listed as inline in the header but is not actually inlined, making it both non-present in libbitcoin_common.a and unavailable to other code that would use it as a library. This has been identified as a potential bug. Secondly, the hierarchy of tools within the library is poor/weak, with base58.h being an example of an independent low level math/string library that includes caddress, requiring chainparams and making the whole dependency tree quite involved. The question arises whether there is an intention to strengthen and hierarchicalize the various internal libraries such that they would be suitable for third-party development of bitcoin-related services and tools. It is unclear whether this is a goal or if some other project would have to fill such a role.</p>
