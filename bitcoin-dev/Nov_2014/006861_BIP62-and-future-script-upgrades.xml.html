    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn and Pieter agree that the desire for soft forks sometimes leads to ugly hacks. They also believe that hard forks should be possible when they are useful. However, in practice, hard forks have a much larger risk which is not always justified. For introducing a new transaction type that won't be used before the soft fork takes place, it's not necessary to take the risk of a hard fork. Additionally, hard forks reduce the security model of former full nodes to SPV with respect to the new rules without their knowledge. In conclusion, they suggest being aware of the effects of changes like this to keep the option for doing future soft forks open.</p>
