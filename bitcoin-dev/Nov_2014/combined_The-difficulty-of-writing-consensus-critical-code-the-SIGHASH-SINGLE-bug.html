        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the issue of fixing bugs in Bitcoin and who benefits from not doing so. There is a debate between hard forks and soft forks, with hard forks being cleaner and allowing for solutions not possible with a soft fork but carrying risks similar to a US Constitutional Convention where any rule can be changed. Soft forks have their own risks, including reducing security to SPV levels, but it is a misconception that they always reduce security.Developers suggest scheduling upgrades every two years, studying consensus bugs, and defining a hard fork or a better chain to migrate to. BIP62 aims to make life easier for wallet authors by removing the need to deal with malleability, but for most contract purposes, CTLV would be the better option. Hard forking upgrades of protocols are not done regularly even when there are no consensus problems to worry about.Jean-Pierre Rupp from Haskoin has expressed support for a hard fork to fix consensus bugs in the Bitcoin protocol, believing that the protocol should be documented in a clear and understandable fashion, and that bugs are the enemy which should not be lived with. A process of thoroughly documenting and repairing consensus bugs on a separate branch should be opened, and eventually schedule a hard fork.In discussions on Bitcoin development in 2014, the advantages and disadvantages of hard fork versus soft fork were debated. The idea of separating the consensus code into a "Bitcoin Kernel" project, similar to the Linux Kernel, was suggested. Bitcoin developer, Justus Ranvier, criticized the way Bitcoin Core handles bugs, arguing that fixing bugs in a controlled and managed process is necessary due to extra consensus requirements in Bitcoin. He also suggested forking Bitcoin Core and changing the non-consensus-critical code that implements policy to keep politics in Bitcoin development free from centralized control.Clément Elbaz suggested separating the Bitcoin consensus code into a project similar to the Linux Kernel that could be used by anyone. There are plans to move in this direction with the implementation of a script verification library in version 0.10 of Bitcoin's software, which would be extended to other parts of the consensus by version 0.11 and beyond. The idea of separating the consensus code into a "Bitcoin Kernel" project is being discussed, leaving the implementation of other aspects to applications built with it.The concept of 'bug-for-bug' compatibility is explained, which refers to each version with a bug behaving in the same way. The absence of BIP62 makes many basic contracts unusable, including atomic swaps important for sidechains. However, BIP62 is an insecure way of making contracts secure against malleability as it relies on a "whack-a-mole" approach to security that is insecure if any flaw is missed.Peter Todd advises anyone with money behind an implementation that is doing script verification in code that isn’t Bitcoin Core to rethink that decision. Todd believes that fixing bugs should be done through a planned process and questions who benefits from not fixing bugs in Bitcoin. In an email conversation, Tamas Blummer asked Peter Todd if he saw any chance for forking to work best with a freeze of the consensus code.The writer explains that the difference between hard forks and soft forks is whether or not old nodes are dragged along in a quasi-broken state. Non-miners can easily reject a soft fork by running a node that does so, and the reason to avoid soft forks is purely an engineering tradeoff and not related to being an Evil Centralised Foundation.</p>
