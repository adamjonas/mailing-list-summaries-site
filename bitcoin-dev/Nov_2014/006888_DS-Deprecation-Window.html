    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new section called "Confidence to include tx1" and a subsection called "Deliberate delay attack" have been added to the GitHub repository for dgenr8's out-there project. The section discusses a potential attack on miners under concerted attack, in which a miner excludes any transaction that was first seen less than 30 seconds ago or double spent less than 30 seconds after first seen. According to the post, if a miner were to perform this action, they should expect five of 10,000 nodes to delay their block. Hal Finney responded to the idea, stating that it would need "careful analysis." Tom Harding also commented on the topic, suggesting that it may be possible to quantify and target the risk of including tx1.</p>
