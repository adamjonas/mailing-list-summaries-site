    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Reddit user named Francis GASCHET posted a comment in 2014, stating that he was new to the Bitcoin universe and had installed bitcoind on his PC to test different things on testnet. He also mentioned an article that stated the risk of decreasing number of full nodes with appropriate resources, which were scarce in France. Due to this, he planned to set up a full node for Bitcoin by utilizing his company's dual homed internet access and capacity to host an HA server in a secured environment. He asked for information regarding the storage, RAM, and bandwidth requirements, but he believed that CPU would not be a problem. Thomas Zander replied to this post, directing GASCHET towards a stats script running on a particular node and shared a link - <a href="http://213.165.91.169/">http://213.165.91.169/</a>. He also suggested checking out other people's opinions on the topic, which could be found here: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=760094.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=760094.0</a>. The post is signed off with two links - one to abis.io, which is a protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy, and another to keybase.io/odinn.</p>
