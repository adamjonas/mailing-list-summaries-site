    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, mentioned that the number of connections dropping to near-zero while connecting to Bitcoin using Tor occurs rather frequently. He suggested that there is still room for improvement on the DoS handling. However, another Bitcoin developer, Wladimir, stated that he has not seen such connection dropping behavior and the problem in his experience has always been getting bootstrapped as most nodes hardly give any hidden service nodes in their getaddr. He also added that there are other mechanisms available for people to relay their transactions than connecting directly to the Bitcoin network, so users have a choice to abandon privacy or not use Bitcoin at all. Wladimir suggested splitting transaction submission from normal P2P networking and transaction relay, especially for non-SPV wallets that do not inherently leak any information about their addresses. He mentioned a pull request about this for Bitcoin Core one, which was closed unfairly.</p>
