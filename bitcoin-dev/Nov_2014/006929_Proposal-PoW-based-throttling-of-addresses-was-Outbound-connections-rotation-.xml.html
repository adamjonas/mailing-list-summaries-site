    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>DKIM is a cheap and irrelevant aspect in the email business, according to a former employee. Proof of Work (PoW) was not effective in anti-spamming efforts because it confuses bulk mail and spam. Slow website performance does matter to humans as it can negatively impact revenue. PoW tokens may be useful in a shared toolbox if nodes cannot prioritize connections, but if all users are being PoWd, then it is close to game over. Tor is a separate issue that should be considered separately from the DoS problem. Users generally do not care about technical jargon like peer-to-peer networks or Tor. It is worth considering the DoS problem and Tor separately. The solution to a privacy-attacking DoS attack is to not use Tor at all, while the solution to an attack on the entire Bitcoin network is much harder to solve.</p>
