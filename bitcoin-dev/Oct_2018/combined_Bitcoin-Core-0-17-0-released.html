        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.17.0 has been released, bringing various new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Some of the notable changes include the option to limit block storage and set different options for different networks through a single configuration file. The 'account' API has been replaced with the 'label' API, and compatibility with BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support has been added.The update also includes the introduction of new thread safety annotations, Clang compile-time checking, and enhancements to performance. The release removes the '-blockmaxsize' option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes and discontinues Python 2 support for all test files and tools. Improvements have been made to block and transaction handling, and the option to specify the directory for block storage is now available.Additionally, the Bitcoin Core team has made numerous improvements to the software in recent months, including updates related to build systems, tests and QA, bug fixes, changes to the options dialog, peer table, and send coins dialog to improve readability, and enhancements to performance. Over 50 patches have been submitted in the latest code review, addressing bugs found within the software and updating the testing framework.Bitcoin Core version 0.17.1 has also been released, with changes and improvements such as preventing shared conf files from failing with different available options in different binaries, checking for AVX2 code, as well as AVX, XSAVE, and OS support. Documentation changes have been made, including updates to UNIX documentation and explanations on how to update chainTxData in the release process.In terms of security, Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3 includes a fix for a denial-of-service vulnerability that could have allowed an attacker to crash a network node by flooding it with duplicate transactions. The update also provides credit to individuals who contributed to the project, including translators on Transifex.Bitcoin Core is client software used to mine and operate with bitcoin. The latest version, 0.17.0, has been released for multiple operating systems and platforms. It includes new features such as the addition of an RPC command called "assumesvalid" and a new wallet format called descriptors. The release also includes updates to build instructions for specific operating systems, renaming "OS X" to "macOS," and clarifications on certain aspects of the software.It is important to note that upgrading from older versions may result in memory blow-up during the roll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point, and the GUI may experience visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode. However, the Bitcoin Core team continues to make improvements to the software to enhance performance, security, and usability.</p>
