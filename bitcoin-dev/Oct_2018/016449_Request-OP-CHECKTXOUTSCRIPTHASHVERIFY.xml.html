    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made for a new opcode, OP_CHECKTXOUTSCRIPTHASHVERIFY, which would allow a transaction output to be spendable only in a predetermined manner. The specification of the behavior of the opcode is P2SH-focused and is unusable for SegWit, but there are plans to include OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, which could allow covenants more generally with more complex SCRIPT. For now, the proposed specification of the opcode is as follows: The OP_CHECKTXOUTSCRIPTHASHVERIFY will succeed if either of the below are true for all outputs of the transaction that is spending this SCRIPT: 1. It is a P2WSH whose SegWit version and hash, when concatenated together, are equal to the stack top. 2. It is a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH that is the same as the transaction output being spent. Otherwise, if any output does not match either of the above, this operation will fail. A sample use case for the opcode is presented, where a redeemScript is used to make an output spendable in a predetermined manner. The proposal aims to improve the security of transactions by allowing retroactive invalidation in different and less interactive ways from channels.</p>
