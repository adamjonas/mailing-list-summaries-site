    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a new transaction template that can be used as a cryptographic pseudonym has been submitted by Велеслав. This proposal does not have any consensus changes and is purely for the application layer of Bitcoin. A few comments and questions were raised by Kalle, including why only one input is demanded, why exactly type p2wpkh on input is demanded and why verify "SIZE 32 EQUALVERIFY" on output 2. Kalle also questioned the requirement for a segwit version 0 change output, and asked for clarification on what is considered IsStandard rules and what is nym protocol rules in the specification section. Additionally, Kalle could not find information on what 1-byte-nym_version and 1-byte-nym_use are and how they are used. The proposal can be found on Github and Велеслав thanked the team that supported him in creating this proposal.</p>
