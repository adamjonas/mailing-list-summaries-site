        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new paper suggests a modification to the Proof of Work protocol used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The proposed change would encourage miners to mine solo or join smaller pools instead of joining the largest pools. Currently, centralized pool mining works by a pool operator hosting a full node, generating a block header for the next block, and distributing it to their pool miners to start hashing. Mining share transactions help incentivize miners to mine solo while still retaining the same benefits of receiving a continuous stream of small rewards rather than having to mine an entire block.Mining shares also significantly change how consensus happens on the blockchain. A block header contains the Merkle root which contains the transactions that are in a block. Traditionally the block header is backed by 100% of the mining work by the network, but with mining shares, the block header is only backed by a fraction of the total work, precisely 1 / (X + 1). Where X is the total number of mining share transactions required in each block. It will be common to have multiple competing block headers broadcasted shortly after X amount of mining share transactions have been mined.With more decentralized networks, it makes it more difficult for bad actors to attack the network. Mining share transactions modify the proof of work protocol in a way that changes how blockchain consensus happens. Confirmations also have to be measured differently so that users receiving transactions can accurately figure out how confident they should be that their transaction is final. This proposal will increase the security and integrity of the blockchain network by making it more decentralized.</p>
