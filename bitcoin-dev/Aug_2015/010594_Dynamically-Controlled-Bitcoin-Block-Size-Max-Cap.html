    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Peter Todd and Tom Harding on Aug 21, 2015, discussed the analogy game of car brakes in terms of the Bitcoin network. Todd stated that Pieter Wuille showed that brake cylinders have a fatigue problem, and if used regularly during heavy braking, they can fail and kill someone. Tom countered by saying that the car crashes when the brakes are bad, and the radio is on. He checked the scenario where only the radio is on and found that the car does not crash. In response, Todd asked about the acceptable revenue difference between small (1% hashing power) and large (30% hashing power) miners, what attacks on miners we need to resist, and if his definition of "the brakes are bad" corresponds to normal usage or something unreasonable.</p>
