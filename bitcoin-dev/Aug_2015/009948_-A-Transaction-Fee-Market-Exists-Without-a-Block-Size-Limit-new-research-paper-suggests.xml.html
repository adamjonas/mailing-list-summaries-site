    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Dave Hudson proposes that better modeling could lead to more accurate predictions of the "typical" propagation characteristics by measuring the deviation from the expected distribution. The paper uses a single time value as a function of block size for its propagation model, and adding complexity by modeling the propagation distribution would likely have little effect on the outcome. Peter R suggests that miners who build on their own blocks may orphan two blocks in a row, but it is unnecessary to consider anything beyond one block in the future. The discussion then shifts to whether larger block makers will have an advantage over smaller counterparts, but it is unclear if this will be the case. The paper concludes that per/kb fees and spam costs for the immediate future (8MB) will not change significantly, but these fees will increase with bigger blocks. Additionally, the paper mentions the bitcoin exchange rate as a factor in relation to block size, noting that a spam attack is much more expensive in fiat terms today than it was years ago.</p>
