    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Ahmed Zsales responds to comments made by Adam Back regarding privacy concerns in Bitcoin transactions. Ahmed explains that anonymity is not something they would compromise, and they have no desire to create tools that analyze specific details of individual transactions, but rather aggregate data that can be useful for businesses to plan inventory, marketing budgets, logistics, and more. Ahmed provides examples in petrol purchases and remittances where aggregated data from Bitcoin transactions could help small businesses access global, national, and regional industry data figures typically reserved for large businesses due to high costs of acquiring or commissioning research. Ahmed also suggests using the block chain ledger as a valuable database to fund Bitcoin's security infrastructure and growing bandwidth challenges. Adam Back expresses confusion about the proposed monetization model, which he believes conflicts with fungibility and planned Bitcoin improvements, and suggests that policy relating to identity for authorization should take place at the payment protocol layer. Despite these concerns, Ahmed welcomes feedback on the proposal and indicates that technical content will increase in due course and discussion content will be removed.</p>
