    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Sergio has proposed a solution to prove ownership of blockchain through asymmetric-time functions. He also mentions his work on a transaction system (DAGCoin) which relies on proof-of-work per transactions rather than blocks. The draft will be sent to Hector for analysis or may be published altogether. Meanwhile, Tamas Blummer responds to Jameson Lopp's idea about the incentives for running a node in Bitcoin. He acknowledges the indirect incentives such as having a local copy of the validated blockchain data and supporting the network. In a heterogenous environment, validating oneself becomes more valuable, especially during hard forks. Pooled mining became possible due to the homogenous nature of the network.</p>
