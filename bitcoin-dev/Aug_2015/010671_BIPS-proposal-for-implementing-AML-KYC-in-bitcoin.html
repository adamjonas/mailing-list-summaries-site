    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 27, 2015, a person named Prabhat sought a solution to the issue of tracking criminals using Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, who was one of the core developers of Bitcoin, replied that organizations like Coin Center work on high-level policy issues and competent law enforcement organizations are perfectly capable of tracking down criminals using traditional investigative techniques. He added that given how many "dark markets" have either disappeared or been taken down, it seems they are correct. The email also included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed of any content.</p>
