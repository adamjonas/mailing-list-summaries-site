    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion between members of the Bitcoin Core project took place in August 2015 regarding a website that shows a chart of approvals about various BIPs. Nicolas Dorier created the website, which allows contributors to fill out whether they approve or not and provide comments. The aim was to help the community and encourage more people to contribute to the project. However, some members were concerned about getting PGP keys from contributors who had them scattered all over the place. Eric Lombrozo suggested that everyone who has contributed any commits to the project should have a say in this matter. The discussion also touched on improving the readability of the website by grouping core developers under a separate column called "Technical Opinion." Members suggested adding more developers, big miners, and other important figures, such as Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlie Lee, and Mike Hearn. Some members sent their PGP public key, and others asked where they could find these keys. The conversation took place via email and BTC Talk, and the website was available on Azurewebsites.net and GitHub.</p>
