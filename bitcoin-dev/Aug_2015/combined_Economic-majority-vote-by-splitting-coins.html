        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The economic majority in Bitcoin is defined as the will of those who actually use it as a payment system, not just the miners. Measuring miner votes is easy while gauging the economic majority is not so simple. However, colored coins could be used to compare the relative value of two forks. Contracts could be added with a soft fork like P2SH, allowing the output to be spent on multiple forks, preserving the value on each until the deadline. Anyone proposing a hard fork can create a new fork id and release software that implements the hard fork by a certain deadline without requiring a miner vote. After the deadline, core will allow conversion of outputs that pay to the core fork-id to be converted into unencumbered outputs. Users can convert legacy bitcoin into fork-bitcoins and core-bitcoins in advance of the fork, making it possible for exchanges to support trading between them. The side that trades with the most value is supported by the economic majority. Users who want to use the losing rules are free to do so, but the economic majority will have made its decision. Odinn expresses skepticism about the feasibility of utilizing a proposal involving a BIP and a soft fork, as the proposal assumes that many wallets would support or recognize encumbered coins, even if not all of them do. However, users would still be able to move their coins around, but only those trading between XT and Core would need wallets that support it. By consolidating BTC-Core and BTC-XT into a single output, the user can convert it back to a normal output. The purpose of this proposal is to offer a sneak preview and show which choice will give the highest BTC value.</p>
