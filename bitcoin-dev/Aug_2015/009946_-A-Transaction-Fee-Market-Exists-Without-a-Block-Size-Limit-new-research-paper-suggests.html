    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Peter R and Dave discuss Peter's paper and its analysis of the orphan rate in Bitcoin mining. Dave raises concerns about equation 4 and suggests that the model would be stronger if it analyzed how the orphan rate changes with a miner's proportion of the network hash rate. Peter agrees and notes that the paper briefly discussed miner-dependent propagation times. Dave also suggests exploring the risk of orphaning for different miners and how larger block makers can create larger blocks than smaller ones. They agree that it is an interesting problem and that a revised version of the paper could assess the impact of simplified models. The author of the Organ-of-Corti blog is mentioned, who believes that the Poisson process model used in the paper may not be accurate. Peter and Dave express interest in further exploring these topics and look forward to the revised version of the paper.</p>
