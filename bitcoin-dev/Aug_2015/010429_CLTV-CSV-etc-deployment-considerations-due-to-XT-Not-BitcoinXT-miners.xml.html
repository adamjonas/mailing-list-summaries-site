    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tier Nolan and Mark Friedenbach discuss the use of nVersion bits to signal support for a specific upgrade fork in the Bitcoin protocol. They propose using nVersion & 0x8 to signal support while keeping the consensus rule as nVersion >= 4. However, Nolan raises concerns about conflicting upgrades and the need to reject blocks with versions lower than 8 if the new upgrade is accepted by a majority of nodes. They also discuss the possibility of using a specific version-bits proposal to handle upgrades, with a suggested standard already proposed in sipa's gist. The proposal involves reserving bits for feature upgrade forks, agreeing on a specific standard, and moving on. Additionally, they suggest a time window during which the new bit would be active before being permanently implemented, giving software and users time to upgrade.</p>
