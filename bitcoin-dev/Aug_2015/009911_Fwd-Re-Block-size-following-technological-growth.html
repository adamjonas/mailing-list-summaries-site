    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the issue of centralization in Bitcoin mining and the need for testing data for BIP101. The original email by Pieter Wuille mentions the centralized nature of mining as a problem, to which Gavin Andresen asks why it's a problem. Venzen Khaosan argues that this is a big problem for Bitcoin and development has not frozen at some point in the past. He suggests miners are still users who have guaranteed coinbase and only when they start proving themselves useful in a free floating fee market absent coinbase subsidy, then the topic can be revisited. Later, Gavin Andresen mentions that as Bitcoin grows, pieces of the ecosystem will specialize and Satoshi's original code did everything but that is changing, and that is okay. Venzen Khaosan requests for XT 8MB hard-fork testing data that was mentioned for BIP100. The email thread ends with Benjamin Franklin's quote about learning from being ignorant.</p>
