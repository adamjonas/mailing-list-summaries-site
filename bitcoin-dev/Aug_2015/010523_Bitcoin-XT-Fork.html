    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin XT, a proposed implementation of the BIP 101 protocol, has been referred to as an attack on the Bitcoin network. The published implementation of BIP 101 is available on the BIP 101 page and the only text in the Implementation section is a link for <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341</a> which is closed by Gavin. There have been months of public discussion leading up to the authoring of BIP 101, both on this mailing list and elsewhere. The implementation for BIP 101 was submitted to Bitcoin Core as a pull request, to invoke the code review process and some minor code layout suggestions were made by Cory and incorporated. Peter Todd mentioned that there was no chance it'd ever be accepted "due to a number of BIP-level issues in addition to debate about the patch itself." No further review was done on BIP 101 since issues were identified and they didn't get fixed. Bitcoin XT has been hyped as a solution to some of the scaling issues with Bitcoin, but many are hoping that consensus will be reached on one of the following solutions as shown at <a href="http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/">http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/</a> before XT achieves its goals.</p>
