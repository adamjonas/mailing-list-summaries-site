    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between two individuals, Eric and an unnamed author, revolves around the debate over Bitcoin's block size. The author defends their article by stating that they have done their best to represent the top arguments made about the issue, but linking to a clear statement of what Bitcoin Core thinks is difficult as there isn't one. Some people believe that the block size should increase, while others think it should stay at 1mb forever or migrate to Lightning. The author disagrees with the notion that only a few people should be allowed to edit the most important parts of Bitcoin as it goes against its open-source nature. They argue that consensus cannot be "all or nothing" as it would give certain individuals too much power to hold the community to ransom.</p>
