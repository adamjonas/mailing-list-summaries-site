    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer, a bitcoin software developer and entrepreneur, welcomed the declared focus on usability of BitcoinXT. He also believes that there is room for non-consensus relevant P2P protocol flavors that cannot be accommodated by a single code base. Blummer thinks that Bitcoin needs to evolve even if there are conflicting educated opinions. As such, he would be glad to participate in a review process that serves decision-making. In response to Blummer's post, Adam Back asked whether he found BIP 101, BIP 102, BIP 103, and the flexcap proposal deserving of equal consideration. Back also invited Blummer to participate in the BIP review process and attend the workshop on Bitcoin scaling recently announced. Blummer commended Mike and Gavin for creating a choice for fellow entrepreneurs with the BitcoinXT manifesto, which should resonate with many.</p>
