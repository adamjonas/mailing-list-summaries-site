    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, the writer expresses their perspective on block size increase and their opposition to XT. They mention that they would like to see a block size increase in the context of something like BIP 100. The writer also addresses the question of whether they would continue with bitcoin if XT prevails, saying that they would fight it as long as possible and never use it themselves. The email also includes a message from Oliver Egginger via bitcoin-dev, who discusses BitPay's support for BIP 101 and the subject of research on Bitcoin. Egginger suggests that further research on the current protocol version is important and hopes that the current block chain survives, albeit at a lower level with fewer users. He also poses several questions about the possibility of continuing with the old protocol version if XT prevails, including whether there are enough people to support the old nodes and whether developers would fork a Bitcoin client for supporting the old nodes with security updates.</p>
