    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille expressed concern over the centralization of Bitcoin mining, stating that the mining landscape is "very centralized" and that there appears to be a majority relying on agreements to trust each other's announced blocks without validation. Gavin Andresen responded with a statement questioning why this was a problem and asserting that the current system is still "incredibly interesting". He also stated that as Bitcoin grows, different pieces of the ecosystem will specialize and Satoshi's original code, which did everything from hashing to consensus and network, will change. Venzen Khaosan also weighed in on the discussion, calling for facts and testing rather than rhetoric.</p>
