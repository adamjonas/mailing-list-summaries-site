    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a notion that no one else is reckless enough to bypass the review process, which the author wants to kill. The author explains that there were months of public discussion leading up to the authoring of BIP 101 and it was submitted for review via the normal process. Jeff Garzik specifically called out Gavin on Twitter and thanked him for following the process. Other than few minor typo fixes and a comment by sipa, there was no other review offered. The implementation for BIP 101 was submitted to Bitcoin Core as a pull request to invoke the code review process. There were some minor code layout suggestions made by Cory and incorporated, but Peter said there was no chance it would ever be accepted and no further review was done. The entire Bitcoin Core BIP process was followed to the letter, resulting in bugs in the implementation of BIP 101. These bugs were found when Gavin submitted the code to the XT community review process, which resulted in actual peer review. There was much discussion of technical details on the XT mailing list that Bitcoin Core entirely ignored.</p>
