    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and Gavin Andresen, the latter expressed his views on the market-determined minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction. He stated that if one is willing to wait indefinitely, the minimum fee would always be zero or negligible, making the question irrelevant. In terms of block size increase proposals, Andresen believes there should be a criterion, and he has proposed a 20MB limit for transaction volume that requires more than a cluster of computers or ordinary broadband bandwidth. However, he does not think that all block size increase proposals should justify their size. The maximum block size rule currently serves to prevent trivial denial-of-service attacks, but it has little effect on mining centralization. If the limit were removed entirely, it is possible that few organizations or individuals would run full nodes.</p>
