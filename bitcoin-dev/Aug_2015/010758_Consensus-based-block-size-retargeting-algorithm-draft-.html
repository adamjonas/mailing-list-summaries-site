    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, a user expressed concern regarding the ability of miners to control block size limits and the potential for mining centralization. They suggest that implementing a "voting on a lower limit" may be a solution. The user argues that it is not urgent, but there is uncertainty regarding the future of Bitcoin's maximum block size. They suggest that the most important criterion when changing the block size maximum rule should be mining centralization rather than the level of minimum fees. The user proposes using scientific processes to find out what the relation between the two actually is if there's any relationship at all. They also suggest that if the community can't agree on this, there will be a schism hardfork eventually or those who aren't concerned with mining centralization start their own altcoin.</p>
