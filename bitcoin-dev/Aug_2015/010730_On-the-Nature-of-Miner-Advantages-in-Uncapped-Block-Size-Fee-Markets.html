    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion of a paper by Peter R, it was noted that the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols were being ignored. Large miners already have their own network to relay blocks around the globe with only a few bytes on the wire at block-time, and there is also the bitcoinrelaynetwork.org network, which does the same for smaller miners, albeit with slightly less efficiency. Transaction validation time upon receiving a block can be easily made negligible, thus reducing the increased orphan risk for including a transaction to a very tiny amount. Daniele Pinna submitted a paper analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. The paper shows that large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increasing of marginal profits as hashrates grow. Additionally, part of the large advantage the large miners have today is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class which has access to expected profits an order of magnitude larger than everyone else. As block subsidies decrease, this high-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit structure which decreases as a function of hashrate. Daniele looks forward to reigniting consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101) which, due to the XT fork drama, he believes has been placed hastily and undeservedly on the chopping block.</p>
