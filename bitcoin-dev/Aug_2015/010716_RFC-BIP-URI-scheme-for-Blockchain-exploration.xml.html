    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion on the Bitcoin Developer mailing list regarding the creation of a standard URI scheme for blockchain exploration. The proposal suggests using the blockchain: URI scheme to enable users to handle requests for details about blocks, transactions, and addresses with their preferred tool. However, there were concerns raised about the original suggestion violating the URI spec. It was suggested that instead of using "blockhash", "txid", "block" or "address" as host names, the more correct approach would be to use the opaque URI which is blockchain:? followed by the specific query. The proposal recommends two changes: first, using a real URI scheme (blockchain://) to allow for normal URL parsing libraries. Second, including the type looking up in the URI so that it is more human understandable while giving explorers the ability to optimize what they are looking for when hitting various databases. The BIP also proposed the possibility of blockchain://tx/123000/4 for block height, tx index, or blockchain://version which would return a list of supported paths, version of the BIP supported, etc.The BIP should also specify little endian searching. One suggestion was made for another related BIP that specifies what the return results should look like. The proposal concludes that using this scheme will enable wallet developers to simply make blockchain: links without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer, and that Blockchain explorers will offer to handle the blockchain: URI. Users will also benefit from the convenience of being able to use their preferred explorer. The URI syntax RFC was provided as a reference.</p>
