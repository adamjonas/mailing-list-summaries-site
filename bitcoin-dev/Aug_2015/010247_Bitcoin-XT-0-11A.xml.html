    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn announced the release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A which includes the bigger blocks patch set. In his message, he states that a fork is the only way to fix things due to the fact that the Bitcoin Core project has drifted so far from the principles that many feel are important. He goes on to say that forking is a natural thing in the open source community and that often in forks, people say there was insufficient communication. To ensure everything is crystal clear he wrote a blog post and a kind of "manifesto" to describe why this is happening and how XT plans to be different from Core. The article makes no attempt to be neutral and explains things from their point of view.However, Eric replied back to the email expressing his disappointment towards Mike as he misrepresents many cogent, well thought out positions from a great number of people who have published and posted a number of articles detailing and explaining in-depth technical concerns. Eric also points out that equating the fork of an open source project with a fork of a cryptoledger is completely bogus and that there’s a lot of other people's money at stake. Consensus is all or nothing and the fact that a good number of the people most intimately familiar with the inner workings of Satoshi’s invention do not believe doing this is a good idea should give Mike pause. Eric asks Mike, as a civilized human being, to stop using Bitcoin as his own political football for the sake of Bitcoin and for his own sake. Despite his obvious technical abilities, he's discrediting himself and hurting his own reputation.</p>
