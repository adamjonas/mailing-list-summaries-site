    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 28, 2015, Pieter Todd proposed to deploy CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY via the IsSuperMajority mechanism. He opened a pull-req, which was the final step towards CLTV deployment on mainnet. Pieter had copied the logic and tests from the previous BIP66 (DERSIG) soft-fork line-by-line for ease of review. He requested any code review applicable to BIP66 should also be applicable to BIP65. On the other hand, Peter Todd had proposed earlier that he would write the code using the same thresholds as BIP66 in case there were no objections. Later on, he gave the ACK on merging using IsSuperMajority.</p>
