    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 19th, 2015, Ken Friece via bitcoin-dev expressed his opinion on the idea of Not-BitcoinXT in an email. He argued that it was a "really terrible idea" because Mike had proven time and time again that he would not back down or blink. Friece believed that the chances of Not-BitcoinXT gaining 25% of the hashrate were pretty much nil, and as a result, all it would do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and put more people on the losing side of the fork.However, if 25% or more of the hashpower were against XT, Not-BitcoinXT could become an important weapon for them. And while some may have dismissed it as a bad idea, it had the potential to shake the market. The email ended with a non-text attachment, which was a digital signature in the form of an OpenPGP file.</p>
