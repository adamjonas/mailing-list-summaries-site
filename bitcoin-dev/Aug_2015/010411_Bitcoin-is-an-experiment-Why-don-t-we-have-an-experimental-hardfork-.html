    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list proposed an experimental hardfork to increase block size. The objective of the experiment was to show that consensus could be reached for such a hardfork and to collect data for future hardforks. The proposal suggested a slight increase in block size to make it less controversial but also meaningful, with a suggestion of 1.5MB. There was disagreement about the timing of the hardfork, with some proposing June 2016, while others suggested it should be scheduled at least a year after deployment. The proposal argued that four months was already double the grace period for the BIP50 hardfork, which was forked off after two months due to non-upgrading full nodes. It was suggested that softforks were not necessarily safer than hardforks, as shown by the recent BIP66 fork. Many people won't update until they must do so, making the difference between four months and one year minimal.</p>
