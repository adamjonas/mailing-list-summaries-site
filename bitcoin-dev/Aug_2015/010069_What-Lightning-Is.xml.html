    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context consists of an email conversation between several individuals on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. One member, Hector Chu, expresses concerns about the increasing cost of the network as it becomes more interconnected. Another member, Patrick Strateman, replies and explains that a hub essentially swaps funds between payment channels, with the entire business centered around having payment channels open with other hubs/users. Strateman argues that if the hub requires user funds to open these channels, then the users have no reason to pay the hub anything in fees. Tom Harding also chimes in, predicting that hubs will assess fees for depositing funds, based on the amount deposited and the length of time it stays there. In response to a previous message, which was not directed towards him, Patrick apologizes for any confusion caused by Gmail hiding previous messages including sender names. The email conversation continues with members discussing the role of hubs in facilitating payments between merchants and users and the potential for fees associated with depositing funds. Overall, the conversation is focused on understanding the mechanics and potential drawbacks of payment channels within the bitcoin network.</p>
