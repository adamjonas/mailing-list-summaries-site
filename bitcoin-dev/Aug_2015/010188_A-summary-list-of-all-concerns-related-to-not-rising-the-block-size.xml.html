    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concerns regarding rising fees in Bitcoin can be classified into two main groups according to a post on Reddit. The first group includes potential indirect consequences of the rise in fees, such as the unreliability of currently free transactions and migration of users to competing systems with lower fees. The second group consists of software problems that are independent of concrete block size and need to be solved anyway, which are often specific to Bitcoin Core. These problems include an unbounded mempool size that can cause the program to crash by using too much memory, and no good way to increase transaction fees without double spending, which is blocked by most nodes following Bitcoin Core's default policy. The author invites readers to suggest more concerns for these categories and other categories that they think may exist.</p>
