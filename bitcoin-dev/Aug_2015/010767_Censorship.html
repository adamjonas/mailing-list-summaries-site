    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of centralization on popular Bitcoin forums like Reddit and Bitcointalk has become a major concern for the community. A few anonymous individuals control these forums and have the power to manipulate discussions, ban users, alter reputation and facilitate scammers. Protecting the decentralized spirit of the Bitcoin community is no longer a priority for those in charge, who have even claimed that centralization is necessary. In fact, allegations without evidence posted by those in charge have caused more harm to reputations than scammers. The centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is discouraging newbies, intellectuals, and businessmen from joining and could lead to government intervention due to the forums' centralized nature. To combat this issue, a decentralized forum is being created with no rules or bans and where it will be impossible to delete anything, even if attacked by the NSA. This forum is being developed as a passion project with zero profit motive.</p>
