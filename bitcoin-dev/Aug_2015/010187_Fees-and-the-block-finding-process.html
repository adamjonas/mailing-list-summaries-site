    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Zander and Jorge Timón, Timón expresses frustration at not receiving a direct answer to his question regarding the potential consequences of rising fees in relation to block size. Zander denies dodging the question and insists he has been trying to provide straight answers. Timón suggests that those who are avoiding the question may be doing so to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and polarize the discussion. Zander encourages Timón to keep an open mind and try to understand the perspectives of others.Timón lists two potential problem groups related to rising fees: indirect consequences and software problems independent of block size. He believes there may be more problem groups but does not see the point in repeating his question if he is not receiving a straight answer. Zander acknowledges that the issue needs to be solved regardless of block size and agrees with Timón's classification of the concern under group 2.</p>
