    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the libbitcoin mailing list, Jorge Timón, shared his encounter with Amir Taaki during a Spanish hack meeting. Timón discussed some of Taaki's concerns with Bitcoin Core and named two individuals: Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen. Hearn had proposed a blacklisting scheme for Bitcoin, which Timón disagreed with, believing that other developers would not accept such changes in Bitcoin-qt. On the other hand, Timón thought Andresen could be trusted despite visiting the CIA, although he was overly conservative about some changes in Bitcoin. Upon reflection, Timón realized that his initial thoughts on Andresen were wrong, and his concerns were not exaggerated at all. Taaki was also worried about the payment protocol, but they agreed to disagree on that matter. Timón shared this anecdote as a curious piece of information rather than an argument of authority. Some members suggested that the conversation might be better suited for Reddit instead of the mailing list.</p>
