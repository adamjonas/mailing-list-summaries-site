    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach raised concerns about miners having the authority to vote on block size and gave feedback that giving them unrestricted power goes against Bitcoin's security model. The user who proposed the voting-only scheme stated that introducing a hard cap on block size would solve this problem. Under their proposal, miners could increase or decrease block size within defined parameters, but only through collective agreement. They also suggested an initial upper limit of 8MB for block size and presented an alternative methodology where miners pay extra difficulty to create a larger block, and every 2016 blocks calculate the average or median of the last 2016 blocks to set the new maximum block size limit. This approach still requires an upper block size limit to ensure full node oversight control over miners. The idea is to raise the block size hard limit while making a softer or inner limit part of consensus.</p>
