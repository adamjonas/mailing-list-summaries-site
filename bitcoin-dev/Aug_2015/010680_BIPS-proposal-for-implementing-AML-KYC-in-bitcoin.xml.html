    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. government responsible for executing economic and trade sanctions in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. KYC, which means "Know Your Customer," is an essential practice that every intelligent businessman does when his deals are significant. AML stands for "Anti-Money-Laundering," which some people consider to be overreaching. Neomoney states that money laundering encompasses a wide range of activities undertaken by innocent participants in the economy. The authorities' growing expectation of a right to violate our privacy to enforce their laws, and an expectation that we do nothing to protect ourselves from that violation of privacy, lie at the heart of money laundering propaganda. The writer believes that the work of someone who writes about OFAC, KYC, and AML comes across as someone who has been duped into doing the bidding of the largest and most successful criminal organization on Earth.</p>
