    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 21, 2015, odinn via bitcoin-dev posted a message asking if anyone had visualizations of votes regarding various BIPs. He specifically requested pie graphs showing what percentage of miners were voting for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, and BIP sipa based on what was published in blocks. The post included a link to a website that covered how developers felt about the various BIPs. However, odinn wanted to see a visualization that described miner voting visually in real time. The post was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation. No further information was provided in the post.</p>
