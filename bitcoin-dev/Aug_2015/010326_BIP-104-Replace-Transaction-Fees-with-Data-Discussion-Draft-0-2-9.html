    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about adding more data to a Bitcoin transaction, which would fill blocks faster. However, the person being addressed is skeptical of this idea as it would force people to choose between paying a transaction fee or including data about the transaction. They argue that this would violate users' privacy, which is one of the primary reasons people use Bitcoin. Additionally, they point out that the data would be on the blockchain, so there would be no reason for anyone to pay miners for it.The person also questions why anyone would want to change the Bitcoin license from MIT to something else. They believe that this proposal is unrealistic and would not work for Bitcoin. They suggest that it might be better suited for a different cryptocurrency where people are more willing to accept such changes. Finally, they warn that moving away from the MIT license would cause conflicts that would make Bitcoin unusable by many organizations.</p>
