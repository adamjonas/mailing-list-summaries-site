    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 15, 2015, an email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list by someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. In the email, Nakamoto expressed concerns about the release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A and the potential for a dangerous fork in the cryptocurrency. He stated that the developers behind Bitcoin XT were violating the original vision of Bitcoin by not achieving near unanimous agreement on changes to the consensus rules. Nakamoto also acknowledged that new knowledge had been gained since he created Bitcoin, and that making it a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties was a non-trivial problem. He concluded his email by stating that if two developers could succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, then he would have no choice but to declare the project a failure.Some members of the bitcoin-dev community questioned whether the email was actually from Nakamoto or if it was a hoax. One user suggested that the email's sender copy and paste their message to a different website to verify their identity. Another user pointed out that Nakamoto's account on Vistomail had been compromised, which could explain why the email appeared to come from a different address than usual.</p>
