        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The possibility of intentionally causing a split in a blockchain was discussed in emails between Gregory Maxwell and another individual. While it is possible to intentionally split coins between separate forks, there seems to be little incentive for anyone to do so since the coins would no longer be fungible across the chains and would thus be worth less. However, new coins and fees would be issued on both chains, which could lead to difficulty in avoiding this fact. Transactions that are associated with one chain only can exist exclusively on that chain, and someone with single-chain coins can pay small amounts to many users to get their wallets to consume them and make more transactions single chain-only. Hector Chu pointed out in a bitcoin-dev email thread that there is no connection between transactions and the blocks they appear in. The blockchain serves the purpose of resolving any potential conflicting transactions by providing a globally agreed total ordering as soon as one of the forks accepts a different transaction in a conflicting set. A split occurs when transactions exist on one chain but cannot exist on the other due to the acceptance of different transactions in a conflicting set. One can intentionally produce such a split to separate the existence of their coins onto the separate forks, just like performing a reorg-and-respend attack on a single blockchain. New coins and fees are issued on both chains, becoming spendable after 100 blocks, and any transaction spending them can exist exclusively on one chain.Regarding migration of miners to the bigger chain, Hector Chu used an example where he could release a version of the software programmed to reassign ownership of a million of the earliest created unmoved coins to him at block 400k and then make a transaction to pay 5 coin/block in fees. In this situation, it may pay more in fees, but whether miners would move to this chain remains uncertain. However, it was suggested that miners would migrate to the chain with higher profits due to a higher volume of fees. The migration remark was deemed an oversimplification, as demonstrated by the hypothetical scenario of someone releasing software programmed to reassign ownership of a million unmoved coins to themselves at a certain block and then making transactions to pay high fees. In this case, miners may not move over immediately as they would need to see the new chain gain acceptance through higher trading volume.The discussion surrounding the potential fork of the blockchain due to larger blocks has not addressed what will happen when it occurs, according to a post on a forum. The writer believes that the issue is not as significant as some suggest because transactions on the smaller chain can still appear on the larger chain, and there is nothing tying transactions to the blocks they appear in. However, miners are likely to move to the larger chain to seek higher profits due to increased fees. To prevent this from occurring, the serialized format of transactions on the smaller chain would need to be changed so that signatures are no longer valid across chains. It has been suggested that the losing chain would have its coins sold down, but selling off the smaller chainâ€™s coins in the short term is not advisable as these transactions will still appear on the larger chain.</p>
