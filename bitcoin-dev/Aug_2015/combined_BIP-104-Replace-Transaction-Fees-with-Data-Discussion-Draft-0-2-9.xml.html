        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the proposal of a long-term solution to replace mining rewards and transaction fees. Ahmed Zsales proposed BIP [104], a discussion draft for feedback. However, Btc Drak noted that bip numbers cannot be assigned by individuals and must follow the format of "BIP-myproposal." Angel Leon confirmed that privacy issues were covered in the proposal. The conversation also raises the question of whether increasing block size would allow for more transactions per block, resulting in more fees being collected and costs being spread out among many more users, ultimately keeping transaction fees low. On the other hand, there are concerns that by increasing block sizes, transaction fees may not be available to supplement mining revenue for those who do not have access to cheap or free power to mine. Additionally, the proposal and concerns surrounding block size highlight ongoing discussions about the future of Bitcoin's economic model.The conversation is also about adding more data to a Bitcoin transaction, which would fill blocks faster. However, the person being addressed is skeptical of this idea as it would force people to choose between paying a transaction fee or including data about the transaction. They argue that this would violate users' privacy, which is one of the primary reasons people use Bitcoin. Additionally, they point out that the data would be on the blockchain, so there would be no reason for anyone to pay miners for it. The speaker thinks that this idea won't be accepted by the Bitcoin community because it can potentially make Bitcoin the most Orwellian money ever and goes against proposals like CoinJoin.Furthermore, the conversation questions why anyone would want to change the Bitcoin license from MIT to something else. The person believes that this proposal is unrealistic and would not work for Bitcoin. They suggest that it might be better suited for a different cryptocurrency where people are more willing to accept such changes. Finally, they warn that moving away from the MIT license would cause conflicts that would make Bitcoin unusable by many organizations.In addition, Peter Todd made a public remark on Twitter about the BIP [104] proposal, adding the term "data mining" to its title. While the remark was likely meant to be disparaging, Ahmed Zsales thanked Peter Todd for his contribution. It is ironic that Peter Todd posted the remark on Twitter, where messages are aggregated and sold to data miners. Twitter made $48 million from selling data to data miners in 2014, with a 95% year-on-year growth rate. Twitter has since spent $130 million on buying a data mining business in order to further grow this part of their business. This side of their business is one of their more profitable areas.</p>
