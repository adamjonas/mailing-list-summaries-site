        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation in this email exchange centers around the time value of Bitcoin, mining fees and the potential for lightning network transactions. The first part of the conversation discusses how selling Bitcoin for fiat currency is a way to increase net worth in real terms but only works if the interest rate on the fiat account is greater than the price rise in Bitcoin over the same term. If people are sitting on their coins hoping they appreciate, they have a time-value of Bitcoin of zero, meaning that there is no real return on investment. The second part of the conversation explores the idea that it's not clear what amount of security miners need to receive in order to secure the network, with some arguing that transaction fees will need to reward miners at some point. The block reward pays for Bitcoin transactions and fees are effectively zero right up until the day the block reward goes away entirely. The lightning network offers three potential benefits over on-chain transactions: lower fees, shorter confirmation times, and no ongoing costs once the channel is closed. The third part of the conversation discusses the potential downsides of off-chain transactions through the lightning network, namely that lightning transactions will have to pay for several things including blockchain fees for opening/closing the channel, the time value of funds being used to keep the channels open, and the maintenance costs of hardware/software to run a lightning channel. At some point, blockchain transactions will be cheaper than lightning network transactions. However, nodes in the lightning network will pay whatever level of transaction fees is needed to make the blockchain work, which could be $0/txn, 1c/txn or $50/txn.</p>
