    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 19, 2015, Eric Lombrozo discussed the importance of separating the consensus code from commit policies in Bitcoin development. He called for clear communication of this difference to laypeople and criticized XT opponents for their inability to do so. Lombrozo stated that progress was being made towards this goal through the creation of libconsensus. Once completed, he explained that Bitcoin Core would be just another implementation rather than the specification of consensus rules, which has caused issues such as the block size debate.</p>
