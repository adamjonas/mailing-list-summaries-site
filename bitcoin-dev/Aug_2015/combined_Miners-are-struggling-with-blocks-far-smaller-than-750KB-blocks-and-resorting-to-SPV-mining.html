        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers are concerned about the bandwidth and validating capacity of the global mining network. Despite having all incentives, miners are struggling to download and validate small blocks. Empty blocks have been mined by several different pools, even with preceding blocks as small as 50KB. This has raised concerns about the global mining network's bandwidth and validating capacity.If miners continue to SPV mine for a whole minute, a single malicious miner could mine an invalid block on purpose and let these pools SPV mine on top of them while it mines a valid block free of their competition. This could lead to reorgs and many block orphans for anyone not running a full node. This would be especially problematic in the XT world where Mike wants everyone to be running SPV nodes.The mining hardware and software itself may be at fault, leading to suspicion that the mining codes are bad or miners are being lazy. The situation has been described as "grim" as it could lead to disastrous consequences for the mining centralization, which is already too centralized today. There is a need for representatives of these pools to comment on why this is happening and whether they are on Matt's relay network. It has been found that even miners are facing difficulty in downloading and validating smaller blocks. The author believes that nodes are capable of handling larger blocks but there is no incentive to run them. Unless miners are intentionally mining empty blocks, which does not make sense, this issue needs to be addressed.</p>
