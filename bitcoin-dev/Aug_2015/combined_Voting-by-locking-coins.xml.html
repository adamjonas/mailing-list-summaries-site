        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The possibility of using locked coins for casting votes on an issue is discussed in an email conversation and a proposal made by John Dillon is highlighted. The proposal suggests that individuals who want to cast a vote must lock their coins until the vote closes, using CLTV, with the weight of the vote increasing based on the number of coins locked. Nodes would tally up the coin values for various vote options on the date the vote closes, with the choice having the highest total being declared the winner. The proposal also suggests that the voting could be a rolling one, with the next vote starting when the present vote is decided. Peter Todd responds to Hector Chu's question about John Dillon's proposal, explaining that the proposal aims to have the economic majority give miners permission to raise the blocksize. The writer suggests that a vote which is free can easily be bought and manipulated, making it harder to determine the true consensus. In order to make the vote more accurate, the cost of the vote should be proportional to its weight. There may need to be weighting depending on how long the coins have been locked for, to prevent voting at the last minute from having an undue influence. While the solution may not solve the block size issue, it could offer choices such as keeping the block size the same, reducing it by 10%, or increasing it by 10%. Overall, the proposal outlines a system for allowing users to vote on proposals related to the block size limit by placing their coins into a specific script that can only be spent after a certain block height.</p>
