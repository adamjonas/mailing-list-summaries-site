    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on supporting side or alt-chains in BIP70, a payment protocol for bitcoin, has been taking place among developers. A possible solution suggested is the bip44 coin type registry, which allows for an optional coin type field to be added to PaymentRequest and serializing incompatible PaymentDetails to the serialized_payment_details field. However, issues related to human-meaningful identifiers and name collisions have been raised, with one developer suggesting that the genesis hash could be used as an alternative to short names. The differences between alts derived from BTC versus those developed differently, such as BCN and its alts, are also noted. A visualization tool, Map of Coins, has been provided to further illustrate the differences between various alt-coins.</p>
