    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, Hector Chu asked whether the Lightning Network is limited in the number of hops there can be in the payment channel. Joseph Poon replied that the hops are limited to the time-value which the sender wishes to pay and the minimum acceptable timeout between each hop, adding that the time between hops should be somewhat long as the intermediate steps can be extended further when you want to offload the HTLCs to others who have a channel open with both counterparties. Poon also stated that 1-day is used as a convenience. Â Hector Chu asked another question regarding the Lightning Network. If any of the parties along the channel has a problem, it is assumed that the balances can always be settled on the blockchain. However, what if the fee on the settlement transactions is not high enough to enter the blockchain? Do the fees always have to assume worst case scenarios on the Bitcoin fee market? Joseph Poon responded that the fees should not be any different than how one would send coins if they wanted to send funds below the current IsStandard value.</p>
