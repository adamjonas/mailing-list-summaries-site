    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An email thread on Bitcoin-dev discussed the possibility of scheduling an experimental hardfork to settle the debate on how, when, how much and how fast the block size should be raised. One of the main objectives of this proposal would be to show the world that reaching consensus for a Bitcoin hardfork is possible. It was also suggested that a slight increase in block size could collect data for future hardforks. However, there are already many well-tested hardfork proposals out there that do not require any change in the maximum block size. Furthermore, it was noted that a consensus on the timing of the hardfork has not been reached yet, with some suggesting that it should be scheduled at least a year after it is deployed in the newest versions rather than June 2016 as previously suggested.</p>
