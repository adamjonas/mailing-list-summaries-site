    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated August 18, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. expressed confusion over Oliver's position regarding Satoshi's potential return to Bitcoin development. Oliver clarified that he personally had no objection to the creator's involvement and believed that most people would welcome him back. However, Oliver initially thought the email from Satoshi was fake and now believes that it may be best not to know for certain whether or not it was indeed from Satoshi. Oliver emphasized the importance of unanimity in the Bitcoin community and stated that if a vast majority did not support a fork, then it should be avoided until a consensus is reached. He acknowledged the likelihood of a fork occurring but warned that it would result in a lot of humiliated individuals on both sides, leading to bitterness. Overall, Oliver stressed the need for unity and avoiding actions that could cause division within the Bitcoin community.</p>
