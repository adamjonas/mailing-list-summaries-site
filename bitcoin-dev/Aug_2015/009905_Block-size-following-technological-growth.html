    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, a discussion about the optimal size for Bitcoin's blocks is taking place. Jorge Tim√≥n questions why 8MB is considered safe but not 9MB. The response is that 9MB would be safe too, but there is no need to increase the conflict unnecessarily. One user argues that there has been no fact-based information regarding the safety of 8MB or any other block size. He suggests that demand will fill whatever block size is set and that the unique selling point of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. To maintain this, the capacity supply doesn't have to be increased on demand. Instead, it should be based on science and reason rather than profit motive or democratic lobbying.</p>
