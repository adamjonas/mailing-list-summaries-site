        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin XT has a feature that poses a privacy risk for its users. The feature, which downloads Tor IP addresses for blacklisting by default, is not clearly described and has a switch name which intentionally downplays what it does. This poses considerable privacy implications as it is easily bypassed and provides no protection. Even when using a proxy or onlynet=tor, connections are still made over clearnet, thereby leaking the node's real location and identity. Observers can use this information to correlate the location and identity of persons running Bitcoin nodes.Denial of service attacks can also be used to crash interesting nodes and force them to restart and make new requests to the blacklist endpoint via the clearnet while their P2P connections are made through a proxy. Requests to the blacklisting URL also use a custom Bitcoin XT user agent, making users distinct from other internet traffic if access to the endpoint logs is available. Gregory Maxwell removed the last "call home" feature in pull-req #5161, replacing previous calls to getmyip.com-type services with a local peer request. Mike Hearn's original pull-req did not include the proxy disable code, which was added later in master.Peter Todd wrote a message on bitcoin-dev in August 2015, outlining the privacy problem with Bitcoin XT's automatic Tor exit node list download. He noted that it was not a bug, but rather a feature of the software and that these concerns were raised when Bitcoin Core rejected the submission in favor of a more generic approach that avoided being explicitly punitive towards the use of Tor and lacked privacy problems. Despite this issue, he noted that Bitcoin XT was still an improvement over the first implementation as it did not completely block the node once it filled up for the first time.In the XT project, the code was peer-reviewed and other revisions were not submitted to Core as they were already rejected. Mike Hearn mentioned that the code was peer-reviewed in the XT project, but he did not submit any revisions to Core as it had already been rejected. Todd further explained that these concerns were raised when Bitcoin Core rejected the submission in favor of a more generic approach that avoided being explicitly punitive towards the use of Tor and lacked privacy problems.It is worth noting that the thread contains a large number of incorrect statements, which is quite ridiculous.</p>
