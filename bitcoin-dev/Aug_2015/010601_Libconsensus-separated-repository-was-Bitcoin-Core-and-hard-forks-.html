    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposes to separate the BIP process into several distinct areas, including consensus rule change proposals, update/deployment mechanisms for rule changes, specific hard fork proposals, specific soft fork proposals, peer policies, RPC, and everything else. The author believes that modularization is essential to resolving serious political challenges in Bitcoin development. However, Bitcoin lacks a standards process separate from updates to one specific reference implementation. The author suggests taking a step back from implementation hackery and specifying some core protocol layers, focusing on interfaces, such as a consensus layer that doesn't try to specify networking, storage, wallets, UI, etc. The author also notes that there are many use cases for distributed ledgers beyond Bitcoin's focus on a single use case. For mainstream adoption, enterprises need to be onboard too, and they want code that is not only high quality but is easy to maintain with a development team with high attrition. The author plans to interface with external storage by passing a function pointer to it and prefers not to see function pointers again.</p>
