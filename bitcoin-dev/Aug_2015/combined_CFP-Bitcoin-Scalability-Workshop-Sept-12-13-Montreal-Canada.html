        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin development community is organizing a pair of workshops to aid the technical consensus building process and improve the scalability and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network. The first workshop, scheduled for September 12th-13th, 2015 in Montreal, Canada, will focus on evaluating tradeoffs and requirements for proposals to scale Bitcoin beyond its current limits. The purpose of this workshop is to raise awareness of the complex issues involved, encourage further research and testing of existing proposals, and motivate future work in this area.The second workshop, tentatively planned for late November to December in Hong Kong, will specifically address block size proposals and compare different competing proposals with experimental data. This workshop aims to present and review actual proposals for scaling Bitcoin against the requirements identified in the first workshop. Both workshops will be live-streamed, and remote participation will be facilitated via IRC for online discussions and questions.Registration for the Montreal workshop begins on August 12th, with an early-bird ticket price of $150 USD until September 3rd. Independent or academic researchers can apply for travel assistance to cover airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to give a presentation. The four underwriters of the event will jointly review applications and provide the travel subsidies for qualified presenters. Sponsors are still being accepted for the workshops.The workshops aim to facilitate the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) process and gather technical criteria, evaluate proposals, and analyze data with academic discipline and analysis. Travel, venue details, and accommodation recommendations can be found at scalingbitcoin.org. If anyone has research relevant to Bitcoin scalability, their proposal for a presentation at the Montreal workshop would be welcomed.</p>
