        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the email expresses a desire to see a visualization depicting the percentage of votes for various proposals like BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB and BIP sipa, based on what is published in blocks. He mentions his willingness to display the pie chart on BIPxDevs if such a vote existed. However, there is no standard way for miners to informally vote for the BIPs they support, making it difficult to create the desired visualization.Nicolas Dorier, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, suggests a visualization that shows the percentage of votes for proposals in pie graphs. He was interested in a visual comparison of competing proposals such as BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, and BIP sipa. However, there is no standard way for miners to informally vote on the BIP they support. When asked about formal votes, he wondered if it would be possible for them to appear in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks.In conclusion, the author of the email and Nicolas Dorier are both interested in a visualization depicting the percentage of votes for various proposals, but there is currently no standard way for miners to informally vote for their preferred BIPs. Nicolas Dorier suggests a visualization that shows the percentage of votes for proposals in pie graphs and wonders if formal votes could be included in a pie chart as they become apparent in blocks.</p>
