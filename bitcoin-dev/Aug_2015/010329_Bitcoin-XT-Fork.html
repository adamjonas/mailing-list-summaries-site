    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A technical analysis of the original Satoshi email, which announced Bitcoin, was shared in a pastebin a few days ago. The email actually originated from vistomail's server and was not spoofed. The email headers show that it came from an authorized sender for the email. However, it is still possible that the account was hacked or commandeered. The email was not signed with any PGP keys, although there are several listed on key servers for him. Therefore, the authenticity of the email cannot be outright dismissed as it comes from an authentic source.</p>
