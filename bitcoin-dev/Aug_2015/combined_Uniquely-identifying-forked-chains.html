        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In August 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the use of hash of hashes to identify blockchains. The proposal was made to use either the genesis block hash or a combination of the genesis block hash and block hashes of fork points to identify chains. This would allow for the identification of blockchain forks that are built upon the same genesis block. The proposer argued that it is inevitable that multiple chains will coexist and be actively mined at some point.The proposal suggests extending BIP99's section on schism hardforks to include this method of identifying blockchains. By using the hash of hashes, it would be possible to support forks of varying degrees, including forks of forks and forks of forks of forks, while still maintaining a fixed length chain identifier. This approach would also avoid hurting bystander users who may not be able to distinguish between different currencies or chains.While some may view this proposal as redundant, the proposer emphasized the importance of building systems redundantly to prevent potential issues that may arise from relying solely on the genesis block hash. In times where multiple chains are coexisting and actively mined, users can utilize this method to specifically identify a chain. Alternatively, if a user wants to specify "whatever chain is the longest with PoW," they can use the genesis block hash for a new chain.Overall, the discussion on identifying blockchains for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 and other relevant needs highlighted the limitations of using only the genesis block hash and proposed a more comprehensive approach using a hash of hashes. This method would provide support for various types of forks while preserving a fixed length chain identifier, ultimately allowing for the coexistence and active mining of multiple chains.</p>
