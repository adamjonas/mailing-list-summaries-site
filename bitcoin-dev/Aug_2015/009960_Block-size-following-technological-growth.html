    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on August 6, 2015, Gavin Andresen addressed questions about Bitcoin fees and block size limits. In response to a question about when it would be a good time to let fees rise above zero, Andresen pointed out that fees were already above zero and referred to an article on his website that debunked the myth of not full blocks. When asked about what size would be too dangerous for centralization, Andresen linked to another article he had written that argued more transactions do not necessarily mean more centralization. Finally, in response to a question about removing the consensus rule that limits mining centralization, Andresen stated that he did not believe the maximum block size had much to do with mining centralization and thus did not accept the premise of the question.</p>
