    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown individual, Todd mentions that he tested a scenario where only the radio is on in a car and found that the car did not crash. The conversation then shifts to the topic of revenue difference between small and large miners in relation to variance reduction techniques such as p2pool and pooled-solo mode, with the unknown individual asking for an acceptable revenue difference between the two. They also discuss the types of attacks on miners that need to be resisted, such as DoS attacks and hacking. However, it is noted that none of this discussion is within the scope of Pieter's simulation. It is suggested that if this casts doubt on the conclusions drawn from Todd's testing, then it also casts doubt on the original conclusions as well.</p>
