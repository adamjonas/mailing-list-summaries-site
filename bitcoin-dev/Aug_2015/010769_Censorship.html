    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The sender of the original message is discussing the creation of a truly decentralized forum where users can share their uncensored opinions and ideas without fear of censorship. The forum will exist on thousands of computers, making it impossible to destroy, and users will be able to create their own sub-forums built on the system. The sender mentions that they will release rudimentary external software/website so people can post and read what's posted, and that there will be various leaders who will utilize the program and organize quality forums. They also mention that they started the project to create a journal of uncensored scientific research but realized it could be useful for everyone. The sender recognizes the difficulty in creating a truly censorship-resistant forum, but believes that the centralization and censorship in the current Bitcoin community are inhibiting its growth and scaring away intellectuals, businessmen, and newbies just getting started. The sender suggests a heavily moderated, real community forum that receives an "official seal of approval" from top XT people.</p>
