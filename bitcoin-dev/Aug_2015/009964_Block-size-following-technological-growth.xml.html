    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A conversation between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón dated August 6, 2015, has been presented where Timón posed some questions to Andresen. The first question was about the market minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction and when it would be a good time to allow fees to rise above zero. Andresen responded that average fees are influenced by wallet and policy defaults and that the current market minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction is zero. The second question was about the criterion that Andresen had to reject a proposed size. Andresen did not have any automatic or other criteria that could result in him saying no to a proposed size. The third question was whether Andresen would be in favor of removing the consensus rule that limits mining centralization by imposing an artificial block size maximum. Andresen does not believe that the maximum block size has much to do with mining centralization and denies that the consensus block size maximum limits centralization at all.</p>
