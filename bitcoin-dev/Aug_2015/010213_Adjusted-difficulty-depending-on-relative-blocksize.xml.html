    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the mailing list, Jakob Rönnbäck suggested adjusting the difficulty of individual blocks based on their relative size to the average block size of the previous period. This would allow for block size to increase as usage grows, but confirmation times would also increase. Anthony Towns responded by suggesting that dynamically adjusting the max blocksize would be simpler than implementing Rönnbäck's suggestion. He added that if the increase in confirmation time due to miners finding harder blocks is reflected back as decreased difficulty, this adjustment would make more sense.</p>
