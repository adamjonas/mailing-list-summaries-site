    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the fee market. The paper being discussed provides a detailed analysis of mining advantages in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. It shows how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates, leading to a marginal profit structure which decreases as a function of hashrate. The paper also addresses the critiques made by the community to Peter R's work. Large miners already have their own network to relay blocks around the globe with only a few bytes on the wire at block-time. Transaction validation time can be rather easily made negligible. Thus, the optimal block size is essentially including everything that is in the mempool of other reasonably large miners. However, such a system provides strong incentives for the network to centralize in other ways (put all the mining nodes in one DC for all miners, etc). If all the mining nodes are in one data center and if all the nodes are programmed to build blocks in essentially the same way, then the orphan cost would be negligible.</p>
