    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, there was a discussion among developers about the maximum block size for Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen believed that the maximum block size should be increased because running out of capacity would be disastrous. Pieter Wuille, however, disagreed and believed that the demand for block size is infinite and that acting out of fear does not improve the system. He suggested reducing the maximum block size to 0.125MB, which would allow for 0.375 transactions per second and increase the number of full nodes from 5,000 to 50,000. Wuille also proposed other sizes to consider such as 0.5/0.7/0.9MB and asked for reasons why the block size should or shouldn't be reduced.</p>
