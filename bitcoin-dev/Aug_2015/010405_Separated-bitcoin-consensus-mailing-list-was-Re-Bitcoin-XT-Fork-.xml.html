    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and other Bitcoin developers, the topic of discussion was regarding the need for a dedicated forum where technical issues can be discussed without any noise. The concern was that non-technical people tend to chase technical discussions and cause confusion. The idea proposed is to have a moderated mailing list where only academic and technical matters are discussed, and offenders can be moderated out. The developers also suggested the need for a bitcoin-announce read-only list, where consumers of Bitcoin Core can subscribe to receive announcements about new versions of Bitcoin Core and any critical warnings. This would benefit miners and service providers. Jorge Timón suggested separating Bitcoin Core-specific development from general bips and consensus discussions. However, there is a potential downside to too much separation, which could become confusing. Instead, he suggested having a -dev and -discuss list to start with and see how it goes. The developers agreed that there is a need for a general discussion mailing list.</p>
