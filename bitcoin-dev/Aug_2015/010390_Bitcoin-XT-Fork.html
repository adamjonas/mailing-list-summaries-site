    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 15, 2015, Satoshi Nakamoto via bitcoin-dev expressed concern over the block size debate and shared his thoughts on Bitcoin XT. He stated that the developers of Bitcoin XT were violating the original vision of Bitcoin by forking the system in such a way that it could redefine what "Bitcoin" is without widespread technical consensus. He believed that Bitcoin was supposed to be both technically and socially robust. Furthermore, he acknowledged that a lot had changed since the design of Bitcoin, and new knowledge had been gained that contradicted some of his early opinions. The developers of Bitcoin XT made no pretense to work through the process involved with bitcoin development. Instead, they attacked Bitcoin in their latest presentation as a means to sidetrack real discussion necessary to resolving issues and achieving consensus in block size debates. They are operating outside of the development funnel, meaning the BIP process. Mike Hearn is the biggest cheerleader for this project, yet there are questions about why he supports it so strongly when nobody wants it. His disinterest in following what is actually happening with votes on legitimate proposals also calls into question his motives. XT is not even truly the implementation of BIP 101, which is found on GitHub. It is currently a closed issue. BIP 100 is anticipated to be submitted with implementation in the next two weeks, and many miners are already voting on it. According to xtnodes.com, XT runs minimal nodes compared to the rest of the nodes being run across the network. Satoshi Nakamoto believes that Bitcoin should have a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism. Odinn urges the community not to download the XT software and to cast it back into the fires from whence it came.</p>
