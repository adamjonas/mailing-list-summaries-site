    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo stated that several large miners pre-relay the blocks they are working on to their nodes globally, which reduces the relay time for transactions. After broadcasting to all of their nodes, hops to other mining nodes are probably only a handful of ms away with very low packet loss, so relay time is no longer connected to transaction inclusion at all. Thus, the orphan risk for including a transaction is related to the validation time, which is only DB modify-utxo-set time essentially. The increased orphan risk can be reduced to a tiny amount by including everything that is already in the mempool of reasonably large miners. Small miners, however, are at a disadvantage in such a system. Peter R responded by stating that as long as the block solution announcements contain information about the transactions included in a block, then the fee market will be healthy. He added that the fee market would not be healthy if the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks. Daniele Pinna submitted a paper to the dev-list analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. The main result of the work is a detailed analysis of mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate. It shows how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increasing of marginal profits as hashrates grow.</p>
