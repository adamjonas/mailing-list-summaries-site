    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dave Hudson stated that a block maker does not orphan its own blocks. However, Gavin Andresen disagreed with this statement and argued that unless the block maker has an infinitely fast connection to its hashpower or its hashpower is not parallelized at all, it will orphan its own blocks. This is because two hashing units may find solutions in the time it takes to communicate that solution to the block maker and to the rest of the hashing units. Gavin Andresen suggests that this issue could be further explored in another paper, as there are many factors to consider such as communication advantages versus cooling costs.</p>
