    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion between Thomas Zander and Jorge Timon about Bitcoin's block size. Timon asks Zander what other problems there are apart from fees that could arise if the block size isn't increased, to which Zander responds by saying he had put forward ten reasons in the last 24 hours but all Timon remembered was something with fees. Timon argues that Zander never wrote rising fees as being a problem directly, and that Zander dodges the question. Zander tries to avoid putting blame and polarizing the discussion, but Timon accuses him of spreading FUD. Zander responds by saying everyone knows that bigger blocks won't solve the scalability problem and that substantial growth can't be achieved in the next 12 months using lightning or higher fees. Timon disagrees with this and questions how future demand can be easier to predict than software development times.</p>
