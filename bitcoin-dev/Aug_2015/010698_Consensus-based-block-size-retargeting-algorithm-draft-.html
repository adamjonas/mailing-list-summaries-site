    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal being discussed in this bitcoin-dev thread involves addressing problems with previous proposals while avoiding a large step discontinuity in the block-size limit. The new proposal starts with a 1-MB limit and throttles changes to Â±10% every 2016 blocks, while also imposing a tangible cost on miners who vote to raise the block-size limit. However, there is concern about a collective action problem, where individual miners may not want to vote for an increase in block size if nobody else does. A question remains about the mechanism for activation of the new consensus rule. In the discussion, Gavin Andresen calculates the cost for a miner to include an extra 500-byte transaction, which he deems excessive. Matt Whitlock calls this proposal the best he's seen yet. Links are provided to the proposal on Github and the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
