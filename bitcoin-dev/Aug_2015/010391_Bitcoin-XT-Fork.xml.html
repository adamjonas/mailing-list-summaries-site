    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is currently embroiled in a debate over the block size. Some people are advocating for an increase in the block size limit to 8MB, while others believe that such an increase would be disastrous for the network. One group of developers has even created a fork called Bitcoin XT that would implement the larger blocks. However, some members of the community have criticized Bitcoin XT, saying that it violates the principles of Bitcoin development and that its developers are not following the proper process.One critic, odinn, wrote a scathing post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, saying that the XT developers "make not even a pretense to work through process involved with bitcoin development." Odinn also suggested that Mike Hearn, one of the main developers behind Bitcoin XT, may have ulterior motives for pushing the project so hard.Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin, also weighed in on the debate in a post to the mailing list. Nakamoto expressed his disappointment with the way the debate has been conducted and said that if two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then he will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.</p>
