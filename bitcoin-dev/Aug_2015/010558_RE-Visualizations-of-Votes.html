    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A simple tracking page has been created by an anonymous user that currently includes the 8MB vote and XT, as well as the /BV\d+/ vote for generic size. In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Nicolas Dorier suggested creating a pie chart visualisation of the percentage of votes for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, etc. based on what's published in blocks. However, formal votes do not exist and there is no standard way for miners to vote informally for a BIP they support. Responding to this, odinn asked if there is a way to visually have formal votes appear in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks. Odinn appreciates good visualisations and is trying to get a (visual) comparison of the votes on competing proposals.</p>
