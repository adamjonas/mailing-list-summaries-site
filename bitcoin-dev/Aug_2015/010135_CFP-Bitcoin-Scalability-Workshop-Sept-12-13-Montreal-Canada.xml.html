    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin development community is organizing a pair of workshops to aid the technical consensus building process with the aim of safely improving the scalability and decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network. The first workshop, taking place in Montreal in September 2015, will set evaluation criteria and analyze tradeoffs for proposals to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits. It will not host sessions on specific proposals, which will be discussed at a second workshop in Hong Kong in November or December. Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event. The workshops aim to facilitate the existing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) process. Travel and venue details, and accommodation recommendations are available at scalingbitcoin.org. There will be an application process for independent or academic researchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to give a presentation. The four underwriters of this event have agreed to jointly review applications and cover the travel subsidies for qualified presenters. Sponsors include: Cryptsy, BitcoinTalk, Final Hash, Blockstream, MIT DCI, Chaincode Labs, IDEO Futures, Kraken, and Chain.com. If anyone has research relevant to issues surrounding Bitcoin scalability, their proposal for a presentation at the Montreal workshop would be most welcome.</p>
