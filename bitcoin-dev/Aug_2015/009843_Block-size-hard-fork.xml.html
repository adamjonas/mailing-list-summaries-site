    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion surrounding the potential fork of the blockchain due to larger blocks has not addressed what will happen when it occurs, according to a post on a forum. The writer believes that the issue is not as significant as some suggest because transactions on the smaller chain can still appear on the larger chain, and there is nothing tying transactions to the blocks they appear in. However, miners are likely to move to the larger chain to seek higher profits due to increased fees. To prevent this from occurring, the serialized format of transactions on the smaller chain would need to be changed so that signatures are no longer valid across chains. It has been suggested that the losing chain would have its coins sold down, but selling off the smaller chainâ€™s coins in the short term is not advisable as these transactions will still appear on the larger chain.</p>
