    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on August 4th, 2015, Jorge Timon and Hector Chu discussed the arbitrary nature of Bitcoin's block size limit. Timon argued that there was no specific block size that was better than another, but proponents of increasing the limit needed to convince users who were concerned about mining centralization. He also claimed that hitting the limit at any block size would have similar harmful effects. Chu disagreed, stating that a one-time increase to 8MB was safer than a dynamically growing limit over time. However, he admitted that the next debate for increasing the block size above 8MB would be more difficult. The two also debated the significance of the economic majority in decision-making and the rationale behind block size increases.</p>
