    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a conversation between two individuals, Peter and BIP, regarding a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) titled "NODE_BLOOM service bit." The BIP extends the existing proposal, BIP 37, by defining a service bit that allows peers to advertise their support for bloom filters explicitly. It also updates the protocol version to enable identification of old nodes lacking the new service bit. BIP 37 did not specify the bloom filter service bit, which assumed that all nodes that serve peers data support it. However, the connection filtering algorithm proposed in BIP 37 has been shown to provide little privacy and poses a large Denial of Service (DoS) risk on some nodes. Therefore, the new service bit allows node operators to disable connection bloom filtering, making it a much-needed feature. The added protocol bit is NODE_BLOOM=(1<<3), which specifies the bit value and position. The authors of the BIP are Matt Corallo and Peter Todd, and it falls under the Standards Track (draft) type. The BIP was created on August 20th, 2015.</p>
