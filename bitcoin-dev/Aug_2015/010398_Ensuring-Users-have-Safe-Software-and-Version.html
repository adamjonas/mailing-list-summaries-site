    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin.org website currently states that there is no ongoing event on the Bitcoin network. However, a more recent alert published on the website suggests that the issues discussed relative to the 4th of July event still affect the network. To ensure safety, users are instructed to wait for 30 more confirmations than usual when using Electrum and directed to a resource on en.bitcoin.it. The most current version of Bitcoin Core is considered the safe software and version, as it ensures users are not connecting to an XT node inadvertently. However, the information about the software and version provided voluntarily by server administrators is not validated. There are different ways to determine which software is being used depending on what wallet people are using, such as Core or any other hardware, desktop, web, or mobile wallet. Depending on the wallet type used, the Get Block Header custom plugin can be used to authoritatively determine which side of the fork an Electrum server is on.</p>
