    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Friday August 7, 2015, Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev raised concerns about the possible consequences of the network reaching its capacity limit. He questioned whether there would be any other outcomes besides the minimum market fees rising above zero. Furthermore, he inquired about the number of clients that currently evict transactions from their mempool and how many wallets re-transmit their transactions when the local full nodes mempool no longer has them. He argued that if the backlog grows infinitely, it could pose a problem.Thomas Zander, in response to Timón's concerns, expressed his fear that pushing for off-chain transactions without producing a properly working alternative could lead to a backlash. He added that saying no to new customers would kill the product entirely, or at best, create an altcoin that quickly becomes the de-facto standard. Zander believes that, at this time and size of the bitcoin community, rejecting new users is not a viable option.</p>
