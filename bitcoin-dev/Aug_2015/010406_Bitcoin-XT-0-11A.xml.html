    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post on bitcoin-dev, Cameron Garnham discussed his views on Bitcoin XT's uphill battle. He stated that atomic inter-fork coin trades could diminish Bitcoin XT's chances of success, especially if Satoshi decides to sell 10,000 XTBTC for BTC every day for the first 100 days after the fork. Garnham also suggested some game theory tactics, such as spoiling the ballot and setting up atomic swap markets, which could hinder Bitcoin XT's economic investment. He further noted that some XTBTC advocates may sell all their BTC for XTBTC and vice versa, but most currency speculators will likely sell their BTC and XTBTC for fiat. This could cause both currencies to plummet in value. Garnham concluded that Bitcoin XT is in an extremely weak position from a game theory perspective. Eric Lombrozo responded to this post, suggesting that one way to permanently separate BTC from XTBTC would be to move them all in transactions bigger than 1MB. However, this may hurt the utxo size in Bitcoin XT. Finally, Garnham argued that Hearn and Andresen may have serious misunderstandings on how the global consensus works, which could ultimately destroy Bitcoin.</p>
