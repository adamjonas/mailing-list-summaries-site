        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The DECOR protocol is a proposed solution for miners to share block rewards when mining competing blocks. Ethereum also has a similar strategy, but it created an uncapped inflationary one that did not maintain the supply function cap. To address the problem of unbalanced rewards, the author then introduced DECOR+. However, these proposals do not solve the underlying problem if miners are dishonest.Therefore, the author introduces DECOR++, which pays full rewards to all competing blocks and selects the parent block based on deterministic random selection in the event of conflict. All transactions of competing blocks will be processed, and fees will be paid to original miners for non-conflicting transactions in uncle blocks. The money supply will be decreased in blocks following blocks including uncles to compensate for the increase in money supply, and the amount of uncles that can be included over an interval of blocks will be limited. Overall, DECOR++ provides a more comprehensive solution for incentivizing honest behavior among miners while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain system.</p>
