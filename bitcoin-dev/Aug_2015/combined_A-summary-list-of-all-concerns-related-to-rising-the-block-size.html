        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The importance of setting goals and developing roadmaps to achieve those goals is discussed in an article provided in response to a question about "develop-by-concerns." The article suggests that businesses should focus on identifying their concerns and developing plans to address them in a strategic manner, rather than constantly reacting to crises as they arise.In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Zander and Jorge Timon discussed concerns about increasing the Bitcoin block size limit. Zander argued that both Lightning Network (LN) and bigger blocks are needed to cope with Bitcoin's growing network and amount of transactions. However, he wanted to steer the discussion towards identifying risks associated with a block size increase so that they could be addressed before any change was made to the network. He urged contributors to think about potential risks, even if they were certain that these risks weren't a concern at the current scale, as identifying and estimating the risks would be useful for future increases.The debate over the maximum block size in Bitcoin has revealed a fundamental disagreement. While some believe that increasing the block size could lead to further centralization of mining, others argue that formal proofs show this is not the case. However, there are valid concerns related to increasing the block size, including the potential for mining centralization to worsen and for government control to enforce transaction censorship. This could lead to irreversible transactions being destroyed, making some use cases that rely on a decentralized chain impractical. In addition, reversible transactions will have proportional fees rather than flat ones, which could affect certain use cases like remittance. Overall, these concerns suggest that an increase in the block size could have negative consequences for the Bitcoin network.</p>
