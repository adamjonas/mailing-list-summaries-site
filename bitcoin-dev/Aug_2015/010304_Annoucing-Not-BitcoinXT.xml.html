    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The inability to make hard-forking changes to the protocol is a feature of Satoshi's protocol. There have been soft forks in the past which have caused problems, requiring cooperation between developers and mining pool operators to fix. However, we have never attempted anything as controversial as the block size issue being proposed. The risk of a hard fork mechanism that has never been attempted before could mean that each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite, leading to a war and tanking the value of everyone's assets on both chains. The author suggests testing out the system on a far less controversial change first. Many people have different priorities and preferences for these changes. Although the XT proposal is giving one idea special treatment above others, many have held back from pushing their own proposals out of belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important. It is suggested that nobody should be forced into doing anything and users should decide what Bitcoin is or isn't. The fear shown by the developers is considered to be telling.</p>
