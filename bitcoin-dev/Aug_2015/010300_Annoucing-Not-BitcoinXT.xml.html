    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Valiz responds to a post by NxtChg announcing Not-BitcoinXT, a version that can be used to protect the status quo until real technical consensus is formed about the block size. Valiz argues that there should be respect for what developers are doing and that people like NxtChg cannot force anyone to run code for their controversial hard fork. Developers should not be telling people what to do but rather trying to do what they consider best for the ecosystem given their technical abilities. NxtChg had referred to a bunch of self-proclaimed Bitcoin wizards who decided they have the right to tell everybody what to do and who never got to grow up and are now angry at the world for not listening to them anymore. Valiz criticized these dirty games of calling XT an alt-coin and censoring its posts, pretending to be Satoshi, sabotaging XT switch, etc. as being pathetic.</p>
