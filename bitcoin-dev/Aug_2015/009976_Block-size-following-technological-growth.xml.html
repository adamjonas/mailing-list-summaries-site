    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jorge Timón and Gavin Andresen, Timón revealed that he had learned more about Andresen's position on the subject in a single email than from months of discussion and blogs. One issue they discussed was the market minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction rising above zero. Timón believed that free transactions would eventually disappear, while Andresen believed that the limit would always be high enough so that free transactions are mined forever, and fees just allow users to prioritize urgent transactions. They also talked about whether block size increase proposals should have a criterion or test, but Andresen did not think all proposals needed to justify "why this size" or "why this rate of increase." The maximum block size rule serves to limit centralization by limiting how hard it is to run a full node, but Timón thinks it also limits how hard it is to be a competitive miner. They agreed to identify “fundamental assumption discrepancies” to avoid circular discussions.</p>
