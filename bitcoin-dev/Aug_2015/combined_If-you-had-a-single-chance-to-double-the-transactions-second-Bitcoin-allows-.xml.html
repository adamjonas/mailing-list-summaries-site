        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context discusses the options for a one-time hard fork in Bitcoin, either doubling the block size or reducing the block rate to half. Sergio Demian Lerner proposed both options in 2015, arguing that reducing the block interval would save real time and eliminate the long waiting period for a 3-block confirmation. However, doubling the block size is safer than halving the block interval as it comes with fewer costs to SPV proofs and mining centralization. Both changes require minimal code changes, but currently, there is no idle mining hardware for hire, so the security of six 10-minute block confirmations is equivalent to six 5-minute block confirmations.The discussion also mentions the importance of response time in completing transactions, and the need for multisignature notaries like Greenaddress.it or the Lightning Network for double-spend protection. The author of the message also researched the viewpoints on increasing the target block creation rate, which could reduce miner variance and aid miner decentralization.On August 7, 2015, Sergio Demian Lerner proposed reducing the block rate to half with an average of 5-minute blocks. While some argued that there were no technical problems with this hard fork, others disagreed, stating that propagation delay problems would be doubled by reducing the interblock time. Doubling the block size is safer than halving the block interval for the same effect in aggregate transactions per second. However, Lerner suggested that most people would choose the latter option because it saves real time. Lerner argued that mining centralization would not be significantly affected by reducing the block rate and that SPV mining has improved the ratio another 2x because headers can be pushed even faster and fit in a single network packet. With a better wire protocol, a 10 MB block could be propagated faster than the time it takes currently to propagate an empty block. Having a lower average block interval strengthens Bitcoin's value proposition, so miners would be delighted that their bitcoins are more worthy.In an email exchange, the author argues that in some rare occasions, seconds matter more than minutes, such as when paying for parking with other cars behind you. Although it may take him tens of minutes to shop, he does not mind waiting a few minutes for payment confirmation, as long as the payment system allows multiple pending payments and does not block the next person from paying. The author believes that time is mostly measured in minutes, as it takes minutes to complete various everyday tasks, and a payment taking one minute would be much better than a payment taking ten. To address this issue, the email suggests using a variant of multisignature notaries like Greenaddress.it or the Lightning Network, which provide assurance of doublespend protection from the time of publication of the transaction to the first block confirmation through a combination of economic incentives and legal liability.</p>
