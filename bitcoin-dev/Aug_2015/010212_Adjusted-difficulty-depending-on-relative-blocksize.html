    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about the possibility of adjusting the difficulty for individual blocks depending on the relative size to the average block size of the previous difficulty period. The idea is that calculating the average block size for the previous difficulty period and adjusting the difficulty by adding the relative size difference could force miners to make blocks as close to 1mb as possible. However, this method may only be useful on the upside of the blocks, meaning that blocks smaller than the average size would not get adjusted difficulty. The discussion also includes a numeric example to clarify the concept. In a possible future, when the block reward is insignificant compared to the transaction fees, miners could make bigger blocks as fees rise. The email includes links to GitHub and Twitter profiles of the people involved in the discussion.</p>
