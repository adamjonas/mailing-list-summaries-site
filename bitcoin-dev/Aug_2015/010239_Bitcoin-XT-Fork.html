    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, a message from someone claiming to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto was posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The message expressed concern about the development of Bitcoin XT, which was seen as a potential fork from the original vision of Bitcoin. The author claimed that Bitcoin was designed to make future modifications to consensus rules difficult without near-unanimous agreement, and that doing a fork in this way violated the "original vision" of Bitcoin. They also acknowledged that new knowledge had been gained since Bitcoin's creation, and that preserving its security properties while making it a competitive monetary system was not a trivial problem. The author warned that if two developers could successfully redefine what "Bitcoin" is through populist tactics, then they would have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project. The message concludes by saying that the present situation has been disappointing to watch unfold.</p>
