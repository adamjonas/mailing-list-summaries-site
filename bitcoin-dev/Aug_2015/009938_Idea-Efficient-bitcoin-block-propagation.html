    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests introducing bitcoin-backed guarantees between miners to increase the speed of block propagation on the network, even with slow internet connections or large block sizes. This would allow miners to mine on blocks that are not yet fully transmitted and reduce confirmation times while strengthening the distributed nature of bitcoin. The idea could be implemented as a fork of bitcoind or as a layer between the standard bitcoind and mining equipment. The proposal is currently at version 0.2 and can be found in both PDF and HTML formats. While there may be nuances to address, the authors invite friendly and constructive criticism and will answer all questions to the best of their ability.</p>
