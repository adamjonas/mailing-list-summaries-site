    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 20th, 2015, Tamas Blummer sent an email thanking Jorge Timón for his effort in separating the script engine into libconsensus. Blummer stated that Bits of Proof was now using its own or alternatively libconsensus for full validation. Timón replied with skepticism about creating a "full" consensus lib extracted from Satoshi's code. He did not think the result would be higher quality, measured on agreement with Satoshi, than other re-implementations. The rules outside the script engine are simpler and easier to capture exactly; however, they are scattered around and often repeated elsewhere. Completing libconsensus would solve this issue. Furthermore, since for consensus rules "the code is the specification," it is unfortunate that the specification is coupled with a concrete implementation (Bitcoin Core), and this issue should be fixed. The goal is not reimplementing the consensus rules but rather extracting them from Bitcoin Core so that nobody needs to re-implement them again.</p>
