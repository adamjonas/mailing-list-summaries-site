        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named odinn suggested the idea of creating pie charts to visually represent the percentage of votes for different Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). This suggestion was based on the data published in blocks. However, another user responded by stating that pie charts are not an ideal tool for visualizing data and shared a link to an article explaining why bar charts are a better option. According to the article, pie charts can be misleading and difficult to interpret, while stacked or grouped bar charts offer a clearer representation of the data.On August 21, 2015, odinn posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, seeking visualizations of votes related to various BIPs. Specifically, they requested pie graphs that would show the percentage of miners voting for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, and BIP sipa, based on the information published in blocks. Although odinn included a link to a website that provided insights into how developers felt about different BIPs, they were specifically interested in real-time visualizations that depict miner voting. The post was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. No additional details were provided in the initial post.The author of the post, odinn, is seeking visualizations of votes for BIPs. They are particularly interested in pie graphs that illustrate the percentage of votes for different BIPs by miners. While they shared a link to a visualization website they liked, they noted that it only covered the opinions of developers regarding various BIPs. The author desires a visualization that accurately represents miner voting and is updated in real-time. Additionally, they included links to their own website and a protocol concept.</p>
