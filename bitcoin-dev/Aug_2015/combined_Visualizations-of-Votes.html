        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user suggested creating pie charts to visualize what percentage of votes are being cast for different Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) based on data published in blocks, in an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. However, another user responded that pie charts are a poor tool for visualizing data and shared a link to an article explaining why bar charts are a better option. The article argues that pie charts can be misleading and difficult to interpret, while stacked or grouped bar charts can provide a clearer picture of the data.Odinn via bitcoin-dev posted a message on August 21, 2015, asking if anyone had visualizations of votes regarding various BIPs. They specifically requested pie graphs showing what percentage of miners were voting for BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, and BIP sipa based on what was published in blocks. They wanted to see a visualization that described miner voting visually in real time and included links to their website and protocol concept. The post was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation, with no further information provided in the post.The author of a post is looking for visualizations of votes, specifically ones that include pie graphs of what percent are voting for various BIPs. They provided a link to a visualization website they liked but noted that it only covered how developers feel about various BIPs. The author is interested in a visualization that describes miner voting visually and in real-time.</p>
