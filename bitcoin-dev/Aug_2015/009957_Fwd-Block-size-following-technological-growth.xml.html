    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen, Wuille asked if Andresen would be okay with the blockchain becoming inaccessible for low fee transactions and unreliable for medium fee transactions due to sudden influxes of high fee-paying users. Andresen responded that he was fine with this, as marginal transactions would be priced out if the network could not handle the transaction volume people want to pay for. When Wuille asked why an 8 MB block size was acceptable but a 1 MB block size was not, Andresen stated that "better is better" but he was willing to deploy imperfect solutions if they addressed short-term problems. Wuille proposed increasing the block size to address the issue of being "forever locked at the same scale" while technology evolves, but Andresen disagreed, stating that consensus was against Wuille on that point.</p>
