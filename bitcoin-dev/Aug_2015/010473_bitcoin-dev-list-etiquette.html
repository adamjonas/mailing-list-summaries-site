    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the intersection of politics and technology in the context of Bitcoin's development. The conversation touches on the idea that developers cannot avoid politics and must be aware of its impact on their work. However, some express frustration with the amount of political discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which they feel detracts from technical discussions related to Bitcoin development. One member cites a quote by Plato about the dangers of disengaging from politics, while another highlights the need for consensus in the space. The email also mentions a New York Times opinion piece about Bitcoin's potential danger to society, which the sender suggests had an impact on their ability to continue working on the code. Finally, there are links to a Facebook group and an article about Bitcoin and politics in New York State.</p>
