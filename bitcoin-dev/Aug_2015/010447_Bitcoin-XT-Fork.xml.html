    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on August 19th, 2015, Simon Liu asked a question toÂ a Bitcoin developer about the legitimacy of a claim made by Olivier Janssens that a colleague was requesting Gavin Andresen be removed from his position as Chief Scientist of the inactive Bitcoin Foundation. The developer responded that such a request would be reasonable, arguing that the title of "Chief Scientist" misleads the public into thinking that there is centralized decision-making in Bitcoin when there isn't. This could harm the reputation of Bitcoin and confuse the public into thinking that it's not different from conventional financial systems. The email also stated that regardless of personal views on Bitcoin XT, this situation was bad for Bitcoin.</p>
