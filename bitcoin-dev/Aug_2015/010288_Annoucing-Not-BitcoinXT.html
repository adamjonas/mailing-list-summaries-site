    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new version of Bitcoin, called Not-BitcoinXT, has been announced on GitHub, which can be used to maintain the current state of the blocksize until a "real technical consensus" is reached. However, some individuals referred to as "self-proclaimed Bitcoin wizards" are attempting to control what others do with the cryptocurrency. These individuals believe that Bitcoin is decentralized but insist that users follow their guidelines. The situation has resulted in name-calling, censorship, and sabotage of the XT switch. Despite these tactics, the history will roll over those who try to control Bitcoin, and the harder they try, the quicker it will happen.</p>
