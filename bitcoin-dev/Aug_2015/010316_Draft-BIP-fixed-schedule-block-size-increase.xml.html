    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on June 26, 2015, Tier Nolan suggested that miners vote to decide the soft limit for block size. However, one member of the conversation argued against this idea, stating that it would not be interesting to make miners vote on the lower limit and that if the community wanted to reduce the size to limit mining centralization, it's possible that the hashrate majority may oppose the change. This could lead to an anti-miner hardfork instead of a softfork. It was also argued that giving something to miners may result in them not wanting to give it back later. The group discussed potential scenarios, such as reducing the supply to 15 M through a softfork, which would be controversial among miners. The discussion referenced BIP99.</p>
