        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The current block size debate in the Bitcoin community has highlighted the issue of decreasing full nodes, leading to a "tragedy of the commons" problem. Full nodes bear the cost of validating, relaying, and storing the blockchain without receiving any financial gain. However, these nodes play a crucial role in validating transactions and preventing miner dishonesty. As more people use Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, the burden on existing full nodes increases, further reducing their numbers.The technical community opposes significant block size increases as it exacerbates the problem of decentralization. While existing hardware is capable of handling larger blocks, the core issue lies in incentivizing individuals to run full nodes. Previously, there was no trustless way to compensate full nodes for their services, especially for small micropayments. However, the concept of lightning and payment channels may provide a solution.In this proposed system, full nodes could advertise their rates to SPV nodes upon connection. The SPV nodes would then have the option to agree to the fees or seek out another node with lower charges. If implemented, competition would drive down fees to levels close to the cost of running a full node, encouraging more individuals to operate full nodes and improving decentralization in the network.Luv Khemani, in a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussed the issue of full nodes and their significance in transaction validation and maintaining the integrity of the protocol. The tragedy of the commons problem arises because full nodes bear the expenses of blockchain operations while gaining no financial benefit. As a result, the percentage of full nodes in the Bitcoin network continues to decline, particularly as more users adopt SPVs. This issue is further compounded by the fact that increasing the block size would burden existing full nodes even without an increase in demand. The core concern for the technical community is the decentralization of the network, which would be worsened by drastic block size increases.Although the hardware and bandwidth required to support larger blocks are within reach for many individuals globally, the main challenge lies in creating incentives for running full nodes. Khemani suggests that payment channels and lightning could address this issue. By allowing full nodes to advertise their rates to SPVs, competition would drive fees down to a level similar to the cost of running a full node. Consequently, this would encourage more people to operate full nodes, leading to increased decentralization in the network.</p>
