    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange dated August 3, 2015, Simon Liu opined that increasing block size would not be a problem for Chinese miners. He listed F2Pool, Antpool, BW, BTCChina, and Huobi as the largest Chinese miners who signed a draft agreement indicating their acceptance of an increase to 8 MB. However, this approach was criticized as not being scientific and could lead to disastrous consequences. The priority should be on ensuring the security of the system rather than engaging in political lobbying. Secondly, it was suggested that the Chinese miners agreed to the increase under duress of threats of worse outcomes beyond what they felt they could safely cope with. On the other hand, there's good news regarding China's international bandwidth as intra-Asia capacity is improving all the time, and a major consortium cable, FASTER, is expected to come online in Q2 2016.</p>
