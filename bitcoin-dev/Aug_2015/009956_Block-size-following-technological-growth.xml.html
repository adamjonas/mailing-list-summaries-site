    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille, they discussed the issue of block size in Bitcoin. Wuille argued that increasing the block size limit would lead to competition for block space, making the blockchain inaccessible for low fee transactions and unreliable for medium fee transactions. He proposed a solution that addresses the need to improve scalability without artificially limiting or centrally controlling the supply of block space. However, Andresen disagreed with this proposal and believed that competition for block space is good and that artificially limiting or centrally controlling the supply of block space is what is bad. Ultimately, the decision on the block size limit is made by consensus as a community.</p>
