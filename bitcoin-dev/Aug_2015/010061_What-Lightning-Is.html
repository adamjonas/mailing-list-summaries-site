    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from August 9, 2015, Mark Friedenbach argued that funds were advanced by the hub on the creation of a channel and there is no credit involved. However, Friedenbach acknowledges that the hub does not have to advance anything and if it does, Bob can expect to pay for it. He predicts that hubs will assess a fee for depositing funds, which could depend on the amount deposited and how long it stays there. Friedenbach even suggests there is a name for these types of fees, but does not reveal what it is.</p>
