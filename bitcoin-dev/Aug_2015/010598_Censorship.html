    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of an email addressed to the bitcoin-dev mailing list commented on the strict moderation policies enforced on /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org. These websites are centralized forums that have rules to facilitate relevant and interesting discussions, block spam, and ensure discussions happen in their appropriate places. The author believes that these policies have helped to create a large userbase frequented by many relevant experts. Although some people consider these rules as censorship, it is not considered so because there is no government authority threatening punishment for discussion of a certain topic. People's rights to visit forums or websites where off-topic or against-the-rules discussion is happening are not revoked. Many people are unsatisfied with the moderation occurring on these websites. However, the switching cost for online discussion forums is very low. The author invites people to post links to bitcoin discussion forums where the moderation authority is different. One such example is /r/bitcoin_uncensored, which has become recently popular.</p>
