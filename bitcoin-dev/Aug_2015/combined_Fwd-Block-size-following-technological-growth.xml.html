        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In email conversations on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille discuss the possibility of 8 MB blocks and its impact on transaction fees. Wuille believes that an influx of users wanting to pay high fees could price out low fee transactions and make the network unreliable. In contrast, Andresen argues that if the network cannot handle the transaction volume, marginal transactions will be priced out. Wuille suggests that miners form SPV mining agreements to benefit from making their blocks slow to validate for others. He also believes that there is no short-term problem and finding a non-controversial solution is essential.Thomas Zander expresses concern about Bitcoin's security and the need for people to use full nodes to keep it secure in another email thread. Wuille agrees that running a full node and using it to verify transactions is how one gets personal assurance that everyone on the network is following the rules. He believes that the block size is the primary way to reduce the responsibility on the community to make it easy to run a node.The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list centers around incentives for running a full node. Pieter Wuille believes that if the incentives for running a node do not outweigh the cost/difficulty of using a full node, there is a problem. He argues that as Bitcoin's fundamental improvement over other systems is the lack of need for trust, increased adoption should result in an increased incentive for people to use a full node. However, he is seeing the opposite trend and is worried about it.Gavin Andresen disagrees with Wuille, stating that people in the Bitcoin ecosystem will choose different tradeoffs, and that block size has very little to do with the decision to run a full node or not. Thomas Zander points out that low node count does not necessarily indicate that it is hard to run one, but rather that running a node is only needed if you don't know anyone you can trust to run it for you. Overall, while the full node count provides feedback on how hard it is to run/use a full node, it is not the goal but merely an indicator. The blockchain itself cannot offer many tradeoffs, so the place to introduce them is in layers on top without hurting others.</p>
