    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list where some of the participants claimed that Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn had ignored warnings regarding the proposed changes to the block size limit. The discussion began with Adam Back stating that many people warned against the proposed trigger threshold of 75% and that in a hard fork, miner votes do not have the same significance as in soft forks. Btc Drak added that he had warned Gavin about this, suggested a timeout, and requested that hard fork deployment be cancelled if activation/enforcement did not occur within that timeframe. However, Gavin removed these suggestions from his pull request, ignoring the importance of such discussions in the pull request review process. Peter Todd criticized Gavin's behavior, calling it an abuse of the pull request process, and suggested that this should be taken into consideration when granting Gavin commit privileges for the Bitcoin Core repository.</p>
