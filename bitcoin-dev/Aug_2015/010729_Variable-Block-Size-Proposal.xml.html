    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Aug 29, 2015, a discussion was held on bitcoin-dev regarding the introduction of a mandatory minimum block size. Jameson Lopp expressed his opinion that it is wasteful to pad blocks with transactions that miners are sending back to themselves and recommended solving the block propagation issue by working on O(1) block propagation, which he admits can never be achieved without centralized topology. He also expressed concerns about the incorrect spread of the "O(1) block propagation" meme and discussed possible solutions like ansibles and safe zk-SNARKS for constant time block validation. However, he pointed out that these solutions are science fiction at the moment as they need to verify the snark proof for every node receiving and relaying the block. He agreed that a minimum block size would be inappropriate and ineffective in achieving its stated goals.</p>
