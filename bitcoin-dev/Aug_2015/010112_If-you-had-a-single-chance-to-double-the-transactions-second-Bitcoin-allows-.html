    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin-dev, member Sergio Demian Lerner suggested reducing the block rate to half, with an average of 5-minute blocks. Lerner argued that there were no technical problems with this hard fork, and that mining centralization would not be significantly affected. However, another member, Pieter, disagreed, stating that propagation delay problems would be doubled by reducing the interblock time, which has a stronger effect on centralization than block size. Pieter also criticized SPV mining as requiring trust between miners and breaking the security assumption of SPV clients. He suggested that the centralization pressure caused by reducing the interblock time was exactly what the community was trying to avoid.</p>
