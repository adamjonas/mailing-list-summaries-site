    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Chris Wardell questions the purpose of a maximum block size other than anti-spam measures and to force people into paying higher fees. The response to this is that the maximum block size consensus rule is in place to limit mining centralization, which is currently pretty bad. Gavin Andresen, who has written extensively on the subject, doesn't seem to understand this either and believes it only limits full node centralization. However, this is not the case, as the block size consensus rule limits how expensive it can be to run a full node. It appears that the effects of the consensus rule they want to change are not fully understood. An old but clear video explaining the reasons for the consensus rule is linked in the email thread.</p>
