    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate around the "max block size" for Bitcoin has led to a discussion about the possibility of implementing a minimum block size. However, this is a complicated issue for which there isn't an easy answer. The problem with using "block size" as a measure of resource usage is that it doesn't reliably measure typical usage transactions versus those constructed for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, designing for DoS worst case scenarios rather than the average/expected use case is necessary. There is also an issue of time horizons and what presumed improvements are made to the client. Bitcoin Core currently struggles to handle 1MB blocks but this is an engineering limitation. As a result, it's unclear whether to raise the block size before testing and validating any performance improvements. Most developers have not given straightforward statements on specific block sizes due to the complexity of the issue. Nevertheless, workshops are being organized to discuss these issues. The first workshop will be held on September 12-13th and the follow-on workshop will be in the Nov/Dec timeframe, where specific proposals will be discussed.
