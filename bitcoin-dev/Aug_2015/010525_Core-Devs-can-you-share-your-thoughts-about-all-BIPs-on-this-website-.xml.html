    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the email suggests that a separate column should be added to the website, stating "Technical Opinion," as it is not clear that by clicking on a name, you can access their opinion. They also recommend adding more core developers like Adam Back, Mark Friedenback, Jorge Timons, Peter Todd, and thebluematt, along with experts like Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlie Lee, and pools. The writer mentions that Mike Hearn is missing from the website. Nicolas Dorier created a website that displays charts of user's approvals for various BIPs. Users can fill out whether they approve or not and leave comments. HTML is accepted, allowing users to link their posts. The writer believes that this website would be beneficial to the community and asks for other important developers, big miners, and proposals to be added. Links to the website, the BTC Talk topic, and Github are provided.</p>
