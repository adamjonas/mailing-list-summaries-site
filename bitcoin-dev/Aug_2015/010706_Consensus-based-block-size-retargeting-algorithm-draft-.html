    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on August 29, 2015, Mark Friedenbach expressed his opinion against miners deciding on the consensus rule to limit mining centralization. He referred to the idea of miners voting on the block size or "softforking the size down if we went too far". Friedenbach believed that this is a terrible idea as it would allow miners to have too much control over the network, which could lead to centralization. He compared this with allowing pharma companies to write regulations on drug safety or car manufacturers to decide on indirect taxes for fuel.Friedenbach explained that miners should not be allowed to make decisions that could lead to centralization. He also added that even if a softfork was implemented, it wouldn't be useful if the hashing majority was fine with the current level of centralization. In such a case, a softfork would be an "anti-miner fork. "Overall, Friedenbach disliked both BIP100 and the proposal of miner's voting on the rule to limit mining centralization.</p>
