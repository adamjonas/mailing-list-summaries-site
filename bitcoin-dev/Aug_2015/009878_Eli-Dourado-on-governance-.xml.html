    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eli Dourado wrote an excellent blog post on how Bitcoin should be governed which hasn't been referenced yet. The author of the context agrees with Dourado's conclusions that there needs to be better communication and organization mechanisms between stakeholders, including developers, miners, merchants, exchanges, and end-users. The author also believes that the preliminary results of using a prediction market to tackle tough tradeoffs look roughly correct, except for the "Number of nodes" prediction. The author disagrees with this prediction, stating that they don't think replace-by-fee would affect the number of nodes, and even without any changes, the number of full nodes on the network will drop to a couple of thousand due to the decline of general-purpose-home-PCs. Business Insider reported on this trend in 2015.</p>
