    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email chain, Yifu Guo suggested that instead of a voting mechanism, it would be better to create an information site about the current outstanding BIPs and summarize their differences. He also recommended including supporting and counter statements regarding these BIPs on the site. The discussion then shifted to the topic of Chinese pools' opinions on increasing the block size limit. AntPool tweeted its support for big blocks and willingness to upgrade to XT, which surprised some people. While pools have agreed to increase the maximum block size to 8MB, upgrading to XT puts them on a schedule towards 8GB, which they did not agree to. Drak asked if there were any insights into what Chinese pools would accept as a compromise in terms of raising the block size limit.</p>
