        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread on bitcoin-dev, Andrew LeCody criticized a proposed scenario for Bitcoin XT to gain support by spoiling the ballot and having Bitcoin Core propagate the XT version string while encouraging miners to false vote for the fork. Matt Corallo responded that Bitcoin Core doesn't have to do this and it would be rational if more than 25% of hash power supported it. He suggested that if a 75% hardfork target was reached and over 25% of hashpower didn't allow the hardfork, then the miners who voted for the fork would be constantly generating blocks which are soft-forked-out by the >25% and non-supporting miners. Meanwhile, Mike Hearn expressed confusion about what most people think regarding key questions on block size limits, rate of hard limit growth, mechanism used to update such limits, transaction fees, and decentralization. He suggested a vote among core and XT developers on these questions and offered his own answers.</p>
