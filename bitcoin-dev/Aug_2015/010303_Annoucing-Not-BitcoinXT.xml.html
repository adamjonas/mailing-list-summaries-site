    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context revolves around the ongoing debate between the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT supporters. The author believes that constructive actions should be taken rather than wasting time in anger and disrespect towards each other. While the author acknowledges the constructive work done by the XT side, they believe it is the Core side that resorts to dirty tactics and sabotages community's free choice. They advocate for users to decide what Bitcoin is or isn't and nobody should be forced into anything. However, the author accuses the developers and their supporters of trying to stay in power, imposing their will on the ecosystem, and stifling any alternative opinions. Finally, the author points out the fear displayed by the developers, which is indicative of their real intentions.</p>
