    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer, has released a new patch set called Bitcoin XT 0.11A that includes bigger blocks. In his blog post, he explains that the only way to fix things with the Bitcoin Core project is through a fork, which is a natural thing in open source communities. He believes that Bitcoin Core has drifted too far from the principles that he and many others feel are important, and that a fork is necessary to bring the project back on track. Hearn's company, Blockstream, stands to profit from artificially limiting the blocksize, which creates a conflict of interest. As a result, he believes that it would be ethical for those who work at Blockstream to either resign or withdraw themselves from the blocksize debate. Hearn argues that hard forks are the only way to keep core developers in check and that network consensus matters more than core developer consensus. Miners should give Bitcoin XT a serious look, as they are in direct competition with the lightning network and sidechains for fees. The longer the blocksize debate drags on, the more Hearn agrees with BIP 100 and Jeff Garzik because outside forces are already influencing core developers, and they should not have complete control of the blocksize. Most mining hashpower is already voting for 8MB blocks BIP100 style, according to Hearn.</p>
