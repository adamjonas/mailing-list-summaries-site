    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, a user named NxtChg expressed their concerns about the relevance of discussing Bitcoin split in a technical and academic mailing list. However, another user argued that the topic is currently the biggest issue with Bitcoin and there should be a platform for general discussion. The second user suggested Reddit or creating another list with top XT people. The first user reiterated that the list is solely for technical discussions related to Bitcoin and urged everyone to have respect for other members who joined the list for this purpose. They also mentioned that off-topic and non-technical posts make it difficult to follow any technical proposals. The need for a separate general discussion forum was acknowledged, but the current list is not the appropriate place for it.</p>
