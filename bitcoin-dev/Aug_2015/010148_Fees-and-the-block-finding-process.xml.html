    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on August 11, 2015, Michael Naber expressed that lightning/hub and spoke networks do not meet the requirements for users wishing to participate in global consensus because all participating nodes are not aware of all transactions. However, Bryan countered this by stating that one does not need consensus on the lightning network since bitcoin consensus is used anyways. The properties of the scripts in the transaction ensure remaining guarantees after commitment transactions are deep enough in the blockchain history that removing them is impractical. One does not necessarily need to see all transactions but must look at the given transactions and draw conclusions based on the details to see if their commitments are valid or if the setup was broken.</p>
