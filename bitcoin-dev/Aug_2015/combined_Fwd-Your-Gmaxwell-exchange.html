        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email conversation between Greg and Peter R has been made public by Peter R after Greg forwarded their private conversation without permission. The discussion is centered around a proof presented by Peter R that simplifies assumptions to understand the dynamics of the transaction fee market. However, Greg deems the proof as "problematic" and of little practical relevance under reasonable assumptions. Despite this, Peter R argues that the proof assumes reasonably that block solutions contain information about the transactions included in a block, thus making the fee market healthy according to the definitions given in his paper.Peter R also highlights that Greg is imagining an academic scenario where all block solutions contain no information about the transactions included in the blocks which would result in an unhealthy fee market. This would require miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks as per their volition, leading to centralization of the system. In conclusion, Peter R looks forward to reading a white paper from Greg that shows under what network configuration his results don't hold.</p>
