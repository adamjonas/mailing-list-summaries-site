    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the network. Large miners have their own network to pre-relay blocks, meaning that at announce-time, there are only a few bytes to broadcast, leading to very low relay times. Transaction validation upon receiving a block can be made negligible, reducing the increased orphan risk for including a transaction to a tiny amount. In such a system, small miners are completely screwed, but it provides strong incentives for the network to centralize in other ways. The email thread also discusses a paper submitted to the dev-list that analyzes how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. The main result of the work is a detailed analysis of mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate. As block subsidies decrease, the high-efficiency class is expected to vanish, leading to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate. The author apologizes for typos and looks forward to reigniting consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101).</p>
