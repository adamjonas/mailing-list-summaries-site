        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The BlueMatt relay network is a transmission protocol that aims to solve the issues of speed of transmission, block size, and block validation in Bitcoin. The network includes an optimized transmission protocol that sends the entire block using only a couple of packets, and no trust is required in this scheme. The efficiency of the current scheme could be increased greatly with small improvements or if miners created blocks in an aware manner. However, with a maximum block size turning into 5kb with the current setup, there hardly appears to be a reason to do so right now.In a discussion thread on Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding inquired about whether the relay network would validate block version numbers in the future. It was clarified that the relay network already validates block version numbers and only relays valid transactions. Sergio Demian Lerner asked if there was any up-to-date documentation about TheBlueMatt relay network, including what kind of block compression it was currently doing. In response, it was mentioned that Matt did not have an extensive write-up, but the basic optimization performed by the network was trivial. This optimization involves relaying transactions verified by a local node and keeping a FIFO (first-in-first-out) of the relayed transactions in both directions, which is synchronous on each side. When a block is received, it replaces transactions with their indexes in the FIFO and relays it along.The proposal suggests introducing bitcoin-backed guarantees between miners to increase the speed of block propagation on the network, even with slow internet connections or large block sizes. However, the proposal fails when it comes to showing if a block defined in the Guarantee Message has not been shown, making it unsuitable for a decentralized system like bitcoin. In an email exchange from August 2015, Arnoud Kouwenhoven of Pukaki Corp discusses feedback on Bitcoin block size optimization with an anonymous recipient who provides input about Bitcoin Core's cached validation.The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the technical aspects of large blocks and TheBlueMatt relay network. The relay network was discussed in detail, including its speed of transmission and block validation. It was noted that Bitcoin Core has cached validation for many years, which helps pre-validate transactions. Participants expressed confusion over the discussion about the impact of large blocks, miners building on invalid blocks, and the speed of block validation. Overall, the context highlights the importance of efficient block propagation and block validation in Bitcoin, as well as the need for effective communication and monitoring in the industry to prevent bad outcomes.The bitcoin-dev mailing list was used as a platform for various discussions related to Bitcoin development. One of the discussions was about TheBlueMatt relay network and its documentation, where Gregory Maxwell confirmed that SPV mining is a misnomer. He explained that Bitcoin Core has cached validation for many years which solves speed of transmission, technical block size issues and block validation. Another discussion was about the relay network in Bitcoin-dev, where Sergio Demian Lerner asked for up-to-date documentation and block compression method. Gregory Maxwell explained that the network does not perform compression as such, instead, it relays transactions verified by a local node and keeps a FIFO of the relayed transactions in both directions.Arnoud Kouwenhoven from Pukaki Corp proposed an idea to increase the speed of block propagation on the network after a new block has been mined. However, the proposal only works with a centralized trusted party, making it unsuitable for a decentralized system like bitcoin. The discussion also touched upon the bitcoin relay network, which is a backbone of connected high-speed servers, and the proposed solution to introduce bitcoin-backed guarantees between miners to reduce the effect of slow internet connections and level the playing field for all miners.The proposed solution to provide near-instantaneous block propagation on the Bitcoin network is to introduce bitcoin-backed guarantees between miners. This reduces the effect of slow internet connections, leveling the playing field between the 1st world fiberoptic datacenter miners and the rest of the world. The proposal is currently at v.0.2. The Bitcoin relay network is a backbone of connected high-speed servers to increase the rate at which transactions and new blocks propagate and remove several delays in processing. However, it would still require miners to download the complete block before building on top of it with any degree of confidence.Matt Corallo suggests checking Bitcoinrelaynetwork.org, which is already in use by the majority of large miners. The client could be tweaked easily to keep exactly its block ready to quickly relay to the nearest server. It may still marginally favor well-connected miners, but hopefully not much.</p>
