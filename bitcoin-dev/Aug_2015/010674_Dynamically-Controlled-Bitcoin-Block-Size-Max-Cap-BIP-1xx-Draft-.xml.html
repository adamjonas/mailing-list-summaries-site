    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests replacing the fixed maximum block size with a dynamically controlled maximum block size that may increase or decrease based on various network factors. There are two proposals presented in the document. Proposal 1 depends only on the previous block size calculation, while Proposal 2 depends on both the previous block size calculation and the previous Tx fee collected by miners. The rationale behind each solution is explained in detail. The document notes that this is a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol, and anyone running code that fully validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time or risk rejecting a chain containing larger-than-one-megabyte blocks. Other solutions considered are also mentioned. If consensus is achieved, deployment can be made at a future block number at which difficulty will change.</p>
