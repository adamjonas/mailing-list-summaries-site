    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context consists of some related commits from #6382, including a pull request (PR) closed for now, at least until #6235 is merged. The author wants to add the chainID field and support regtest in bip70 too. There are three different strings for testnet3: "testnet3" for the default data directory, "testnet" for the GUI style and strings showed to the user, and "test" for bip70. The author wants to simplify this by unifying everything to always use "testnet3", although that would require modifying bip70. Altchains aren't just altcoins and sidechains; there's also testchains like testnet3, regtest and sizetestN (#6382). Since there are so many possible instances for sizetest, testchains are already more numerous than altcoins. The author thinks we should make things easier to add new testchains, not harder. We could also use the genesis hash as the network name, but it's less clear and would involve lookups to figure out what the request is for if you find such a request in the wild. Alternatively, we can maintain the chain petname field, but those are just standard petnames, not unique and immutable ids like the genesis hash.</p>
