    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and others on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the implications of forking Bitcoin software. While some suggest that forks should be allowed by the nature of its license, others argue that extensive lobbying and PR campaigns could influence Bitcoin companies and miners to adopt a controversial fork. The conversation also highlights potential social problems, such as a government-controlled authority issuing an order and raising electricity costs for Bitcoin miners who adopt a specific fork. Despite the debate, it is agreed that Bitcoin's open-source nature and lack of central authority allow anyone to fork it, and there is no requirement for 100% of nodes in the network to run Core or other implementations. Bitcoin will not die or split because of a fork, but relies on the majority of miners not attacking the network for too long. Overall, users and economic power will ultimately win any dispute, and the benefits Bitcoin offers outweigh its limitations.</p>
