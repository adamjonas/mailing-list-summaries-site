    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 22, 2015, Ahmed Zsales shared an updated working draft in response to public and private comments and feedback regarding a long-term solution to replace mining rewards and transaction fees. The proposal is outlined in BIP 104, which is currently a discussion draft only. Specific clarifications on replacing the Coinbase subsidy and supplementing and not replacing transaction fees were highlighted in the update. The value of data mining was explained to be on a bell curve, so year six data will be removed every year. Additionally, the proposal involves creating global, national, and regional Bitcoin Price Indices for popular baskets of goods transacted with Bitcoin. It also references an ability to use structured block chain data for Bitcoin capacity and fork planning. Removed from the proposal were references to price speculation. Preferences for deployment dates of January 2017 or January 2018 were added. Lastly, the proposal will move towards BIP format after the discussion and evaluation period, at which point technical content will increase and discussion content will be removed. Feedback is welcome.</p>
