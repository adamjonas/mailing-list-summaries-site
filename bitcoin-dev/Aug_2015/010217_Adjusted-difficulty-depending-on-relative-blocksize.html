    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jakob Rönnbäck proposed adjusting the difficulty of individual blocks based on their relative size to the average block size of the previous difficulty period. This would allow for an increase in block size as usage grew but would also result in longer confirmation times. Anthony Towns argued that this would be a loss since confirmation times would increase, but Jakob countered that if it took 5% more time to find a block with 5% more transactions, it would essentially be the same. However, it was suggested that dynamically adjusting the maximum block size would be simpler. It was also noted that fluctuating difficulty could open up forms of attack on the system. Greg Maxwell and Mark Friedenbach's flexcap proposal, which relates to this idea, was discussed on the list back in May.</p>
