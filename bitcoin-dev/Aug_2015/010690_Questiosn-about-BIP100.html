    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The block size debate in the Bitcoin community has been ongoing for a long time. While there are different opinions about what value to use, Jeff Garzik, through a mailing list post on bitcoin-dev, suggests that the median is the most natural and logical option. He believes that using the median will eliminate the incentive to 51% attack, which would exist when any value other than the 50-percentile is used. Garzik thinks that if something other than the median is used, it should be symmetrical. If the 20th percentile is larger than the current limit, then the block size will increase, and if the 80th percentile is smaller than the current limit, the block size will decrease.In the same mailing list thread, Andrew C asked about BIP 100's deployment and whether there were any clients or code implementing BIP 100 at the time. To this, Garzik replied that he was working on technical BIP draft and implementation, hopefully for ScalingBitcoin.org, and that only the PDF was publicly available at the time.</p>
