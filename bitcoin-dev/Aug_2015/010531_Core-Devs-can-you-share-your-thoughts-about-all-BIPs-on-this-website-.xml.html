    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Nicolas Dorier, a contributor to the Bitcoin Core project, created a small website which displays a chart of approvals about various BIPs. The approval status can be filled by the user with a signed pgp message and comments can also be added. Dorier is open to adding other important developers, big miners, or other proposals that he may have missed. In an email thread discussing the website, members including Btc Drak suggested adding more core developers like Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Jorge Timons, Peter Todd, and thebluematt. They also recommended adding other experts such as Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, and Charlie Lee. Mike Hearn was also mentioned as a missing expert. The contributors were requested to send their PGP public key for verification.</p>
