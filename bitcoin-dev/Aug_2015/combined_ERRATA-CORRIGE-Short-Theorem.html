        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2015, Daniele Pinna posted a theorem on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that larger miners generate more revenue per unit hashing power. Pinna argued that there exists an optimal hashrate where the average revenue for each hash in service is maximized. Peter Todd agreed with Pinna's argument and shared his own math proof demonstrating that larger miners earn more money per unit hashing power. However, Pinna later clarified that his paper only showed the advantage of larger miners decreased with block reward, but it did not necessarily imply that the real revenue per unit hash advantage also decreases.Pinna suspected that the orphaning factor used, independently of the specific form of the block relay time, is incorrect or incomplete. The miner profit equations are merely lower bounds to the miner's true expected profit. The theorem implies that the marginal profit curve is a monotonically increasing function of miner hashrate, disproving any and all conclusions of Pinna's work and suggesting that centralization pressures will always be present. Orphan risks favor the larger hashrate miner leading to greater revenues per unit of hash.Mailing lists are a way for people or organizations to send group emails to a specific set of subscribers. There are two main types of mailing lists: announcement-only and discussion. Announcement-only lists are used for one-way communication, where the list owner sends out messages but subscribers cannot reply or participate in discussions. Discussion lists allow subscribers to participate in conversations and reply to messages sent by other subscribers.Mailing lists can be managed using specialized software or online platforms such as Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or Google Groups. These tools provide features such as subscriber management, message scheduling, and analytics to track engagement and performance. Creating and managing a mailing list requires careful planning and consideration. It is important to define the purpose of the list, identify the target audience, and create relevant content that aligns with their interests. Consistency and frequency of messaging are also key factors in maintaining engagement and retaining subscribers. Overall, mailing lists can be an effective way to reach and communicate with a targeted audience, but it requires effort and strategic thinking to ensure success.</p>
