    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread among developers discussing Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 100 (BIP 100), questions were asked about the "most common floor" and the deployment of the proposal. The BIP 100 suggests allowing miners to vote on the maximum block size they will accept, with the size increasing if 70% or more of the blocks mined in the previous two weeks have voted for a larger size. When asked about the "most common floor," Jeff Garzik, one of the developers, responded that it could be interpreted as the 20th percentile, but there is some argument for taking the mode of several tranches. Garzik also confirmed that the initial deployment would be in the same manner as size votes. Currently, he is working on a technical BIP draft and implementation, which will hopefully be presented at ScalingBitcoin.org.</p>
