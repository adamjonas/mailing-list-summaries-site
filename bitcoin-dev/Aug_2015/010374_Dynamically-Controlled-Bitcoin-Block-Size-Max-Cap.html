    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Danny Thorpe commented on a proposal for a dynamic block size limit that increases with demand. He liked the simplicity of the approach and questioned the need to ever reduce the maximum block size, suggesting that it could always be left at the "high water mark" even during periods of decreased transaction volume. Another member of the mailing list, Upal Chakraborty, argued against concerns that a miner with 11% of hash power could sabotage block size increases by only mining empty blocks, stating that doing so would not be economical and would result in lost transaction fees. Chakraborty proposed a modified technical solution to this potential problem, which involved adjusting the maximum block size based on the size of recent blocks, with input from both miners and end users.</p>
