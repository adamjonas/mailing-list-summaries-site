    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Danny Thorpe, a member of the Bitcoin development community, discussed the deployment of an uncontroversial hard fork in Bitcoin's main chain with another member. He suggested that it be deployed in testnet3 first. The other member expressed gratitude and asked how big-block testnet nodes would recognize each other on the peer network. Danny explained that even though they share the same port and magic numbers, each testchain has a different genesis block, so they will reject blocks from any other testchain from the start. However, he said that nodes can be manually connected to get the desired network topology for testing purposes. Finally, Danny stated that he did not have time to write tests and simulations himself but encouraged others to do it and offered to answer any further questions.</p>
