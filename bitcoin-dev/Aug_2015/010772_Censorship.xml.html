    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context suggests that there is a forum where people can share their thoughts and ideas without any censorship. However, the forum is under attack by an unknown attacker whose aim is to make the place unusable. Despite the attack, people are still posting on the forum since they are determined to keep the venue alive. It is unclear why the attacker is targeting the forum and what methods they are using to disrupt it. Nonetheless, the community remains resilient in the face of adversity, refusing to be silenced. The forum serves as a safe space for individuals to express themselves freely, and its importance cannot be understated. In conclusion, even though the forum is facing challenges, the community's spirit remains unbroken. The ability to express oneself without fear of censorship is a fundamental right, and it is heartening to see people stand up for it. The attacker may have intentions to silence the forum, but the users' determination to keep the place alive is a testament to the strength of the human spirit.</p>
