    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Rodney Morris expressed concern that the random distribution of transaction arrival and block times could lead to false signals. In response, another user suggested taking the average of all block sizes in the last 2016 window and increasing or decreasing the size limit accordingly. This would allow for larger blocks when they are happening slowly, but also creates state within the system. Additionally, miners could force the limit upwards by creating spam in full blocks. It was suggested that this approach be coupled with a hard limit that grows at a maximum reasonable rate. However, if the schedule is predictable, the maximum block size can be determined purely from the header and coinbase.</p>
