    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón in August 2015, Andresen argues that when networks become over-saturated, they become unreliable, which is bad. He adds that it becomes extra bad when the network is both unreliable and expensive. Andresen believes that increasing the maximum block size is necessary to avoid this situation. Timón responds by saying that he cannot see the difference between "unreliable" and "unreliable for cheap fee transactions." He says that transactions with the highest fees will always confirm reliably even if the network's capacity never increases and demand increases significantly.</p>
