    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has been monitoring the blockchain and noticed that even miners are struggling to download and validate smaller blocks. They believe that nodes are capable of handling blocks much larger than the current block size limit, but there is no incentive to run them. The data shows empty blocks being mined despite a non-trivial elapsed time from the previous block, and some miners are continuing to mine empty blocks via SPV mining even with preceding blocks as small as 50KB. This raises concerns about the global mining network's bandwidth and validating capacity. Unless miners are intentionally mining empty blocks, which does not make sense, this issue needs to be addressed.</p>
