    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, Peter Todd wrote a message on bitcoin-dev concerning Bitcoin XT's privacy problem with the automatic Tor exit node list download. He stated that it was not a bug, but rather a feature of the software. Todd further explained that these concerns were raised when Bitcoin Core rejected the submission in favor of a more generic approach that avoided being explicitly punitive towards the use of Tor and lacked privacy problems. Despite this issue, he noted that Bitcoin XT was still an improvement over the first implementation as it did not completely block the node once it filled up for the first time.</p>
