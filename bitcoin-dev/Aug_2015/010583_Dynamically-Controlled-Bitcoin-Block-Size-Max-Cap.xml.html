    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Peter Todd and an unknown recipient dated August 21, 2015, an analogy was made regarding the issue of Bitcoin's minority hash power partitioning. It was suggested that Pieter Wuille had shown that there was a fatigue problem with the brake cylinders and if used in stop-and-go traffic regularly, they would fail during heavy braking, potentially killing someone. The recipient countered with a study of highway driving which showed that if the car is only used on the highway, the brakes have no issues, claiming that the car design is perfectly safe.However, the author refuted this analogy by stating that the car crashes when the brakes are bad (minority hash power partitioned) and the radio is on (partitioned miners had small individual hashrate). They went on to check the scenario where only the radio is on and found that the car does not crash.Overall, the conversation centered around the issue of minority hash power partitioning in Bitcoin and the potential risks it poses.</p>
