    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This message discusses the creation of Not-BitcoinXT, an alternative to BitcoinXT. The author notes that only 25% of hashing power running Not-BitcoinXT is needed in order to interfere with miners running XT, since XT blocks are considered valid if they are on a valid Bitcoin chain. They also mention issues with the 75% upgrade threshold. However, there is not much detail provided beyond this.The message was sent by Julie via bitcoin-dev mailing list, and includes a link to the Not-BitcoinXT GitHub page. There is also a signature block at the end of the message, indicating that the message was signed with PGP and has not been tampered with. The signature includes a public key for verification purposes. Additionally, the message includes an advertisement for VFEmail's Metadata Mitigator service, which claims to keep users' emails out of the NSA's hands.</p>
