    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Odinn, has voiced support for a more gradual approach to the block size limit increase than that proposed by Jeff Garzik's BIP100. Odinn believes that a softforking solution with a grace period of between 60 days and a year would be preferable, given the number of valid softforking proposals available. In addition, some softforking proposals are not incompatible with BIP100. The discussion began when jl2012 proposed a block size increase to 1,414,213 bytes on January 12, 2016, gradually increasing to 8MB over 16 months. Pieter Wuille disagreed with the timescale, pointing out that recent softforks have taken longer to deploy. He also suggested that there is no indisputable evidence that we can currently deal with significantly larger blocks. Odinn responded by arguing that the block reward is miners' main income source and that mega-blocks would only be created if fees could cover the extra orphaning risk. He also pointed out that the original plan was for fewer full nodes as the network grew beyond a certain point. Finally, he suggested that a longer initial ramp-up period would allow for a slower long-term parameter and the restoration of the original 32MB limit within a reasonable timeframe of six to eight years.</p>
