    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Eric Lombrozo proposed a new attribute for BIPs indicating their "level", which would help prioritize and reduce contention over disagreements. The proposed levels are: consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. Lombrozo provided an example table of how this might look on his website. He also posted a new draft proposal on the website that needs further fleshing out. In addition, he suggested modifying the current "type" attribute to reflect different degrees of "standard" since just because many people do something doesn't necessarily mean it's officially endorsed by any other developers. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is open for comments and suggestions on these proposals.</p>
