    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 19, 2015, Santino Napolitano via bitcoin-dev wrote an email indicating that Gavin Andresen was on vacation and that there wasn't much for Mike to say in response to the Bitcoin Core developer pitchforks that were out for him. This was related to the highly adversarial and increasingly ridiculous charade of a mailing list that had been created. Despite this controversy, Gavin remained committed to his vacation plans. The email suggests that the XT fork would continue to have amazing leadership.</p>
