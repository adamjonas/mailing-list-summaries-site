    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 29, 2015, there was a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the issue of some altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC) and Feathercoin (FTC) having the same genesis block hash. It was mentioned that this is a design mistake in FTC, but not an unsolvable one. The proposed solution was for FTC to move their genesis block to the next block or the first one that is not identical to LTC's. However, it was noted that Bitcoin and all its test chains have different genesis blocks, so FTC may not be a concern for a BIP anyway.</p>
