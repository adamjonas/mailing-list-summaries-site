    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread involves a discussion on the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the fee market. The sender argues that the effect of block compression protocols is included in the "coding gain" represented by the Greek letter "gamma." As long as the block solution announcements contain information about the transactions included in a block, the fee market will be healthy according to the Shannon-Hartley theorem. The sender also notes that a scenario where the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks would result in an unhealthy fee market but requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition, essentially centralizing the system. In another email, Daniele Pinna submits a paper that analyzes how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. The paper provides a detailed analysis of mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate and shows how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates. It also shows that the large advantage the large miners have today is due to a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class, which is expected to vanish as block subsidies decrease. The paper reignites consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101), which has been hastily and undeservedly placed on the chopping block due to the XT fork drama.</p>
