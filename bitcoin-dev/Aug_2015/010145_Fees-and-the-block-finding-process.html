    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 11, 2015, Jorge Timón questioned the absence of response to whether there were any other reasons to increase the consensus block size besides avoiding minimum market fees from rising. Thomas Zander responded to Timón's email, stating that he had read Gavin Andresen's blog posts several times but still did not see what else could be feared from not increasing the size apart from fees maybe rising and making some problems rewardless of the size more visible. He urged for clear answers without fear, uncertainty, or doubt and hoped for a productive discussion.</p>
