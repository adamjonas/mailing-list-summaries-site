        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed various issues related to uncapped block sizes, with several papers submitted analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of such a system. One paper by Daniele Pinna looked at the effects of large block subsidies on mining advantages and found that they incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increase in marginal profits as hashrates grow. The paper also noted that part of the large advantage enjoyed by large miners is due to a barrier to entry into high-efficiency mining class.Another paper by Peter R focused on the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols and found that the results hold unless the information about the included transactions is identically zero. Matt Corallo added to the discussion, pointing out that many large miners already have their own network to relay blocks around the globe with only a few bytes on the wire at block-time. Corallo also noted that transaction validation time upon receiving a block can be easily made negligible, reducing the orphan risk for including a transaction to a very small amount.Pinna's work, which analyzed how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes, showed that large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates and lead to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate. He also noted that the high-efficiency mining class, which currently enjoys access to expected profits an order of magnitude larger than everyone else, is expected to vanish as block subsidies decrease. However, Pinna's work took up a lot of his time, causing him to lag behind on other work. Despite this, he stands by for any comments the community may have and looks forward to reigniting consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101).</p>
