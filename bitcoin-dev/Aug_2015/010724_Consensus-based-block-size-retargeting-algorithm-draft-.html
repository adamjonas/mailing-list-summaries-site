    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed idea involves a scheduled hardcap that increases over time, with miners voting on the blocksize limit within the hardcap to choose the new votecap. The mean blocksize over a set period is calculated for every block, and creating blocks larger than the mean but below the votecap raises the difficulty target for the miner. The degree of difficulty increase depends on where between the mean and votecap the size of the block is, and it can be either linear or logarithmic. The community would agree on a hardcap schedule in advance and have the option to threaten orphaning blocks via softfork if the votecap becomes too large. The softcap mechanism is used as a third check to orphan valid blocks if they are considered problematically large. There is no sensible non-miner mechanism for deciding max block size outside of using a community-coordinated softcap.</p>
