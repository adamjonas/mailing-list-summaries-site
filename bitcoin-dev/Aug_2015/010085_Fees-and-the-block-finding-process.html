    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on August 10, 2015, Jorge Timón expressed his belief that the only reason to increase the consensus block size was to prevent minimum market fees from rising above zero. He challenged anyone who believed there were other reasons for increasing the block size to provide their reasoning. Timón also noted that preventing fees from rising could harm the incentives to secure the chain by guaranteeing miners have no alternative income from fees as block subsidy dries up.</p>
