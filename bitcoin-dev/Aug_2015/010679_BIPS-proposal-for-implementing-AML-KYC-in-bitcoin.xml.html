    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2015, Oliver Petruzel expressed his disagreement with a statement made by Prabhat Kumar Singh about money being attached to life and not liberty. While he respected Singh's opinions, Petruzel believed that the dev mailing list was not the appropriate forum for philosophical discussions. He also stated that Singh had missed much of the point of Bitcoin, which he believed represented "monetary or economic liberty." Petruzel hoped that proposals like Singh's would never gain traction in the community and considered them to be the antithesis of the experiment. However, he offered to discuss the matter further over a beer and hookah, but didn't want to take up any more space or time on the topic in the email thread.</p>
