    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille in 2015, they discussed the need to raise the maximum block size of Bitcoin. Wuille questioned whether blocks should be increased out of fear of potential issues as the network approached its 1MB limit. Andresen believed that there were multiple reasons to raise the limit and that the opinions of smart engineers who had seen what happens when networks run out of capacity should be taken seriously. Wuille argued that demand is infinite without a fee minimum and that running out of capacity would occur at any size. He suggested that acting out of fear of this reality does not improve the system. Andresen agreed that the reason for an increase in the block size might be needed later, but it should only be considered if the benefits outweighed the costs. However, he cautioned against making technical decisions based on a fear of change of economics.</p>
