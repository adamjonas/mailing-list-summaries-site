    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jorge Timon and Gavin Andresen, they discussed whether miner B can maintain competitiveness against miner A, given that miner A can process 100 M tx/block while miner B can only process 10 M tx/block. Gavin Andresen pointed out that it depends on various variables that go into the mining profitability equation, such as access to cheaper electricity, more advanced mining hardware, ability to use excess heat generated from mining productively, access to inexpensive labor and capital to finance investment in hardware. The number of fee-paying transactions a miner can profitably include in their blocks will also eventually be part of that equation, and it is insignificant today. However, they want miners to include lots of transactions in their blocks.</p>
