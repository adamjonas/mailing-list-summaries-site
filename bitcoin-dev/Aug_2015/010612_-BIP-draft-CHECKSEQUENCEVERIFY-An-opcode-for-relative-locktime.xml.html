    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mark Friedenbach, a contributor to the development of Bitcoin, expressed his indifference towards the issue of bit inversion in a post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. He explained that he had implemented the feature in order to preserve existing semantics, even if they were not commonly used. This decision was driven by his desire to avoid the proposal being held up by those who argued that it was confusing because it changed how sequence numbers worked. Jorge Tim√≥n had previously raised an issue with this implementation on GitHub, and Drak had announced the pull request for the opcode CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY in Bitcoin Core.</p>
