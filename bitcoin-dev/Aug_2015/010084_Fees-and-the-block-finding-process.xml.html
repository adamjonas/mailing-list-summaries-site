    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context involves a discussion about the reasons for increasing the maximum block size of Bitcoin. The absence of response to some questions is interpreted as agreement among others that there is no other reason to increase the consensus block size besides avoiding minimum market fees from rising above zero. The author invites anyone to correct this notion by answering the questions and sharing their opinion. Gavin Andresen responds, stating that there are multiple reasons to raise the maximum block size, and that fear of running up against the 1MB limit causing bad things to happen is one of those reasons. Jorge Timón then asks what the other reasons are. Gavin takes the opinion of smart engineers who have seen what happens when networks run out of capacity seriously. Finally, the question is raised whether anything else will happen apart from minimum market fees rising when the network runs out of capacity, and it is acknowledged that any consequences of fees rising are included in this concern.</p>
