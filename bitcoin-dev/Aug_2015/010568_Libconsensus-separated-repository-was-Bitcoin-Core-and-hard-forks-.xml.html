    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Tamas Blummer discussed the risks and benefits of re-implementing and refactoring software. However, Jorge Timón expressed his goal to extract consensus rules from Bitcoin Core to prevent re-implementation. Tamas Blummer argues that compatibility with Bitcoin is important but wants to be able to create and serve other block chains with different rules. His company Bits of Proof uses Scala, Java, C++, and he plans to integrate secp256k1 (c) as soon as part of consensus. Since they already depend on libconsensus for VerifyScript, Tamas Blummer thinks it would be nice if it also offered VerifyTx, VerifyHeader and VerifyBlock. Finally, his plan is for the C API to interface with external storage by passing a function pointer to it.</p>
