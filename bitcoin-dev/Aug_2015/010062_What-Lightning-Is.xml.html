    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tom Harding raised concerns about the assumption that the Lightning Network (LN) will automatically be awesome simply because it is technically feasible. He noted that there has been a lot of emphasis placed on LN as the solution to the block size debate, but what if it turns out to be impractical in practice? In response to a comment by Mark Friedenbach, Harding pointed out that hubs could potentially charge fees for depositing funds into the network, and these fees could vary based on the amount deposited and the length of time it stays there. He predicted that hubs would likely assess "all of the above" types of fees, which he referred to as credit-like fees.</p>
