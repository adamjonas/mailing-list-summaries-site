    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin developers, including Wladimir, Greg, Peter Todd, Pieter, and Alex Morcos, have been discussing options for improving the signal noise ratio on the bitcoin-dev list. One solution suggested was to divide it into multiple mailing lists, but it was pointed out that the less technical Bitcoin discussion list already existed in the past and nobody used it. Instead, the discussion turned toward instituting on-topic guidelines for bitcoin-dev. Gavin, Wladimir, and a few others agreed to a simple few paragraphs written by Alex Morcos, which would be posted by Wladimir. The risk of having too many lists is interested stakeholders will miss discussions. We could reduce the off-topic/noise of bitcoin-dev considerably by offloading the non-technical/academic debate to the Bitcoin list. It just needs a bit of shepherding. One proposal is to respond when something is off-topic and offer a different place for the topic. However, no one has been implementing this yet because they don't have a strong handle on what is off-topic and what isn't. Thus, it is important to establish norms which requires some relative humility, courage, and honesty.</p>
