        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Miners are currently in the process of voting on BIP 100, which is expected to be implemented within the next two weeks. However, the exact details of the voting process for miners remain somewhat unclear. To gather more information, the author of an email sent via bitcoin-dev reaches out to the community, specifically referencing a post on Bitcoin Stack Exchange.The author's main query revolves around understanding how miners would cast their votes on BIP 100 if it were to become a viable option. While they have found some relevant information on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange post, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of when miners would actually take action and participate in the voting process.In addition to this primary question, the author poses a follow-up inquiry about the publication and acceptance of BIP 100 on GitHub. They express interest in knowing when exactly BIP 100 will be officially published and moved to the 'accepted' status on the popular code repository platform.Although the message from the author does not explicitly explain what BIP 100 entails, it is evident that their main focus lies in understanding the process of miner voting and the timeline for the publication of BIP 100. To provide further context, the author includes links to their website and Keybase profile, offering additional information about themselves.</p>
