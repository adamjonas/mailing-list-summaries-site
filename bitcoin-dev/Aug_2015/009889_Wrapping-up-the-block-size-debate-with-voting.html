    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2015 discussion on Bitcoin's consensus rules, Pieter Wuille argued that the system is not a democracy, but rather a consensus system. He suggested finding a solution that everyone agrees on or not doing anything at all. A proposal to wrap up discussion with voting by different stakeholder groups was presented, including miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators. The proposal outlined the requirements for each group to be eligible to vote, as well as the voting system, which used a single transferable vote and required voters to rank their preference. Technical issues such as double voting and multiple identities were also addressed. Links to relevant pages were included in the discussion.</p>
