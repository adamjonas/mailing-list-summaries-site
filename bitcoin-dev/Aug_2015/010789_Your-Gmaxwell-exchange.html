    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the importance of decentralization for Bitcoin, Allen Piscitello emphasizes that it is not an end-goal but rather a means to an end. The justification for the existence of bitcoin is rooted in its ability to function as a useful alternative without relying on the trust of third parties to process electronic payments. This requires decentralization and it is a requirement rather than a suggestion. Under a decentralized Bitcoin, systems can be as centralized as desired without affecting the parent, while under a centralized Bitcoin, there is no room to make it less centralized. Piscitello warns against hasty decision making for unclear goals and stresses the importance of properly bootstrapping a decentralized currency, as this may be the only shot we have to get it right.</p>
