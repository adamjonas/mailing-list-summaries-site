        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2013, a fork happened in the Bitcoin network, resulting in the release of a post mortem as a BIP. However, it isn't clear if an equivalent document was published for this year's fork. The nature and implications of this year's fork remain unknown.A blockchain fork happens when there is a disagreement between miners as to which version of the blockchain is valid. When this occurs, the blockchain splits into two, with one group sticking to the original protocol and the other group adopting new changes. The 2013 fork led to the creation of two versions of the Bitcoin blockchain, with one continuing under the old protocol and the other adopting new changes. This split had a significant impact on the value of Bitcoin at the time.However, there are no conclusive reports that describe the exact nature and consequences of the latest Bitcoin fork. It remains unclear whether any significant changes were made to the blockchain protocol, and what effect these changes might have on Bitcoin's future. Without a clear understanding of the fork's implications, investors and stakeholders are left in limbo, unable to make informed decisions about their investments. As such, it is crucial that a detailed post mortem be released for this year's fork, providing clarity and insight into the situation.</p>
