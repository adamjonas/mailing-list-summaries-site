    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Upal Chakraborty proposed a technical solution to the problem of miners sabotaging block size increases by only mining empty blocks. He argued that economically, it would not make sense for a miner with 11% hash power to sacrifice transaction fees by mining empty blocks as pool miners would switch pools and the pool owner would lose out. In his proposed algorithmic solution, if more than 50% of a block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is more than 90% MaxBlockSize, the MaxBlockSize would be doubled. If more than 90% of a block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is less than 50% MaxBlockSize, the MaxBlockSize would be halved. Otherwise, the MaxBlockSize would remain unchanged. This approach ensures that those who want to stop increase need to have more than 50% hash power, while those who want to stop decrease need to have more than 10% hash power but must mine more than 50% of MaxBlockSize in all blocks. End users will also have their say since they fill up the mempool from where miners take transactions to fill up the blocks.</p>
