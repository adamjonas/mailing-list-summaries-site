    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2015, Thomas Zander challenged Rune K. Svendsen's argument that Lightning Network (LN) would increase transaction fees for miners due to the value of transactions being raised on the blockchain. Svendsen had suggested that LN node operators could afford to attach larger fees to their settlement transactions on the blockchain, as they would have made more profit from the transactions routed through LN. Zander refuted this argument, stating that it made no sense for a company to give away profits without reason. He also questioned the assumption that users of LN would be willing to pay much higher fees for limited blockchain space, as compared to users of regular transactions. The email exchange revolved around the potential impact of LN on transaction fees and the broader bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
