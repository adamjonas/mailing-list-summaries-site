    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) has chosen Bitcoin-Qt client v0.11.0 for inclusion in its 2015 survey to measure wallet privacy. While volunteers will perform functional tests, several features are not easily discernible by non-developers, so the OBPP is asking developers for help. The project has drawn up a list of questions it would like answered about how different wallets handle transaction formatting, mixing, donations, balance queries and broadcasting, network privacy, physical access, custodianship, telemetry data and source code and building. Developers are asked to return their surveys before August 13 to ensure the score for their application is as accurate as possible.</p>
