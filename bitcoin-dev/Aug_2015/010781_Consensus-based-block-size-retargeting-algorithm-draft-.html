    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion, Jorge Timón and another individual are debating the issue of block size in Bitcoin. The other individual suggests that miners should be able to vote for a lower limit on block size, while Jorge Timón argues that a "hard cap" determined by miners does not protect against mining centralization as well as the current "hard cap" does. He suggests that as long as mining is largely dependent on energy, there is no hope to break the balance/imbalance. Jorge Timón believes that the community needs to agree on a criterion for changing the block size maximum rule that considers mining decentralization as the most important factor rather than the level of minimum fees. If the community can't agree on this, he predicts that there will eventually be a schism hardfork. He also suggests the idea of having a "decentralizedcoin," with very small blocks that everyone could mine with a CPU, which would be interesting if backed by famous developers in this area and was not just another scam coin.</p>
