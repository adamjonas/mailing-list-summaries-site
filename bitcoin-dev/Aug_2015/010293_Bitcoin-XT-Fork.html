    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 17, 2015, Oliver Egginger requested on the bitcoin-dev mailing list to delete Satoshi Nakamoto's old email addresses from the list and block them. This request was made after the news broke that Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. While it is unclear why Egginger wanted to block the email addresses, it can be assumed that it was due to the increased attention on Satoshi Nakamoto and his identity. The request was made to all members of the list, as Egginger could not find an owner for the list.</p>
