    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated August 28, 2015, Matt Whitlock raised a concern about a proposal lacking clarity on the mechanism for activation of a new consensus rule. The proposal suggested that when a certain percentage of blocks mined within a 2016-block retargeting period contains valid block-size votes, the new rule would be activated. However, the author chose not to address hard fork methodology at this stage and instead, focused on the main algorithm.There were several options available for deployment, including a simple fixed activation which was feasible due to the industry's willingness to rally around a single proposal. Although there were no strong preferences at that time, the author expressed their willingness to add a deployment section in the future once a clear way forward with the blocksize proposal was established.</p>
