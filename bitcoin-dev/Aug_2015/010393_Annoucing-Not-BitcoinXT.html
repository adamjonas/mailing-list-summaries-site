    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed block size increase for Bitcoin-XT has sparked controversy among developers. While some see a larger block size as necessary to accommodate increasing numbers of transactions, others warn that such a change could negatively impact the network and its users. The issue is particularly divisive because it requires a hard fork, which is much more difficult to implement than a soft fork. Developers are working on multiple proposals for improving the network, but there is concern that the debate over the block size increase will devolve into a "fork war" that could harm the network's stability. Some developers argue that the debate highlights the need for better governance in the Bitcoin community.</p>
