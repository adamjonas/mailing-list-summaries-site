    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Timón accused other members of dodging his question about potential problems that may arise with larger blocks. One of the respondents countered that they had already given a direct answer to the question, stating "To buy more time, get bigger blocks now" and providing links to previous emails discussing the issue. Timón then suggested classifying the potential problems, which included indirect consequences of rising fees and software issues independent of block size. The respondent argued that this was not narrow enough and included everything that may be needed in the future. Another respondent warned that if the 1MB limit on Bitcoin blocks is not increased, it could cause banks and businesses to lose confidence in the currency and result in a loss of value. Timón expressed frustration with feeling like he wasn't receiving straight answers and asked for clarification, rather than being accused of dodging the question.</p>
