    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2015, Mike Hearn and Jonas Schnelli discussed the needs of some users in regards to bitcoin wallets. Hearn praises Schnelli's analysis of user needs but suggests taking a slightly different path to meet those needs. He proposes supporting serving of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets from pruned storage, which would require protocol upgrades and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). This would help all SPV wallets, including those on mobile phones. Hearn also suggests creating a desktop wallet app based on bitcoinj that contains a bundled bitcoind. However, Hearn's proposal doesn't fully align with Schnelli's original post, which advocated for a single set of reference implementations for different components unless something not explicitly stated is supported. Without getting rid of bitcoin-qt in its current form, Hearn's proposal may not meet the spirit of Schnelli's recommendation.</p>
