    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email, Peter Todd wrote that there is a privacy problem with Bitcoin XT's automatic Tor exit node list download. While the code does not reveal any IP information in the common scenario of a firewalled node, where the operator has neglected to explicitly set -listen=0, it still downloads the Tor exit node list, revealing the true location of the node. Gregory Maxwell removed the last "call home" feature in pull-req #5161, replacing previous calls to getmyip.com-type services with a local peer request. Similarly, the DNS seeds use the DNS protocol specifically to avoid leaking IP address information. Mike Hearn's original pull-req for the Tor blacklist did not include the proxy disable code, which was added later in master. Peter Todd notes that it was sloppy of Mike to be making changes in master that do not correspond to peer-reviewed pull-req code.</p>
