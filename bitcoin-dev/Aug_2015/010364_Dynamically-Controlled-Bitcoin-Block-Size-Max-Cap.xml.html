    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the maximum block size in Bitcoin. Some argue that the only reason for a maximum block size is to prevent spam, while others claim it's to force people into paying higher fees. The latter approach is criticized as counterproductive. A proposal is made to solve the issue of miners sabotaging block size increases by mining empty blocks. This proposal suggests an algorithmic approach where if more than 50% of block size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is more than 90% of the max block size, then the max block size would be doubled. Alternatively, if more than 90% of block size found in the same period is less than 50% of the max block size, then the max block size would be halved. This approach gives miners and end-users a say in setting the max block size, as end-users will fill up the mempool from where miners take transactions to fill up the blocks.</p>
