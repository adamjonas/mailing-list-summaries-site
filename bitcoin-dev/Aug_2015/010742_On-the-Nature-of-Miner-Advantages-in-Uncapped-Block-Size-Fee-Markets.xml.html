    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread begins with Peter R discussing how the fee market will remain healthy as long as block solutions announcements contain information about the transactions included in a block. He refers to the Shannon-Hartley theorem that describes the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a physical communication channel. Matt Corallo responds by pointing out that transaction validation caches and block compression protocols must also be taken into account. He suggests that many large miners already have their own network to relay blocks globally with only a few bytes on the wire at block-time and that there is also the bitcoinrelaynetwork.org network available for smaller miners. The increased orphan risk for including a transaction can be reduced to a very tiny amount making the optimal block size to include everything that is in the mempool of other reasonably large miners.Peter R agrees that this can be fast, but he argues that the orphan risk for including a transaction is related to the validation time and the incentive to not include transactions that have already been relayed around sufficiently is near zero in practice. The discussion then moves to the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols. Peter R explains that his paper includes the effect of block compression protocols (the "coding gain") and that the results hold unless the information about the included transactions is identically zero. Daniele Pinna then submits a paper analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. The main result of the work is a detailed analysis of mining advantages as a function of miner hashrate. It shows how large block subsidies incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to the steady increase of marginal profits as hashrates grow. The paper also shows that part of the large advantage the large miners have today is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class, which has access to expected profits an order of magnitude larger than everyone else. As block subsidies decrease, this high-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit structure that decreases as a function of hashrate.</p>
