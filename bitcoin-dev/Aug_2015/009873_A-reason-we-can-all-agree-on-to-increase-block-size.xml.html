    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the issue of block size and its relationship with the occurrence of consensus forks that require manual intervention. Eric Lombrozo argues that larger blocks are linked to the propensity for consensus forks, and incidents like these are supposed to be fixed by protocol instead of relying on cooperation between core devs and mining pool operators. He also points out that the correct incentives in such cases were not due to people potentially losing a lot of money but were well-intentioned altruism, which is a facade hiding other motivations. On the other hand, Hector Chu believes that cooperation is necessary, especially in rare cases when the system has a bug, and it's better to prioritize the needs of users and make it less expensive and competitive to transact. The debate ultimately highlights the fragility of the distribution by consensus system and the importance of finding a balance between decentralization, trustlessness, technical requirements, and security.</p>
