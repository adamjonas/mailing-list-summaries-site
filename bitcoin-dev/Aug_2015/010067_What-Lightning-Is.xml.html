    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, concerns were raised about the increased cost of the network as it becomes more interconnected. Patrick Strateman clarified that a hub's business is centered around having payment channels open with other hubs or users, and if the hub requires user funds to open these channels, then users have no reason to pay the hub anything in fees. Furthermore, a hub that doesn't use its own funds to open payment channels is useless. Tom Harding responded, predicting that hubs would assess fees for depositing funds, which could vary based on amount deposited and time stayed. He suggested that such fees could be referred to as "all of the above." The conversation ended with links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and sign-up page.</p>
