    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 27, 2015, a discussion occurred on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list between Prabhat and Gavin Andresen. Prabhat had suggested implementing AML-KYC in bitcoin as a solution to control its misuse of vast financial powers. In response, Gavin Andresen opposed any proposal that puts the foundation in a position of centralized authority and said that decentralization is a bedrock principle of Bitcoin. He further added that even if it were technically possible, he would be opposed because the idea that a central organization can be trusted to keep secrets secure is just fundamentally wrong. Additionally, he mentioned recent failures by government organizations such as the NSA and commercial organizations like Ashley Madison in keeping secrets secure.</p>
