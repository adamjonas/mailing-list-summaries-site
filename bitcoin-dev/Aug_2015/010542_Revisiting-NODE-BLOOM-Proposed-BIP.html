    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user questioned the claim that Bloom filter usage has declined significantly. Peter Todd responded with a comment outlining several reasons why this is the case. He noted that SPV clients are moving towards using centralized, trusted servers run by wallet authors such as Mycelium, GreenBits, AirBitz, and Electrum. Additionally, Bloom filters have been found to have severe privacy issues and offer essentially no privacy at all. Furthermore, Bloom filters still have unsolved DoS attack issues that will get significantly worse under upcoming blocksize increase proposals. Todd suggested that the Core implementation accept and respond to bloom filter requests from non-upgraded clients regardless of whether or not NODE_BLOOM was set until some fixed upgrade deadline in the future.</p>
