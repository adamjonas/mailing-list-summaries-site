    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The core developers of Bitcoin have been urged to keep technical discussions related to the development of the cryptocurrency, as opposed to "philosophical" ones. The appeal follows months of debate about a hard fork with respect to block size. The discussion has led to a high volume of emails and emails that are more philosophical than technical, making it almost impossible to use the list for its primary purpose. The message urges individuals to consider the relevance of their email before sending it, and how many times they send emails on the same topic. It also suggests that any philosophical debates should be taken elsewhere, out of respect for the time of hundreds of developers who receive every email.</p>
