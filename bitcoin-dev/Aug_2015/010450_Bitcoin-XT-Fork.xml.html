    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 19, 2015, a discussion was had on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding warnings about the proposed hard fork of Bitcoin. The conversation included comments from Btc Drak and Adam Back, who both claimed to have warned Gavin and Mike that the proposed 75% activation threshold for the hard fork was "optimally bad". Despite these warnings, Gavin and Mike continued with their plans. Btc Drak also mentioned that he had suggested a timeout for the deployment of the hard fork, but Gavin had removed it from his proposal. It is unclear what exact timeline this discussion took place, but it may have been related to a previous email thread from July 2015 where Gavin was one of the few participants.</p>
