    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 18, 2015, Warren Togami Jr. via bitcoin-dev wrote that he doesn't understand the position of Oliver Egginger, but he has a feeling that Egginger is suggesting that Satoshi wouldn't be welcome to return if he wanted to be active in development again. Egginger proposed that it would be easy to block creator's old email addresses using Mailman. Some believe that the email could be genuine and some say that only the content is important. Egginger says that if Satoshi were to return, his words would carry authority and influence the community greatly. However, he believes that whoever speaks shouldn't be treated with such authority as it gives them the power to influence and manipulate people. Egginger highlights the paradox of human nature where dictatorship can make one free.</p>
