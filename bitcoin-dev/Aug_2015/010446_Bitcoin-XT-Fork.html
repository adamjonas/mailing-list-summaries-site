    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, Adam Back sent a message via Bitcoin-dev stating that warnings to Gavin and Mike were ignored regarding the optimal ratio for triggering a hard fork. He stated that many had warned that 75% was an optimally bad trigger ratio and that it is not a miner vote like in soft forks. Back claims to have had ongoing conversations with Gavin and others about this warning. Additionally, Back stated that he also warned Gavin of this during his PR to Bitcoin Core, suggesting a timeout that would cancel the hard fork deployment if activation/enforcement did not occur within. However, Gavin deleted these suggestions from the PR, claiming that thresholds were not relevant to the conversation in his PR.</p>
