    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Jorge Timón, Timón expressed his appreciation for a more reasonable position on the block size limit debate. He wished that this stance had been taken from the beginning, rather than the initial claim that "the block size limit must be increased as soon as possible or bitcoin will fail". Andresen responded by pointing out that such statements are false and do not help the debate. He referred Timón to his first blog post on the issue, where he argued that an increase in the max block size is urgent to prevent an over-saturated network. Andresen also clarified that he never said Bitcoin would fail. Mike, who had also written on the issue, sketched out a worst-case scenario of Bitcoin entering an overload situation and coming out with its reputation and user base heavily damaged. Andresen urged both sides of the debate to stop making exaggerated claims about each other's positions and focus on resolving difficult questions like this in the future.</p>
