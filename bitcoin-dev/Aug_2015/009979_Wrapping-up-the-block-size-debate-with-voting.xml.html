    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is proposing a voting system to determine the future of the cryptocurrency. The proposal outlines several voter groups, including bitcoin miners, bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators. Blockchain-based voting would be conducted using a single transferable vote system, with voters ranking their preferences and eliminating candidates until one remains as the most popular. However, there are concerns about the criteria for eligibility in certain voter groups, and how many bitcoins equate to one vote. Technical issues also need to be addressed, such as verifying identities, collecting votes, and ensuring no double voting occurs.</p>
