    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange among Bitcoin developers in August 2015, Danny Thorpe discussed testing the network's ability to handle hard fork transitions and how larger blocks would affect the network. He clarified that he was referring to the public global testnet blockchain rather than in-house isolated networks. Another developer stated that they expected any uncontroversial hard fork to be deployed in testnet3 before it was deployed in Bitcoin's main chain. They also noted that tests could be conducted using a Github pull request, which did not exist at the time of Rusty's test. The new testchains may have cheap proof-of-work, but they don't need to be tested "in-a-box" and can be run from various locations.</p>
