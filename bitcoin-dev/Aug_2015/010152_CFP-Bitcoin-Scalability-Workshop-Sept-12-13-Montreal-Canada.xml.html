    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an effort to aid the technical consensus building process, a pair of workshops will be held to collect technical criteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with academic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. The first workshop is set to take place in Montreal, Canada on September 12th-13th, 2015, where the general trade-offs and requirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits will be discussed. The purpose of this workshop is to raise awareness of the complex and subtle issues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing proposals, and motivate future work in this area. The second workshop is tentatively scheduled to take place in Hong Kong roughly in the late November to December timeframe, which is intended to be easier for Chinese miners to attend. This workshop will pertain to actual block size proposals and will be used to present and review actual proposals for scaling Bitcoin against the requirements gathered in Phase 1. Multiple competing proposals will be presented, with experimental data, and compared against each other. Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event.Travel, venue details, and accommodation recommendation are available at scalingbitcoin.org. Registration begins August 12th at an early-bird ticket price of $150 USD until September 3rd. There will be an application process for independent or academic researchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to give a presentation. The four underwriters of this event have agreed to jointly review applications and cover the travel subsidies for qualified presenters. Sponsors are still being accepted for this event.</p>
