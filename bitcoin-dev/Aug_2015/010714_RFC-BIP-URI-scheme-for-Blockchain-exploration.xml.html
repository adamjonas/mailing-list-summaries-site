    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed BIP XX suggests using a standard URI scheme for Blockchain exploration that all explorers would understand. The author recommends using a real URI scheme, blockchain://, instead of the bitcoin: scheme to allow the use of normal URL parsing libraries. The author also suggests including the type looking up in the URI to make it more human understandable and give the explorers the ability to optimize what they are looking for when hitting various databases. The BIP could also specify little endian searching and what the return results should look like. The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred tool, whether a web service or local application. Currently, Bitcoin clients usually point to an arbitrary blockchain explorer when the user looks for the details of a transaction. This proposed scheme would eliminate the need for cut-and-paste and provide users with the convenience of always using their preferred explorer, especially on mobile devices. From the perspective of a wallet developer or other tool that needs to show any kind of Blockchain reference, using this scheme means that they can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it without having to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the user to select one. Blockchain explorers, in turn, will offer to handle the blockchain: URI the first time the user visits their website, launches or installs the application, or even sets themselves if there isn't already one.</p>
