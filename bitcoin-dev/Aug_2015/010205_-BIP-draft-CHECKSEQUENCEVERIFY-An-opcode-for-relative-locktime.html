    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joseph Poon, one of the co-authors of the Lightning Network whitepaper, has suggested a potential method to mitigate systemic attacks on the network. He proposes a timestop bit that could be used to flag a block as timestopped, which would then freeze an auxiliary blockheight and not allow it to increment. The auxiliary blockheight would only be used for accounting in timestopped height computation, and wouldn't be used for anything else. Transactions with a timestop bit enabled would have their OP_CSV relative height dependent upon the auxiliary height, rather than the real block height. This would allow a backlog of transactions to occur before a particular (relative) block height entered into the blockchain. Poon notes that this method is in addition to any current mitigations being developed, and suggests the possibility of considering additional states with relative height computation.</p>
