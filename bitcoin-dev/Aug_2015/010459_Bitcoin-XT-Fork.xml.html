    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding Gavin Andresen's commit access for the Bitcoin Core repository has taken place. It was noted that normal GitHub users submitting pull-reqs to Bitcoin Core are not allowed to delete other users' comments on their own pull-reqs. However, Gavin Andresen did censor another user's posts which raised concerns about his responsibility of having commit access. The discussion concluded that if he censors others, it's inconsistent with the responsibility of having commit access.</p>
