        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread from August 13, 2015, Nicolas Dorier expressed his desire to have a proposal combining BIP68, CLTV, and CSV. He believed that if BIP68 was included in the next fork, implementing CSV would be an easy decision. Dorier also inquired about any competing RCLTV proposals that did not rely on BIP68 for information. In response, Matt explained that all such proposals had been abandoned because the current proposal appeared to be a better idea. However, he encouraged anyone to revive or create a new proposal.Dorier's suggestion was to implement CSV (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) alongside CLTV (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and BIP68 (relative lock-time). He believed that if BIP68 was included in the next fork, implementing CSV would be straightforward. However, there was uncertainty about whether there were any competing proposals for RCLTV (Relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) that did not depend on BIP68 for information. The availability of information on this topic seemed limited.</p>
