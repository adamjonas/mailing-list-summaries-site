    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Hector Chu and Tom discuss the workings of payment hubs in the context of Bitcoin channels. Chu explains that when money is debited from a payment hub, it is simultaneously credited by either another payment hub or the person making the payment. However, Chu also explains that this only describes steady-state dynamics, and that there is actually hub funding required to initiate and maintain the ability to receive payments. For example, if Bob opens a channel at his hub but doesn't use it for spending, and Alice sends 1 BTC to the channel, her payment can only be applied if the hub has funded the channel with at least 1 BTC. The hub receives an offsetting payment from Alice in another channel, but to make this work, it must subject 1 BTC to shared control with Bob and forfeit the use of that money for other purposes (opportunity cost) while the channel is open. Chu likens this opportunity cost to gold lease rates in the LN paper and predicts that the rates charged to consumers for BTC credit will likely be much closer to today's BTC borrowing rates. Therefore, burying this cost in general fees might not work very well because different Bobs may want different maximum payment amounts, and channels may be open for different lengths of time.</p>
