    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the possibility of adjusting the difficulty for individual blocks based on their relative size to the average block size of the previous difficulty period. This would allow for an increase in block size as usage grew, but would also result in longer confirmation times. It is argued that if it takes 5% longer to find a block, but that block contains 5% more transactions, then it is essentially the same. However, the concern arises when considering that the blocks will be bigger for the next difficulty period. The suggestion is made to dynamically adjust the max blocksize instead. It is noted that this could cause the difficulty to fluctuate depending on the amount of transactions and fees being paid, but it is unclear if this would have a significant impact in the long run. There is also a concern that this could potentially open up the system to attacks from someone willing to lose money. Overall, the feedback is deemed helpful.</p>
