    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Danny proposes to remove the reduction step in the calculation of max block size, making it a monotonic increasing function. Upal Chakraborty argues against the notion that a miner with 11% of hash power could sabotage block size increases by only ever mining empty blocks, stating that it is not economical as they would lose transaction fees and miners would switch pools. He proposes a slightly modified technical solution to the problem in an algorithmic format, where if more than 50% of block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is more than 90% of MaxBlockSize, then the MaxBlockSize is doubled. If more than 90% of block's size found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period is less than 50% of MaxBlockSize, then the MaxBlockSize is halved. Otherwise, the MaxBlockSize remains the same. This approach allows both miners and end-users to have their say, as end-users fill up the mempool from where miners take Tx to fill up the blocks.</p>
