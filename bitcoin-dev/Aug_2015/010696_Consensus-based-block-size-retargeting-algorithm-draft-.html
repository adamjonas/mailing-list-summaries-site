    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This proposal is being praised as the best one yet for addressing several issues faced by previous proposals. It tackles the problem of miners selling their block-size votes and blindly predicting future market needs versus technological capacities. The proposal starts with a 1-MB limit to avoid a large step discontinuity in the block-size limit and throttles changes to Â±10% every 2016 blocks. Additionally, it imposes a tangible cost on miners who vote to raise the block-size limit and avoids incentivizing them to lower it. However, one important question remains unanswered: What is the mechanism for activation of the new consensus rule? This proposal is available on the BIP-CBBRSA GitHub repository.</p>
