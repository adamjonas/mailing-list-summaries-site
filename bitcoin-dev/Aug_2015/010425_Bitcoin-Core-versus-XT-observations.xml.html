    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The blocksize issue in Bitcoin is causing uncertainty among investors and those who start companies. However, people who invest directly in Bitcoin seem to enjoy these challenges. The recent Greek debt crisis led some to believe that Bitcoin could be used as a replacement currency, resulting in a spike in price, which the author took advantage of by selling some of their coins. Now, with reports of Bitcoin splitting in two, the price has dropped, allowing the author to buy back their coins. It's important to consider "developer attacks" when discussing the future of Bitcoin.</p>
