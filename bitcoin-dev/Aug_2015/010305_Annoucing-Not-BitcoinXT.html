    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2015 post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo expressed concern over proposals for a hard fork in the Bitcoin protocol. He noted that Bitcoin had never attempted anything like this before and that even uncontroversial soft forks had caused problems in the past. Lombrozo argued that attempting a hard fork in such a politically divisive environment could lead to serious problems and cause a rift between different factions within the Bitcoin community. He suggested that any changes should be tested on a far less controversial issue first, rather than risking billions of dollars' worth of other people's money. In response to his post, others on the mailing list argued that competition was healthy and that Bitcoin's stability should not depend on the good will of anyone. Some accused the developers of trying to stay in power and imposing their will on the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
