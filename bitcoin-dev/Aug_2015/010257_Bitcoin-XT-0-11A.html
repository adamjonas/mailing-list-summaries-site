    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has become heated over the proposed fork of the Bitcoin Core project, specifically the block size limit. Mike Hearn, a developer for the Bitcoin XT project, has released a bigger blocks patch set in response to what he believes is a failure by Bitcoin Core to serve the interests of users. However, this move has been met with strong opposition from many developers, who believe that forking the open-source cryptocurrency would be too risky. In particular, Eric Lombrozo argues that there are serious concerns about permanently splitting the ledger and losing people's money. Additionally, Ken Friece accuses Blockstream, an investor in Bitcoin Core, of having a conflict of interest because it stands to profit from limiting the block size and promoting off-chain transactions like the Lightning Network. In response, Mark Friedenbach denies any profit motive behind working on Lightning and argues that the protocol is entirely peer-to-peer and open source. Overall, the debate highlights the challenges of achieving consensus in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency development.</p>
