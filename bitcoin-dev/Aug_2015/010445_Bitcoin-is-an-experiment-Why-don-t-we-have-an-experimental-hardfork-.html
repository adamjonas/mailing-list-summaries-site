    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about hardfork deployment in bitcoin's main chain, it was suggested that any uncontroversial hardfork should first be deployed in testnet3 before being implemented. The purpose of testing in this manner is to verify the network's ability to handle such transitions and how larger blocks may affect the network. It was clarified that when referring to testnet, the public global testnet blockchain is meant, not isolated networks like testnet-in-a-box. However, it was noted that tests can already be conducted using Github pull request #6382. Even if new testchains are regtest-like (cheap proof of work), they do not need to be tested "in-a-box" and can be run from various locations. Rusty's test could have been made using #6382, but it did not exist at the time.</p>
