    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the proposal of an experimental hardfork to test the network's capability in handling transitions and how larger blocks affect it. The suggestion is to deploy a block size limit experiment for long-term trials using the public global testnet blockchain to collect data for future hardforks. The idea is to show the world that reaching a consensus for a Bitcoin hardfork is possible, and if successful, there would be more in the future. The proposal suggests a scheduled experimental hardfork with three objectives - to collect data for future hardforks, to slightly relieve the pressure of full block, and most importantly, to show that reaching consensus for a Bitcoin hardfork is possible. The proposal recommends adopting a backup plan if no other consensus could be reached before February 1, 2016, where block size would increase to 1.5MB 30 days after 80% miner approval but not before June 1, 2016. The backup plan aims to ensure that every full node has enough time to upgrade after the actual hardfork date is confirmed. It also suggests finding a better solution before December 31, 2017, with one and a half years of data and further debate. The community as a whole could agree with this experimental hardfork, and the plan could be announced on bitcoin.org, and coding of the patch could begin immediately. If no further consensus could be reached, a new version of Bitcoin Core with the patch would be released on or before February 1, 2016, and everyone would be asked to upgrade immediately.</p>
