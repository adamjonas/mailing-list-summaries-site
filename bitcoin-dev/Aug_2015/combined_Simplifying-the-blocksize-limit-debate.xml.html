        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The ongoing debate surrounding the 1 MB block size limit in Bitcoin has sparked various assumptions and observations. While developers acknowledge the need to eventually increase the limit, they also want to reduce the number of policy decisions made by bitcoin-core. Keeping the limit is considered the most conservative option for the $4 billion system that is Bitcoin. However, significant advancements in bandwidth, CPU, and storage have led to a decrease in the block size limit, despite no official increase being implemented. Despite this, it is possible to adjust the limit for technological growth without impacting current decentralization. While increasing the block size limit will always require a hard-fork, decreasing or stopping its growth can be achieved via a soft-fork. It is crucial to note that underestimating the need for a larger block size limit may lead to more difficult problems down the line. Overall, future technological advancements offer optimism for the potential growth of Bitcoin. Developers must balance the need for increased block size limits with maintaining the system's integrity and avoiding unnecessary policy decisions.</p>
