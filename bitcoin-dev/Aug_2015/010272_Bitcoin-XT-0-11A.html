    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin community has expressed their disdain for the attempt at a takeover by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, calling it "foul play". They suggest an alternative method of voting through coinbase scriptSig or BIP 100, which would require devs to react if the majority was obtained. Another member of the community has warned about the potential risks of a "node war" between factions supporting different versions of Bitcoin, stating that it could make transactions risky and plummet confidence in the system. They also note that any disagreement between the network and economic actors such as exchanges could lead to a significant drop in the value of BTC.</p>
