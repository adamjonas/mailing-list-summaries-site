    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Jorge Tim√≥n suggests that technical people tend to avoid noise on mailing lists while non-technical people follow the noise. Bryan Bishop responds, stating he is fine with receiving everything through a single mailing list. He likens it to reading the Wikipedia firehose of recent edits and thinks having a raw feed would be valuable for future developers. However, he also suggests that weekly summaries of research and development activity would be useful to summarize recent work. He expected to see more "individual developer's summaries of things they have found interesting over the past 30-90 days or past year" digging up arcane details from the mailing list archives, or more infrequent summaries of the other smaller batched review emails. He suggests that summarizing activity would be more valuable for this community rather than digest mode mailing list consumption.</p>
