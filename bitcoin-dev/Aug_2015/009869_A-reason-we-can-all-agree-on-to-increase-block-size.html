    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on August 3, 2015, Adam Back emphasized that the block size debate should focus on scientific evaluation, technical requirements, and security rather than political or business compromises. However, another participant in the conversation argued that the block size is a political issue as it affects all users, not just technically inclined ones, and that most users prefer a hit to node count in the short term over expensive and competitive transactions. The participant also expressed the need for faith in the system's ability to readjust after the move to big blocks while maintaining decentralization and trustlessness. Despite differing opinions, the incentives of Bitcoin will continue to guide decisions throughout the system, from miners to merchants and users.</p>
