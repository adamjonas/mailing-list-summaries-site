    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 21, 2015, Btc Drak proposed extending a site to include major stakeholders like service providers and mining pools. The context of the proposal was blockchains' inability to scale efficiently. Andersen described increasing block size as "kicking the can down the road," which highlights the consensus that blockchains don't scale well. Service providers were asked about their long-term growth plans regarding this issue. However, no further information is given beyond this email exchange.</p>
