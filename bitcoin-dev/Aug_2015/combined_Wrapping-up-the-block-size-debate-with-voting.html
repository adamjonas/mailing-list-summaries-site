        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2015, the Bitcoin-dev mailing list started a debate on how to make changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. Pieter Wuille argued that Bitcoin's consensus rules are a consensus system and not a democracy, suggesting that if people want a majority to decide on a currency's economic policy, they should use fiat currencies instead. Meanwhile, a proposal was presented to end the discussion on Bitcoin's economic policy through voting. The proposal suggested several voter groups, including miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators, each with different eligibility criteria and voting rules.Single transferable vote was applied, and technical issues were discussed, such as the need for a trusted person to verify voters' identities and the possibility of double voting. In another post, the need for testing and scenario simulation of proposals before voting and implementation was emphasized, and the potential implications of global credit contraction or natural disaster on usage, scale, decentralization, and security were discussed.Recently, Venzen suggested that proposals should be tested and scenario simulated with published results before going straight to voting and implementation. In response, jl2012 proposed a comprehensive voting system for different stakeholder groups, which includes eligibility criteria, voting procedure, and interpretation of results. The voter groups include miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full nodes operators. The votes will be counted independently, and each group has its own eligibility criteria.The proposal also addressed technical issues, such as voting by miners, developers, exchanges, and merchants being the easiest and needing a trusted person to verify voters' identity. For bitcoin holders, an automatic system may be needed to collect and count the votes. Double voting was not allowed, and people were not allowed to change their mind after voting. The proposal allows people to have multiple roles in the Bitcoin ecology and vote in all applicable categories since they were contributing more than other people. However, there are concerns about the criteria for eligibility in certain voter groups, and how many bitcoins equate to one vote.The Bitcoin community is proposing a voting system to determine the future of the cryptocurrency. The proposal outlines several voter groups, including bitcoin miners, bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full node operators. Blockchain-based voting would be conducted using a single transferable vote system, with voters ranking their preferences and eliminating candidates until one remains as the most popular.However, there are concerns about the criteria for eligibility in certain voter groups, and how many bitcoins equate to one vote. Technical issues also need to be addressed, such as verifying identities, collecting votes, and ensuring no double voting occurs. The Bitcoin community is proposing a voting system to determine the future of the cryptocurrency, but further discussions and improvements are needed before implementing any changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules.The proposed solution to the block size debate in Bitcoin is to increase it by 8MB and 40% annually, with the option for miners to cap their blocks at a lower amount if necessary. The proposal suggests putting an end to the endless debate regarding Bitcoin development by voting on concrete proposals. The candidate proposals must be complete BIPs with reference implementation ready to merge immediately, approved by developers in a technical standpoint without political or philosophical considerations. Several voter groups will participate in the voting process independently. The email thread discusses various voting systems to be implemented in the Bitcoin development process. The outcome of voting may not necessarily be a binding decision but voters need to recognize that failing to find a middle ground could mean they get their way but they split the community.</p>
