    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In August 2015, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list named Oliver Egginger posed a question about whether or not the community would have discussed a particular post if it had not been claimed to have come from Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite the controversy surrounding the identity of Satoshi, Egginger stated that he learned something important from the post and was glad it was shared. He did note, however, that the signal-to-noise ratio on the mailing list was quite poor at the time, making it difficult to filter out useful information from the noise. Egginger expressed gratitude for threaded mail user agents which make it easier to organize email threads.</p>
