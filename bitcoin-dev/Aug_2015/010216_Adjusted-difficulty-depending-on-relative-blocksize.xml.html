    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Jakob Rönnbäck and Anthony Towns on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discusses the idea of adjusting the difficulty of individual blocks based on their size relative to the average block size of the previous difficulty period. Towns expresses concern that this would result in longer confirmation times as block sizes increase, which could be problematic for those looking for a high number of confirmations. Rönnbäck suggests that if the increase in confirmation time due to harder blocks is also reflected in decreased difficulty, it would be simpler to dynamically adjust the maximum block size instead. However, Towns points out that this could potentially lead to attacks by bad actors who mine valid empty or small blocks at minimum hash rate, causing a reorg and allowing for double-spends.</p>
