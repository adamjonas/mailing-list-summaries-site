    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris Pacia and Peter Todd had a conversation regarding the use of bloom filters in wallets. Peter Todd mentioned that some wallets such as Mycelium are not using bloom filters but rather SPV verification of block headers with lookup servers, which has been popular. However, Chris Pacia shared that he spoke to a Mycelium employee who said they were considering moving to SPV/bloom because of server issues mentioned by Andreas. Chris Pacia believes that it would be foolish for Mycelium to move exclusively over to SPV/bloom since their existing design was safe to use during the recent fork, unlike Android Wallet. Moreover, he has yet to see any issues raised with implementing NODE_BLOOM that will adversely affect such wallets.</p>
