        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer named xor has suggested on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that the argument about block size should be delegated to a self-adjusting system. The developer believes that constantly tweaking a Satoshi-given constant is not effective and an automated system would be more suitable. The proposed solution involves using an averaging function based on previous block sizes to determine the new max block size, indicating that systems that do not require human intervention are more beautiful when designing a decentralized P2P network. The aim of this proposal is to end the flamewar and continue with real development. Xor works for the Freenet anonymous P2P network. Overall, the post emphasizes the beauty and effectiveness of automated systems in decentralized networks.</p>
