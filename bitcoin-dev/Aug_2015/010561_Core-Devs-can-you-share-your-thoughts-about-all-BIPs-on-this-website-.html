    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The website in question here is a tool, a portal that educates people and allows them to link all their thoughts about various BIPs and show it to others. The website accepts HTML so linking to other posts made elsewhere is also possible. When you click on a cell in the grid, it forwards you to the page that the developer edited for this BIP. The opinions are browse-able from the same website and as soon as one of those proposals reaches consensus, it can be noticed. However, the most controversial BIPs tend to make more noise at the expense of those which are not controversial, like SIPA's BIP. The debate in the public mind is mostly "XT or not" and "bigger blocks or not", however, there are many different proposals that might also reach consensus but are lost in the noise. Any BIP that at least one voter approves and wants to push forward can be added to the website. The plan is to add merchants, wallet providers, and mining pools later. In response to a suggestion by Btc Drak, Peter Todd suggests that devs should explain what their threat models are and what should be at the root of their thinking about the block size. The "Technical Opinion" column on the website is designed for this purpose, but Todd believes that being more explicit would be valuable.</p>
