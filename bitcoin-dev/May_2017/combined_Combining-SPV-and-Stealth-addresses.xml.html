        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses the combination of Stealth Addresses with Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) protocol, but has not arrived at a satisfying conclusion. SPV allows thin clients to put their public keys in a bloom filter and request Merkle proofs from full nodes for transactions related to those keys, thus providing privacy to the client. On the other hand, Stealth Addresses enable receiver privacy by allowing the sender to derive a one-time pubkey for the recipient to recover the payment. The author's idea is to combine these two methods so that stealth addresses can be used on smartphones without losing privacy. However, the full node needs the private scanning key d to check if a transaction belongs to a pubkey (Q,R), which raises privacy concerns.Various ideas were presented, such as modifying the scheme to ensure that d is kept private or applying multiparty computation, but they were deemed costly. Another idea involved search functionality without leaking the search pattern, but it was also believed to be unfeasible since the full node still needs to compute on the data it has found and retrieve the whole Merkle proofs. While it was suggested that using two pushes in op_return may offer decent privacy, filter matches on outgoing transactions are still needed to build a functioning wallet.A discussion on combining Stealth addresses with SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) was initiated by Henning Kopp via bitcoin-dev mailing list. SPV is a mechanism in which a thin client puts his public keys in a bloom filter and asks a full node to give him Merkle proofs of all transactions whose pubkey are in the bloom filter. This gives privacy to the thin client, as the full node cannot detect if a specific transaction belongs to the thin client. Meanwhile, Stealth addresses enable receiver privacy, where the sender of a transaction derives a one-time pubkey to which he sends the money and the receiver can check if the money was sent to him and recover the one-time private key.The post ends with a challenge to the community for better ideas as the community is seeking better ideas for combining stealth addresses with SPV.</p>
