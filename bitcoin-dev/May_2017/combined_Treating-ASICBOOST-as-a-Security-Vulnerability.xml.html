        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The vulnerability known as ASIC boost is a protocol vulnerability that exploits the design of Bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm. It violates the assumptions of every execution of the proof-of-work function being independent and creates unfair advantages in Bitcoin mining, leading to layer-violations and creating perverse system incentives. The use of ASICBOOST is criticized for doing multiple checks in parallel, which violates the independence of each hash when performing work.Cameron Garnham expressed concern that ASICBOOST violates two security assumptions of the Bitcoin PoW function and recommends that the vulnerability be assigned a CVE. The Bitcoin developers have assigned a CVE identifier, CVE-2017-9230, for the security vulnerability known as ASICBOOST. The vulnerability falls under Cryptocurrency Mining Algorithm Weakness and Cryptocurrency Proof-of-Work Algorithm Weakness.Some individuals argue that the use of ASICBOOST is not an exploit, but rather an optimization. Nonetheless, bits in the block header have been discovered which could be used for dual meanings and at least one meaning does not preserve the incentive balances intended and assumed by others. This creates an unexpected incentive to block protocol improvements, leading to a vulnerability that must be addressed.The Bitcoin Community is discussing possible solutions for the issue. A post on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List suggests adding extra data in the Coinbase Transaction, locking the Version, locking the lower-bits on the Timestamp, and making a deterministic ordering of transaction chains within a block. However, there are concerns that some of these solutions could break existing hardware.In conclusion, the writer suggests that a CVE should be assigned to the vulnerability exploited by ASIC boost and seen as an attack on Bitcoin's security assumptions and considered an exploit of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Function. One principled way to proceed would be to fault not the exploit, but the protocol design. The hashing work specified possibly could gain from blocking development work, making it clear grounds for taking action without any delay. It is recommended that the Bitcoin community fix this vulnerability with expediency while closely aligning with industry standards.</p>
