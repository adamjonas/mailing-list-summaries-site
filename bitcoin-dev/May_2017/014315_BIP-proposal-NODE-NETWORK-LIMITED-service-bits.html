    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The draft proposal by Jonas Schnelli suggests a BIP to improve the signaling of valuable services by pruned peers. The proposal includes advising clients to use peers with headroom, as estimates could be incorrect and cause reorgs. Reorgs are not the only concern for larger numbers; sometimes there are more blocks in 24 hours than expected. Nodes should also be willing to serve headers for their entire best chain. The third depth level is left undefined for sending, but should be treated as at least 1152 blocks by receivers. When switching to NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_X, nodes should treat them identically to NODE_NETWORK in peer selection to avoid topology distortion. In terms of making room, a node network peer could choose to disconnect the least useful peers that aren't syncing from them to make more room for ones that are. This lets them decide what connections they want, based on how full they are and what is useful to them, rather than finding themselves all lonely because nodes decided to avoid them to be helpful. Feedback is welcome on the proposal.</p>
