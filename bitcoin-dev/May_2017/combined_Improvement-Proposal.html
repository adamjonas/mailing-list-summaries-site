        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to allow users to connect and participate in the BTC blockchain network without mining. The improvement proposal suggests allowing users' devices, including mobile and IoT devices, to connect and participate in the same network. The incentive for these participants could be a lottery schema running in parallel to mining within the same network and on the blockchain. A lucky participant user or miner would be randomly rewarded every specific period of time. However, participants would need to pay the price on each connection round.The proposal suggested a lottery system that would run parallel to mining, with rewards given to lucky participants randomly at specific intervals of time. However, Yann pointed out that Sybil attacks could prevent this from working, even if there was some way to prove that an entity performed the transaction validation. Proving the relay of transaction data to others is also vulnerable to sybil attack. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the proposal will be implemented.</p>
