    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 22, 2017, shaolinfry via bitcoin-dev shared the Barry Silbert agreement, which was forged between a select number of participants. The agreement proposed that changing the bit used to signal could be used as a way to trick people into changing node software ASAP to support the hard-fork code. This would mean that other software wouldn't support segwit, and users would have to upgrade right away. James Hilliard suggested a fourth option, which was to make BIP148 miner triggered (MASF) with a lower threshold above 50%. This proposal wouldn't have the same effect as the Barry Silbert agreement because it's compatible with the existing segwit protocol once activated. However, the author smells political engineering at play. Peter Todd's signature.asc digital signature was also included in the context.</p>
