    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, ZmnSCPxj argues that it is economically logical for some people to pay fees to others with better Bitcoin to hashrate conversion rates rather than suffering a lower conversion rate due to differences in electricity rates depending on country. However, the author of the message disagrees, stating that this is simply an argument for all people to pay one person to mine and that donating to a miner in the hope of some action is a total loss compared to mining for oneself. The author also questions the idea of representative government proposed by ZmnSCPxj, asking how the votes would be distributed democratically. Finally, the author concludes that ZmnSCPxj's political argument wrapped in appeal to emotion is pointless in this context.</p>
