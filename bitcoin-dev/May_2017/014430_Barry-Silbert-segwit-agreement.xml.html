    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to trigger BIP141 signaling instead of directly activating SegWit. The proposal suggests using Bit 4 (or Bit 5) to signal support for "SegWit now, hard fork (to be determined) at scheduled date (Nov 23?)." If Bit 4 support reaches 80%, it would lock in the scheduled hard fork and immediately activate Bit 1 (BIP141 support). However, the aggressive timeline proposed by Barry et al is unlikely to meet the requirements of a multi-billion-dollar system. It is suggested that continued research into meeting the spirit, not the text, of their agreement seems warranted. The use of James' BIP91 instead of Barry's proposal would make the deployment slightly more realistic, although hard fork code should be readily available at this point to meet the timeline. While the proposal may minimize incompatibility with existing nodes, problems such as an aggressive hard fork schedule and possible chain splits between SegWit2MB and BIP141 nodes remain.</p>
