    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list was about the ability of non-native English speakers to communicate BTC addresses with English speakers. Peter Todd explained that it is not a binary issue as some non-native speakers may know how to pronounce numbers or alphabetical characters but not special characters. For instance, he mentioned the case of French speakers who can understand BTC addresses encoded with bech32, but not with any encoding using special characters. In recent weeks, two new reference implementations (Haskell and Rust) have been contributed and C++ and Go ones are underway. Peter Todd also shared his experience of doing a partial rust implementation of Bech32 encoding for a prototype non-BTC use-case and found it very straight-forward.</p>
