    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of paying someone to mine Bitcoin on your behalf. One person argues that each individual can mine and earn money without the need to pay someone else, which saves on fees and allows for individual levels of influence. However, the issue lies in the fact that it is cheaper for some individuals to convert Bitcoin to hashrate than it is for others due to differences in electricity rates by country. Thus, paying someone with better Bitcoin to hashrate conversion via fees may be more economically logical for some. The other person argues that reducing the complexities of mining and validation should be the focus of developers rather than finding ways for people to avoid participating in these distributed roles. Additionally, the assumption that all people are equal or that a person paid x10 more is strictly superior is flawed as it does not take into account skill and ability, but rather the country one is born in.</p>
