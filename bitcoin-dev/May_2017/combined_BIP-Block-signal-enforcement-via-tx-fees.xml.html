        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Luke Dashjr has proposed a new BIP draft for OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION to allow the community to put economic pressure on miners to deploy softforks without the extreme of a UASF. Due to the potential for miners to maliciously block this softfork, it is suggested that we deploy it using BIP 8 to ensure it eventually activates even if encountering hostility. This is intended to be an alternative to BIP 8 in the long term. It is NOT intended to make BIP 148 obsolete, given the timeframes involved. An implementation is available (based on top of BIP 115's implementation). To add a timeout a user can optionally bundle a pair of similar transactions. One with the transaction version bits set and a second with a locktime set. The effect is the same. Another approach to ensuring the timeout might be to simply use input height. That's compatible with bit reuse. It means you can't directly use a bunch of old coins on their own to incentivize miner signaling -- you need to include a coin from after starttime. The above is a "fail-open" timeout rather than "fail-closed". If you signal for foo, but your transaction doesn't get mined because too few miners are signaling foo, and then foo fails to activate and times out, your transaction can then be mined by the miners that didn't signal.</p>
