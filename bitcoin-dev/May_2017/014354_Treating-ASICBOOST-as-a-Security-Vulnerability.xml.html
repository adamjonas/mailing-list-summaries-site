    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The vulnerability known as ASIC boost is a protocol vulnerability that makes Bitcoin resistant to current and future modifications necessary for preserving decentralization. This alone should be enough to prioritize a swift preventative measure. Some individuals argue that the use of ASIC boost is not an exploit, but rather an optimization. However, others contend that bits in the block header have been discovered which could be used for dual meanings and at least one meaning does not preserve the incentive balances intended and assumed by others, creating an unexpected incentive to block protocol improvements. This creates a vulnerability that must be addressed. One principled way to proceed would be to fault not the exploit, but the protocol design. The hashing work specified possibly could gain from blocking development work, making it clear grounds for taking action without any delay. A CVE should be assigned to the vulnerability exploited by ASIC boost and seen as an attack on Bitcoin's security assumptions and considered an exploit of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Function.</p>
