    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Based on the context provided, there is a concern about the failure probabilities being high, especially when an active attacker targets nodes carrying less commonly available blocks. To address this issue, one suggestion is for nodes to use the same mechanism as attackers to determine less commonly available blocks. The proposal is to store a random percentage of these blocks in addition to a deterministic random set and a patch/fill set to deter attacks. This solution aims to increase the availability of less commonly available blocks by having nodes store them in a random percentage along with a deterministic random set. The patch/fill set is also proposed to deter active attackers. This approach could potentially reduce failure probabilities and improve the overall reliability of the system. However, it remains to be seen if this proposal will be implemented and how effective it will be in practice.</p>
