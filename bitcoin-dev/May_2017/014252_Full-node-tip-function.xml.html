    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea is to encourage users who download the block chain from a full node to send a tip to the peers that served them, with a recommended amount of 10mbit. Full nodes can also require a tip for downloading the blockchain, which may be a barrier for some people in hosting their own full node due to the additional cost. However, as long as the full node remains online, the user should receive their money back and more, providing an incentive for quality, long-term hosting. This approach could discourage "installation spam" attacks on the network and encourage stable nodes to stick around longer. If successful, fees for other node operations can be considered in the future.</p>
