    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Sergio Demian Lerner, Johnson Lau and Hampus Sj√∂berg on May 9th and 10th, 2017 was focused on the idea of changing the discount for segregated witness (SegWit) transactions in Bitcoin. Lerner suggests a soft-fork to a 50% discount now, with the option to soft-fork again to a 75% discount later if needed, as it wouldn't affect the maximum number of transactions per second. Johnson Lau notes that any parameter could be changed in a hardfork, so it is not related to the current BIP141 proposal and that the 75% discount could still be used in a soft-fork and changed in a hardfork later. Lerner also states that he believes the current transaction pattern will shift towards multisigs in the future, and that a 75% discount is a good idea for scaling without a hardfork, but it could be risky if a 2X blocksize increase hardfork were to occur in the future. He suggests a 50% discount instead to avoid making the worst-case block size 8 Mbytes when it could have been 5.4 Mbytes. However, in order to change from 50% to 75%, a hardfork would be necessary, whereas changing from 75% to 50% would only require a softfork or a pre-scheduled change. This would reduce the maximum transactions per second with a 50% discount and also reduce the incentive to spend witness UTXO.</p>
