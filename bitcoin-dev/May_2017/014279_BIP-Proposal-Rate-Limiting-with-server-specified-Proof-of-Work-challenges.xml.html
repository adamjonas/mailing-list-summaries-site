    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a new feature to limit the rate of connections using arbitrary proof of work (PoW) challenges has been put forth by Karl Johan Alm. The feature would allow nodes to create and solve various PoW challenges in exchange for connection slots, which could later be expanded to cover other DoS risky services such as bloom filters. Two proofs of work, sha256 and cuckoo-cycle, have been included in the BIP which can be combined in different ways. This could help prevent DDOS attacks and generate revenue streams for nodes. The proposal can be found on GitHub and feedback is welcome.</p>
