    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Sergio Demian Lerner suggested that the non-witness data weight factor should be 2.35 instead of 4, which would lead to a 50% witness discount. However, this suggestion was met with criticism as it does not take into account the relative cost of UTXO bloat. The non-witness factor should be as large as possible because witness data has little to no long-term cost to the system and eventually, the system's survival will require transitioning to starting from a state snapshot. The hyperbolic increase in worst-case bandwidth cannot be ignored. If anything, the non-witness factor should be towards five, instead of lower values. In response to Lerner's suggestion, someone asked for the location of the Bitcoinj source code as they had not found it readable.</p>
