    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner discussed the potential capacity of SegWit(50%)+2MbHF. According to him, this combination can provide 50% more capacity than SegWit alone, while still maintaining the same maximum block size. However, he also pointed out that this combination has twice the UTXO bloat potential with reduced costs. This can lead to gutting most of the gains from weight and making something incompatible. Lerner explained that even the page on segwit.org states that values are selected to balance worst case costs, not to optimize one to the total exclusion of others. He further added that raw size is not very relevant in the long run, but if the goal were to optimize for it, then the limit should be pure size.</p>
