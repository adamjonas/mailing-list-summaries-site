    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Erik Aronesty has stated that linking a Bit4 MASF with a Bit4 "lock in of a hard fork in 6 months" is not possible for basic engineering reasons. The modifications to Bitcoin Core would take at most a day to do, plus a week to test. He believes that progress should not be disrupted by nebulous problems. However, miners have agreed to the SegWit part of the compromise made in New York. Tom Zander argues that calling this disingenuous is not helpful because both parties had to make compromises they were not entirely happy with. He also disputes the claim that miners support SegWit because if they did, they would be signaling for it today instead of distracting the community with fake proposals that have no peer-reviewed code.</p>
