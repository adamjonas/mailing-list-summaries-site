    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is skepticism that bit4 MASF, a proposed mechanism for increasing the block size limit in Bitcoin, will be linked with a "lock in of a hard fork in 6 months" due to basic engineering reasons. Spoonet is seen as a better candidate for the code base, but supporters of bit4 MASF appear unwilling to contribute any work towards it. Some have suggested that if they truly had millions for development, they could simply hire developers to build it correctly. Meanwhile, there are concerns that miners who claim to support SegWit are not signaling for it today and instead distracting the community with proposals that lack peer-reviewed code. Furthermore, Cameron Garnham's suggestion that ASICBOOST is responsible for the political stalemate over SegWit has been met with criticism from Tom Zander, who questions the evidence supporting such an accusation.</p>
