    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jacob Eliosoff via bitcoin-dev proposed a question on May 26, 2017, regarding the Silbert/NYC Segwit2MB proposal's lock-in. He questioned whether if it triggered BIP141 signaling, and turned on bit 1 (BIP141 support) immediately after reaching 80% support for "segwit now, HF (TBD) at scheduled date (Nov 23?)," would it avoid incompatibility with existing BIP141 nodes and get segwit activated sooner. Matt Corallo responded to the proposal stating that it would be similar to BIP91 tied to the Barry-bit-4/5/whatever proposal. He also mentioned that the Barry et al proposal is unlikely to meet the requirements of a multi-billion-dollar system due to their aggressive timeline. Jacob Eliosoff through his proposal focused on minimizing the incompatibility with existing nodes. However, Matt Corallo's response suggested continued research into meeting the spirit, not the text, of their agreement. Jacob's suggestion differed from BIP91 in that there's no orphaning. Just when Segwit2MB support reaches 80%, those 80% join everyone else in signaling for BIP141. BIP91 orphaning is an optional addition but my guess is it wouldn't be needed.</p>
