    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 12, 2017, Luke Dashjr proposed a new BIP draft for OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION to put economic pressure on miners to deploy softforks without the extreme of a UASF. However, Peter Todd disagreed with this proposal claiming that nVersion signaling is already technically unenforceable and users ultimately adopt rules, not miners. He further added that paying miners to signal certain bits will confuse the point and likely lead to the breakdown of the honesty of the nVersion signalling system, currently enforced only by "gentlemans agreement". Instead, Todd suggested a direct coin-owner signalling process, with users taking action based on what provable coin-ownership has signalled. Additionally, he criticized the inadequacy and unreadability of English language specifications, suggesting that the "reference implementation" should be marked as the specification.</p>
