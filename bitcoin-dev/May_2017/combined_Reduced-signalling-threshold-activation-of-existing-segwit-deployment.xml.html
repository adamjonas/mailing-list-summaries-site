        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made by James Hilliard via bitcoin-dev mailing list to activate the existing BIP9 segregated witness (segwit) deployment with a majority hashpower less than 95%. The aim is to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of segwit at the 80% threshold using bit 4. By activating segwit immediately and separately from any HF, we can scale quickly without risking a rushed combined segwit+HF that would almost certainly cause widespread issues.The proposal suggests implementing the first part of the Barry Silbert proposal, which activates Segregated Witness (segwit) at an 80% threshold using bit 4. This is meant to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of segwit. The proposal provides a method for activating the existing BIP9 segwit deployment with a majority hash power less than 95%.While this bip is active users should either upgrade to segsignal or wait for additional confirmations when accepting payments. Miners will need to upgrade their nodes to support segsignal otherwise they may build on top of an invalid block. The proposal is compatible with the existing "segwit" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016 and midnight November 15th, 2017.The document specifies that all blocks must set the nVersion header top three bits to 001 together with bit field (1<<4), thus signaling for the segwit deployment. Historically, IsSuperMajority() has been used to activate soft forks such as BIP66 which has a mandatory signaling requirement for miners once activated, this ensures that miners are aware of new rules being enforced. This technique can be leveraged to lower the signaling threshold of a soft fork while it is in the process of being deployed in a backward-compatible way.By orphaning non-signaling blocks during the BIP9 bit 1 "segwit" deployment, this BIP can cause the existing "segwit" deployment to activate without needing to release a new deployment. The proposal text includes an abstract, definitions, motivation, specification, backwards compatibility, rationale, and references. The proposal is a draft, and its author is James Hilliard.
