    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a discussion took place about the failure probabilities being high, particularly if an active attacker targets nodes carrying less commonly available blocks. A proposed solution was for nodes to use whatever mechanism an attacker uses to determine less commonly available blocks and choose to store a random percentage of them as well as their deterministic random set. The discussion then moved on to Sybil attacks and the need for proof of independent storage. While it was argued that proof of independent storage is essentially impossible, the bittorrent network was cited as an example where it can be achieved. Additionally, there was talk of a rewarding system that could motivate those with resources to run full nodes, increasing independence while eliminating the incentive for sybil attacking the network. The conversation ended with links to various GitHub pages related to Zcash and Bitcoin wallets, dynamic blocklists, and anti-spies and private torrents.</p>
