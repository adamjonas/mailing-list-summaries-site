    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the idea of paying people for running nodes on Bitcoin's network. While some argue that it could lead to a sybil attack, others suggest that once Lightning networks are in production, tips could be as granular as "per block downloaded" or "per rpc call," which would encourage more people to run full nodes and would increase the network's resistance to DDOS attacks. The consensus seems to be that sybil attacks are not a major concern as long as reasonable QOS metrics are stored per peer. However, there is a concern that paying people to run nodes could result in a cheaper way to run one node behind thousands of IPs, which could ultimately harm the network. Suggestions like this have been brought up many times before, and while paying for services is generally a good idea, it might be better served once Lightning networks are fully integrated.</p>
