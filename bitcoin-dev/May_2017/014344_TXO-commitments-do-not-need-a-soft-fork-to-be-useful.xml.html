    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev discussion thread, Alex Mizrahi pointed out that TXO commitments do not require consensus protocol changes to be useful. Peter Todd was called out for being slow to realize this, and it was noted that he previously discussed the idea of a distributed file system in 2013. However, it was suggested that his explanation may have been confusing and missed by some people due to its reference to a DHT. The importance of clear explanations and analogies was emphasized.</p>
