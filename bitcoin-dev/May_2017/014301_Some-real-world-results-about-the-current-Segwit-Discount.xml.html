    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a debate about the best approach for solving the SegWit block size discount issue. Sergio Demian Lerner has suggested throwing out the SegWit goals, while others propose increasing the discount ratio. However, reducing the cost of input prevout itself to make average inputs less expensive than outputs would be a better solution, according to Matt Corallo. This approach would reduce the discount, achieve the SegWit goal, and lower the ratio between worst-case and average-case block size. The potential bloat of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) increases with the implementation of SegWit and a 2MB hard fork. Gregory Maxwell points out that optimizing raw size is not very relevant in the long run, but if this were the goal, then the limit should be pure size.</p>
