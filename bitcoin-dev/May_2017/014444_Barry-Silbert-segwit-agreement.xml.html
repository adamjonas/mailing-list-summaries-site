    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom Zander via bitcoin-dev suggested a solution to the main issue that has been causing problems with 0.13.1+ having many segwit related features active already. He recommended banning older clients when they misbehave and advising them to upgrade to a version where SegWit is less buggy. Partitioning off those clients is not desired, hence it can be solved by choosing one activation code path. However, this isn't possible until either BIP141 segwit is active or BIP141 segwit has expired. Tom Zander also suggested that replacing the bit1 activation code with a bit4 activation logic, which is based on 80% and has no end-date, would eliminate worries about bip9 bit1 only needing 55% hashpower to be triggered. BIP91 activation is superior to trying to fully redeploy, as it is simpler and can be done immediately with only miners needing to upgrade.</p>
