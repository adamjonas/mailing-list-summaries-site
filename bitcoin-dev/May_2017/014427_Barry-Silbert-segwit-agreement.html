    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this question is proposing a hypothetical scenario in which the Silbert/NYC Segwit2MB proposal's lock-in triggers BIP141 signaling, rather than directly activating segwit. This would potentially avoid incompatibility with existing BIP141 nodes and result in segwit being activated sooner. The proposed method involves using Bit 4 (or bit 5) to signal support for "segwit now, HF (TBD) at scheduled date (Nov 23?)." If bit 4 support reaches 80%, two things would be locked in: the scheduled HF (conditional on segwit), and immediately turning on bit 1 (BIP141 support). However, the author acknowledges that this approach still leaves problems such as an aggressive HF schedule and possible chain split between Segwit2MB nodes and remaining BIP141 nodes. The focus of the proposal is how incompatibility with existing nodes could be minimized. If BIP141 support falls short of 95%, BIP91 could also be used. If Segwit2MB support reaches 80%, it seems likely that an additional 15% will support BIP141-without-HF.</p>
