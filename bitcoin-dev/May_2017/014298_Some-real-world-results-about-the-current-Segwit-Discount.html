    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It seems that there was a discussion about the maximum block weight for Bitcoin transactions. The suggestion was made that with a maximum block weight of 2.7M, each byte of non-witness block would cost 1.7. However, it was pointed out that these numbers do not work out and setting the discount to 1.7 would only allow for a maximum block size of 1.7MB in a soft fork, not 2.7MB. The person who made the initial suggestion had been thinking about what a hard fork could do to optimize the balance but realized that they were in the context of a soft fork.</p>
