    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation revolves around drivechains and the potential risks associated with it. The initial statement claims that the incentive to upgrade is only for preventing theft, not affecting miners' revenues. However, Peter Todd argues that miners have an interest in preventing theft and may induce it to give political cover to pushing a rival miner off the network. Both parties agree that miners can abstain from voting, which is politically neutral, or delegate their vote to an aggressive miner. The conversation highlights the security model of sidechains, user-activated soft forks, and the involvement of miners in the ecosystem. Paul Sztorc provides a project list and states that the entire altcoin market makes the case for the usefulness of sidechains. Lastly, the conversation ends with a request by Peter Todd for the Github link for the most up-to-date client-side validation work.</p>
