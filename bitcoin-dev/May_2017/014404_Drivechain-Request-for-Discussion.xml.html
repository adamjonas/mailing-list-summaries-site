    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion begins with a concern about the possibility of an unlikely chance where h* to be put in the coinbase turns out to be 0, resulting in the rejection of OP_NOP4 by old nodes. The purpose of OP_BRIBE is then explained, which is to allow users on the sidechain and mainchain to work together by providing some guarantee that Sam's sidechain block will make it into the largest chain. The question of whether OP_RETURN or OP_BRIBE is superior is then discussed, with the conclusion being that while an OP_RETURN provides some guarantee that it will make it into the longest mainchain, OP_BRIBE ensures that Sam's block goes onto the longer sidechain.The slow withdrawal process for side-to-main transfers is outlined and the security benefits of this are discussed. In extraordinary DAO-like situations, disinterested mainchain miners only need a single bit of information, "distress=true", to temporarily stop ACKing withdrawals from the sidechain, giving the reorg an unlimited amount of time to work itself out. Blind merged mining is briefly discussed and dismissed as inferior due to the possibility of a rich attacker reorging the sidechain outright without playing such games. Drivechain requires a soft fork to add each new sidechain, with the purpose being to keep track of what it should expect and prevent miners from stealing from the sidechain. Finally, the moot point of reducing the size of datacenters by removing surge suppressors and UPS's is addressed.</p>
