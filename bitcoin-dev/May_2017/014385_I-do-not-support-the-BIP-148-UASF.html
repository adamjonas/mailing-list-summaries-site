    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The core developers of Bitcoin are currently debating whether or not to allow an optional configuration switch which would signal and enforce BIP148. This switch would default off, but some developers are arguing that it should be allowed to be set by users. However, there is opposition to this proposal, as many believe that it would be arbitrary and needlessly disruptive. The goal of Bitcoin is to reach consensus on the state of a shared ledger, and splitting the network could be detrimental to this goal. Suhas Daftuar does not support the BIP 148 UASF Soft Fork because it introduces a new consensus rule that softforks out non-segwit signalling blocks in some time period. While he thinks that Bitcoin should adopt segwit, he believes that this concern should not trump the goal of not splitting the network. He argues that the deployment parameters for segwit are consensus-critical and that assuming that some other deployment has consensus is an unjustified leap. He believes that we have less disruptive methods available to us to activate segwit, even if the current BIP 9 deployment fails, such as another BIP 9 deployment in the future, or perhaps a BIP 149 deployment.Daftuar opposes BIP 148 because it is ill-conceived even for achieving its own presumed goals. It risks forking from older clients in the short term and forcing the activation of existing (non-UASF segwit) nodes almost guarantees at least a minor disruption. Besides, forced orphaning of 148 is seen as punitive for misbehaving miners, and this perspective is disagreed with. He recommends that we use the least disruptive mechanisms available, and the BIP148 proposal does not meet that test. Daftuar believes that users should not be at the mercy of any one part of the ecosystem. Ultimately, the rules of Bitcoin work because they're enforced by the users collectively. Daftuar thinks that there are other UASF proposals that avoid the forced disruption and would be slower to deploy, but he does not think that it is a flaw. Daftuar believes that we should have patience because Bitcoin is a system that should last for all ages and power mankind for a long time.</p>
