    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Cameron Garnham highlighted that significant deviations from the Bitcoin Security Model have been acknowledged as security vulnerabilities. The model assumes that every input into the Proof-of-Work function should have the same difficulty of producing a desired output. However, this is not entirely clear as long as effort to find a block is proportional to the block difficulty parameter. A quantum computer could find a block with effort proportional to the square root of the difficulty parameter, which would count as an attack. ASICBOOST was also criticised for doing multiple checks in parallel, which violates the independence of each hash when performing work.</p>
