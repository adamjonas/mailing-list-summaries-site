        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been suggested by Tomas van der Wansem that allows users to configure their own maximum block weight at a support threshold. The proposal aims to prevent off-chain debates by providing users with the freedom to choose their parameters while still maintaining full coordination of any changes, without the need for off-chain bickering. The proposal suggests using UTXO bits to coordinate size changes, allowing for larger and smaller blocks to be allowed. The proposal also notes that there is no need for miners to be involved in a decision to change this aspect of the protocol, as there are plenty of other ways to coordinate. On May 23, 2017, Tomas via bitcoin-dev proposed a mechanism that would allow users to configure the maximum block weight at a support threshold. This proposal does not give more power to miners or reduce decentralization as miners still rely on their blocks being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins. The BIP can be found on Github.Erik Aronesty suggested using UTXO bits instead of block thresholds to coordinate size changes; he only proposes an optional way to synchronize changes without the need for off-chain agreements which seems like a simple improvement over the current situation. Miners cannot change the block size or any other rule without the support of the users because their blocks and coins would be rejected. Someone can make it seem to a miner like 99% of nodes are ready for a larger weight even though that's false. Erik agrees that the user agent signaling isn't very important, and most of us aware that we cannot rely on counting them.It is worth noting that this proposal does not give more power to miners nor reduce decentralization. Miners still rely on their blocks being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins, and this proposal doesn't change that. Overall, the proposal provides users with greater control over the configuration of the maximum block weight, while maintaining coordination and decentralization. The BIP can be found on GitHub under BIP-changing-the-maximum-block weight-based-on-a-support-threshold.mediawiki.</p>
