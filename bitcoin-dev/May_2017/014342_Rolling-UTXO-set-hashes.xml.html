    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list took place regarding the advantages of a commitment to UTXO data. A commitment would allow lite nodes to download a UTXO set from any full node and verify it by verifying only block headers starting from genesis which is deemed as an old advantage with respect to the topic. However, for most of the arguments, compact membership proofs are required. Recently, there has been a rise in interest in full block lite clients for privacy reasons which complements membership proofless usage. Pieter described some uses for doing something like this without a commitment while Gregory Maxwell suggested gaining experience with operation without committing to it prior to making a consensus change. It was clarified that none of the previous (U)TXO commitment schemes require miners to participate in generating a commitment. Peter Todd published an argument earlier this year stating that UTXO commitments did not require a soft-fork to deploy.</p>
