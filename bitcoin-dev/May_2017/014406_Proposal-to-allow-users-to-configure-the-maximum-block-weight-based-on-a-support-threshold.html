    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made that allows users to configure their own maximum block weight at a support threshold. This mechanism would allow users to freely choose their parameters while still maintaining full coordination of any changes, without the need for off-chain bickering. The proposal suggests using UTXO bits to coordinate size changes, allowing for larger and smaller blocks to be allowed. The proposal also notes that there is no need for miners to be involved in a decision to change this aspect of the protocol, as there are plenty of other ways to coordinate. Without this mechanism, someone could make it seem to a miner like 99% of nodes are ready for a larger weight, even though that may not be true. The proposal can be found on Github under BIP-changing-the-maximum-block weight-based-on-a-support-threshold.mediawiki. It is worth noting that this proposal does not give more power to miners nor reduce decentralization.</p>
