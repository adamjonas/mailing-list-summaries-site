    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the discussion is about the usefulness of defining a deterministically chosen set of historical blocks within a certain timeframe and whether it would be better to leave it undefined. The proposal of using 49 days was made to allow SPV peers to catch up with a peer pruned to a datadir of approximately 10GB even if they were offline for a month. However, this may no longer be true after segwit activates. The BIP also suggests that peers should connect a limited amount of their available outbound connections to peers signaling one or both of the NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_* service bits if they expect to request less blocks than the signaled number. It is not clear whether this refers to peers downloading blocks or serving them. Additionally, there is a concern that light clients who are not checking the nServiceFlags from a relayed addr-message may unwillingly connect to a pruned peer and ask for (filtered) blocks at a depth below their pruned depth. This could potentially be a problem already.</p>
