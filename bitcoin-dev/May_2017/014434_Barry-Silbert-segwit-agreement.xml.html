    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion regarding the feasibility of scheduling a hard fork (HF) in Bitcoin development was held on May 26, 2017. James Hilliard via bitcoin-dev suggests that it would not be practical to schedule any HF until BIP141 is fully active. Hilliard believes that a proposed HF will require several months of development and testing before implementation, which makes BIP141's full activation necessary for a safe path forward. However, Tom Zander argues that this should not be an issue since BIP141 has been in development and testing for two years. Zander shares his thoughts through his blog and vlog channels.</p>
