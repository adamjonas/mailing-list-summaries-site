        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A work-in-progress extension block proposal by Christopher Jeffrey, Joseph Poon, Fedor Indutny, and Steven Pair has been reviewed, even though it hasn't been formally posted on the ML yet. The proposal involves locking exiting outputs for a certain period of time to prevent invalidation during reorgs. There are concerns about direct exit payments to legacy addresses, leading to the suggestion of adding a maturity requirement for exiting outputs or moving all exiting outputs to the coinbase. Several proposals have been made for improving the security and functionality of the Bitcoin network, including sequence-locking blocks to prevent DoS attacks from delaying punishment of dishonest parties within smart contracts.Another proposal is Pre-Allocated Smart-Contract Dispute Area (PASDA), which allows transactions that commence smart contracts to pre-allocate a section of the block that will always be reserved for dispute transactions. This guarantees space in blocks to handle disputes in case the contract breaks down. PASDA purports to address one half of the systematic risks in LN by possibly eliminating the DoS vector attack against LN. However, the costs of PASDA are very high, and possibly prohibitively so.The xblock proposal includes a sub-proposal for Lightning Network (LN) safety enhancement, called Pre-Allocated Smart-contract Dispute arena (PASDA). The proposal involves decreasing the block size for each open channel within the network to allow honest parties guaranteed space in the blocks to punish dishonest channel counter parties. However, there are concerns regarding the lack of clarity and specificity in the proposed BIPs and the potential negative effects of deactivating unused chains. The extension block proposal allows for increased transaction throughput without compromising the security of the main blockchain. However, it's more of a hard-fork than a soft-fork and requires a few minor additional rules. A sub-proposal in the xblock proposal suggests decreasing the block size for each open channel within the Lightning Network to allow honest parties guaranteed space in the blocks to punish dishonest channel counter parties. Christopher Jeffrey clarified that his proposal was not meant to be a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and acknowledged that many points need to be addressed in the spec. He emphasizes feedback, discusses several issues raised in the review, and proposes a solution for handling the migration of funds elsewhere once the extension block is deactivated. The proposed Payment Channel Arbitration Service Deployed in Advance (PASDA) aims to eliminate the denial-of-service (DoS) attack against Lightning Network (LN), although its high costs could be prohibitive.The proposal involves locking up exiting outputs for a certain period of time to prevent invalidation during reorgs, with two possible solutions suggested. There are concerns over direct exit payments to legacy addresses, leading to the suggestion of adding a maturity requirement for exiting outputs or moving all exiting outputs to the coinbase. Christopher Jeffrey has suggested revising the extension block specification/code to coexist with mainchain segwit and requiring exiting outputs to only be witness programs, which he believes could mitigate the issue assuming most segwit-supporting wallets would implement this rule before the activation of segwit.The xblock proposal also adds a feature that reserves space in blocks to allow honest parties guaranteed space in the blocks to punish dishonest channel counter parties. However, there are concerns regarding the lack of clarity and specificity in the proposed BIPs and the potential negative effects of deactivating unused chains. Other discussions include concerns over potential abuses of the system by miners or users trying to claim all unused space, and the maturity rule required for outputs. There are also proposals for atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Xbitcoin, but there are concerns over the maturity rule which would require outputs to only be witness programs.In conclusion, the proposal is seen as an academic topic rather than something ready for production use. The author suggests further analysis of the sub-proposal in detail and discusses its construction as well as its implications on smart-contracts like payment channels on top of Bitcoin. PASDA purports to address one half of the systematic risks in LN by possibly eliminating the DoS vector attack against LN. However, the costs of PASDA are very high, and possibly prohibitively so. The email thread discusses various technical details related to the proposed extension block feature in Bitcoin.</p>
