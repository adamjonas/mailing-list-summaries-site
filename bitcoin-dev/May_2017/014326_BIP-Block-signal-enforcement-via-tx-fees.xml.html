    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new BIP draft for OP_CHECKBLOCKVERSION has been proposed by Luke Dashjr, with the aim of providing an alternative to BIP 8 in the long term and allowing the community to put economic pressure on miners to deploy softforks without the extreme of a UASF. The proposal involves using a script system for construction, but some have suggested it would be better to use the transaction version number instead by soft-forking in a rule. This rule requires that if we have block version blkVersion and transaction version txVersion, when the most significant bits of a transaction version are 001, the transaction can only be included in blocks whose lower 29 version bits are set at the same position as the lower 29 version bits set in the transaction version. However, some feel this is still a bad proposal, because it may encourage miners to false signal readiness, which undermines both BIP 9 and BIP 8. An implementation is available based on top of BIP 115's implementation.</p>
