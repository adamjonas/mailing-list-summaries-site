    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, Paul Sztorc introduced the concept of "Blind Merged Mining" (BMM) which he developed to allow SHA256^2 miners to merge-mine "drivechains", even if they are not running the actual sidechain software. The aim is to prevent sidechains from affecting the levelness of the mining playing field. Although not required for drivechain, BMM would address some of the last remaining concerns. However, Peter Todd responded that the security properties of BMM are much weaker than what he had proposed in ZooKeyv. Todd suggested that if miners never validate sidechains, whoever bids the most for the chain can spam a 3-month long stream of invalid headers and then withdraw all of the coins deposited to the sidechain. Additionally, since the mining is blind, miners who remain blind forever have no way of telling who should really get the funds. Todd further questioned about the incentive for miners to upgrade to full node as it is an expensive and time-consuming operation.</p>
