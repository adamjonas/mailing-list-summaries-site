    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Compatibility-oriented Omnibus Proposal is a proposal that seeks to fulfill the commitments made in the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement, which include activating Segregated Witness (SegWit) at an 80% threshold and activating a 2 MB hard fork within six months. The proposal aims to minimize risks of a destructive chain split while retaining maximum compatibility with existing deployment approaches. It incorporates multiple constituent proposals, including James Hilliard’s “Reduced signalling threshold activation of existing segwit deployment”, Shaolin Fry’s “Mandatory activation of segwit deployment”, Sergio Demian Lerner’s “Segwit2Mb” proposal, Luke Dashjr’s “Post-segwit 2 MB block size hardfork”, and hard fork safety mechanisms from Johnson Lau’s “Spoonnet”. The proposal includes both fast-activation and flag-day activation options to prevent unnecessary delays in the network upgrade process and provide an opportunity for cooperation and unity instead. It also links SegWit’s activation with that of a later hard fork block size increase to avoid a cryptocurrency split. Additionally, it imposes a legacy witness discount and a 2MB blocksize limit along with the enactment of Spoonnet-derived protectionary measures to ensure the safest possible fork activation within the constraints of the requirements outlined in the Scaling Agreement. Although not likely to be merged into Bitcoin Core in the immediate future because it includes the activation of a hard fork for which community consensus does not yet exist, this proposal is written with the intent to remain cleanly compatible with future network updates and changes, allowing for the option of a straightforward upstream merge if community consensus for the proposal is successfully achieved in the following months.</p>
