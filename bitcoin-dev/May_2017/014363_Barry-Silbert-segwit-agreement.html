    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is regarding the activation of SegWit, with particular focus on Barry Silbert's proposal. The writer expresses doubts about the technical aspects of the proposal and suggests that helping Johnson's spoonnet/forcenet proposals in a hardfork would be more sensible. The writer thinks that just doing a simple 2MB without addressing other issues would be uninteresting and a hardfork without replay protection would not be professional. Furthermore, the writer believes that proposing a hardfork in four months is insane as it would be impossible for all nodes to upgrade in such a short time.The writer suggests that activating BIP141 ASAP and then hardforking to 2MB in September 2018 or 2019, together with forcenet/spoonnet, would be a better option. Alternatively, BIP148 is gaining momentum again, making it a more interesting option. The email also discusses the Barry Silbert agreement, which aims to activate SegWit immediately but under a different deployment that is incompatible with the current BIP141 deployment. The writer thinks that the proposal is not immediate activation since it requires a lower threshold and is not compatible with the current deployment. The writer suggests several options to activate SegWit, including for 95% of hashrate to signal, deploying BIP148 UASF, redeploying SegWit on a new bit, or using BIP149. The writer also proposes a fourth option suggested by James Hilliard, which involves making BIP148 miner triggered (MASF) with a lower threshold above 50%. The writer believes this would increase the chances of activation quickly, assuming a majority of miners want to go this route. However, the activation would still be in the hands of miners, leaving room for failure. The writer concludes that the Barry Silbert agreement is ill-considered and lacking peer review from the technical community. The writer believes that closed-door agreements between selected participants are not the way to garner consensus to change a $30bn decentralized system. The writer's purpose is to assist in the immediate activation of SegWit, which only requires hashrate to participate, and provide technical input. Finally, the writer suggests being open to all reasonable options to move things forward in a safe and collaborative way.</p>
