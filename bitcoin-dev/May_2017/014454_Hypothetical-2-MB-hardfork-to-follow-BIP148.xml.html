    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a real 2MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation was outlined in a post by Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev. The proposal is not part of any agreement and he does not recommend it be adopted, but suggests that if the community wishes to adopt a 2MB block size hardfork, this is probably the best way to do it right now. Dashjr left the Author blank as he does not intend to personally champion this, and before it may be assigned a BIP number, someone else will need to take on that role. The proposal includes a block size limit of 2000000 bytes being enforced upon activation, while the block weight limit remains at 4000000 WU. All witness data, including both scriptSig (used by pre-segwit inputs) and segwit witness data, is measured as 1 weight-unit (WU), while all other data in the block is measured as 4 WU. The witness commitment in the generation transaction is no longer required. Instead, the txid merkle root in the block header is replaced with a hash of the witness reserved value, the witness merkle root hash, and the transaction ID merkle root hash. The maximum size of a transaction stripped of witness data is limited to 1 MB. This proposal is deployed by flag day, in the block where the median-past time surpasses 1543503872 (2018 Nov 29 at 15:04:32 UTC).</p>
