        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of a message provided feedback on the bip8 extension to bip9, suggesting that it could be improved. The author highlighted that with bip9, a bip9-ready node would receive a warning if it saw a softfork activated that it was not aware of. However, nodes implementing bip8 but not a certain deployment that is activated at the end of the period cannot receive such a warning. The author proposed reserving one of the nVersion for requiring that the bit is active for one block when a deployment is locked in this way, which they believe would require simple code changes. They offered to help with implementation. A thread on the topic was avoided as being too broad. Links to the implementation and the GitHub repository were also provided.</p>
