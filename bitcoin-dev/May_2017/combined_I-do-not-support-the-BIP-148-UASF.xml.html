        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell has expressed his opposition to the User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) proposed in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP 148). While he supports the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit), he believes that the approach proposed in BIP 148 is not up to the engineering standards of the community. Maxwell suggests that UASF should not disrupt mining and advocates for the use of the least disruptive mechanisms available, pointing out that there are other UASF proposals that are superior to BIP 148.The email thread in question discusses the activation of SegWit and the best way to implement it. Several participants agree that using a Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF) anytime from now until April 2018 through Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 8 (BIP8) is a better alternative to BIP 148. There are also discussions about the role of "core" in the development of Bitcoin and the distinction between work done inside and outside of the core group.However, the Bitcoin development community is divided over the proposed UASF to initiate Segregated Witness. James Hilliard has argued that miners will not mine incompatible blocks, while Tom Zander has warned against relying on one implementation to avoid chain forks. Meanwhile, Cameron Garnham claims that the Bitcoin Community wants a resolution swiftly and that BIP 148 may bring about “a minor level of disruption”. Steven Pine questions whether it is time for Core to move on from SegWit.Maxwell's concerns regarding BIP 148 include the forced orphaning of non-signalling blocks, which he deems unnecessary, and the limitations of its design that could lead to the rejection of passive participants' blocks. Despite this, he does not oppose the general concept of a UASF but believes that it should not risk disruption of mining.</p>
