    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email chain, the discussion is around the 1 MB block size rule and the 4 MB weight rule, specifically in relation to segwit. The author argues that violating the 1 MB block size rule also violates the 4 MB weight rule. They refer to specific checks in the code to support their argument, and suggest that after segwit activation, the 1 MB size limit check could be removed and the weight limit increased without changing the discount or having two limits.Mark Friedenbach jumps into the conversation to clarify that the 1 MB classic block size is not redundant after segwit activation because it prevents quadratic hashing problems from being worse than they are today. This statement is in response to Jorge Timón's suggestion to remove the 1 MB size limit check.Luke Dashjr then shares a BIP for a real 2 MB block size hardfork following Segwit BIP148 activation, but he cannot recommend it since 1 MB blocks are still too large and this blunt-style hardfork is quite risky even with consensus. The BIP suggests that upon activation, a block size limit of 2000000 bytes will be enforced, while the block weight limit remains at 4000000 WU. The witness commitment in the generation transaction is no longer required, and instead, the txid merkle root in the block header is replaced with a hash of the witness reserved value, the witness merkle root hash, and the transaction ID merkle root hash. The maximum size of a transaction stripped of witness data is limited to 1 MB. The deployment is scheduled for 18 months from the creation date of the BIP, intended to give six months to establish consensus and 12 months for deployment.</p>
