    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, James MacWhyte suggested that adding a transaction-size limit of 10kb would solve the quadratic hashing problem. According to him, the current 1MB block size limit prevents the problem from getting any worse than it already is. However, by adding a transaction size limit, the problem would become a non-issue. In response to his suggestion, a question was raised regarding the need for this limit, especially since there is already code in place in the validation.cpp file that seems to address the issue.</p>
