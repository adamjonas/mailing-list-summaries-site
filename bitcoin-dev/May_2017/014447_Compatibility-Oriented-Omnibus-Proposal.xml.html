    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests combining James Hilliard’s “Reduced signalling threshold activation of existing segwit deployment,” Shaolin Fry’s “Mandatory activation of segwit deployment,” Sergio Demian Lerner’s “Segwit2Mb” proposal, Luke Dashjr’s “Post-segwit 2 MB block size hardfork,” and hard fork safety mechanisms from Johnson Lau’s “Spoonnet” into a single omnibus proposal and patch set. The proposal aims to activate Segregated Witness (SegWit) at an 80% threshold signaling at bit 4 while activating a 2MB hard fork within six months as committed in the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement. The proposed hard fork incorporates a legacy witness discount and a 2MB block size limit along with the enactment of Spoonnet-derived protectionary measures to ensure the safest possible fork activation. The proposal is written under the assumption that the signatories to the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement are genuinely committed to the terms of the agreement and intend to enact the updates described therein. This proposal is unlikely to be merged into Bitcoin Core in the immediate future but is written with the intent to remain cleanly compatible with future network updates and changes to allow for the option of a straightforward upstream merge if community consensus for the proposal is successfully achieved in the following months.The proposal includes various activation options such as fast-activation and flag-day activation to prevent unnecessary delays in the network upgrade process, addressing a common criticism of the Scaling Agreement and providing an opportunity for cooperation and unity. To minimize the chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backwards compatibility, miners should upgrade their nodes to support segsignal as well as BIP148. The proposal defines a "hardfork signaling block," which is a block with the sign bit of header nVersion is set. Child of a hardfork signaling block MUST also be a hardfork signaling block. Hardfork network version bit is 0x02000000, and a tx is invalid if the highest nVersion byte is not zero, and the network version bit is not set. The deployment of the “fast-activation” soft fork is identical to Hilliard’s segsignal proposal, and the deployment of the “flag-day” soft fork is identical to Fry’s BIP148 proposal. The proposal maintains full legacy consensus compatibility for users up until the HardForkHeight block height, after which backward compatibility is waived as enforcement of the hard fork consensus ruleset begins. This document is placed in the public domain.</p>
