    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>William Casarin, from the OTS development team, has created a new OTS format called miniOTS, which is a compressed version of the standard format that allows attestations to fit in a tweet. The goal was to have small enough proofs so that the stamp of the previous message can be replied to a tweet instead of relying on external sites such as @otsproofbot. The current format is 210 bytes and 288 bytes base58-encoded. Just stripping out additional attestations in the standard format only gets it down to just above 280 bytes when base58 encoded, which is too much for a tweet, so the creator decided to roll out a custom format that is a bit more efficient with attestation and op tags. There is no OTS decoder yet available for this format and more information can be obtained by visiting the provided links.</p>
