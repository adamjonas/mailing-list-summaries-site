    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the meaning and utility of an "unforgeable register" in relation to encumbered coins. The owner of outputs that represent value in Bitcoin is recorded publicly and cannot be faked, but it's not clear why a record of outputs that cannot be traded for something else would be valuable. Tamas Blummer argues that there is a deeper utility of Bitcoin than just its ability to be traded for something else; it's the unforgeable register. By having covenants, other kinds of units can be created that are not fungible with common ones. Even though encumbered units are less desirable, they still offer the utility of using the unforgeable register of debt covered by reserves. Eric Voskuil argues that for something to become property and have marketable value, it should be both scarce and useful. Bitcoin is useful only to the extent that it can be traded for something else that is useful. He thinks that Tamas Blummer is only dealing with scarcity and ignoring utility. Tamas Blummer counters that units needed to maintain an unforgeable register of debt covered by reserves could still be valuable to some extent, even if encumbered with a debt covenant. Eric Voskuil believes that temporary control does not have value until means dealing with it are offered. He adds that final control might obtain value if it's deemed too expensive or not attainable. Tamas Blummer clarifies that he meant control of entries in the register which he thinks is the deeper utility of Bitcoin. Final control is meant to be the opposite of temporary control with some expiry.</p>
