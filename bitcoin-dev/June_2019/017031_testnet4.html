    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there was a discussion about whether or not to reset the testnet. One member questioned why it shouldn't be resetted just because there is a better alternative for it. However, it was pointed out that the size of testnet itself is an important test and some argue that it should even be larger than mainnet. While some developers may do all their testing on internal regtest nodes or directly on mainnet, this approach may not be applicable to everyone. Peter Todd, who signed off on the email, provided a link to his website where he shares his personal thoughts on various topics related to Bitcoin. Attached to the email was a signature file with his contact information.</p>
