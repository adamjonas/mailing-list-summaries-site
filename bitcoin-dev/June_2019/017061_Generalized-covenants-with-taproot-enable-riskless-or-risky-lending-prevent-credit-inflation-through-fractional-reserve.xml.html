    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the formalization of loans in finance and how it could be implemented in Bitcoin. The author addresses some possible issues inline, stating that interest cannot be guaranteed, which means that a return of principle minus economic interest on that principle (ie opportunity cost) is guaranteed, and risk remains, as both volatility and opportunity cost remain as risks. The email proposes a covenant system to enable lending with full reserve check in Bitcoin. Alice receives a loan from Bob and sends it to outputs that inherit a taproot path of validation with placeholder _  and time(100),pk(C), where C is Bobâ€™s key and 100 is maturity. Charlie can pass on the coins to another temporary owner until maturity when Bob re-collects them unconditionally. If Charlie accepts an or(b, pk(Charlie) covenant transitive) output, he trusts that Alice will offer a regular payment in exchange for it before maturity since that output is worthless to Charlie after maturity as Bob can just take it. This implies that each encumbered coin is not fungible with any other of a distinct discount schedule. Alice cannot issue promissory notes in excess of own capital or capital that she was able to borrow. Due to the transitive covenant, Charlie could turn to Dan and do a re-purchase (repo) agreement with him if he needs final coins immediately. Dan would charge high interest through a discount since he has to bear the credit risk of Charlie. We need to define further transaction level validations for transactions spending inputs with covenants.In summary, the email proposes a covenant system to enable lending with full reserve check in Bitcoin. It also discusses the formalization of loans in finance and how it could be implemented in Bitcoin.</p>
