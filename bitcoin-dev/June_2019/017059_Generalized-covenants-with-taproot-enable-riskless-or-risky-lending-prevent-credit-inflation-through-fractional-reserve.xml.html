In finance, loans are formalized as zero bonds, which are contracts between two parties where one party receives an amount less than the principal amount and has to pay back the principal amount at a later time point called maturity. The difference between the amount received and the principal amount is the interest implied by the contract.For instance, if Alice receives 1 BTC in exchange for paying back 1.2 BTC after one year, the interest rate implied by the contract would be 20%.
