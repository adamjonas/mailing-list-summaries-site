    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Testnet blockchain is an important tool for developers to test new features and upgrades before they are implemented on the mainnet. However, due to the nature of testnet coins having no value, the blockchain could be spammed after a reset until it reaches a certain size. Peter Todd argues that the size of testnet itself is an important test, and has suggested in the past that testnet should be made larger than mainnet. He personally prefers to do his testing on internal regtest nodes or directly on mainnet, but acknowledges that this may not be applicable to everyone. Emil Engler suggests that there could be a better alternative to testnet, but also recognizes that it is still a useful tool and should not be ignored.</p>
