    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Tamas Blummer and Eric Voskuil discuss the value of encumbered coins with a debt covenant. Blummer argues that these coins represent temporary control of a scarce resource that can offer a way to generate income for hodlers by temporarily giving up control. He also suggests that such coins could have value if people find the register of covered debt useful, even if some may consider the concept of covered debt bogus. Blummer further explains that the deeper utility of Bitcoin is its unforgeable register, and that covenants would create other kinds of units that are not fungible with common ones. Voskuil counters that something needs to be both scarce and useful to become property and have marketable value, and questions the utility of a record of outputs that cannot be traded for something else. However, he acknowledges that temporary control implies the possibility of value and that rental of a consumable good does not apply to non-consumable goods. In conclusion, they agree to disagree on the value of encumbered coins and leave it at that.</p>
