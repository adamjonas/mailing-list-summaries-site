    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell, a developer of Bitcoin, has proposed a new "emergency RBF" rule that allows for a transaction to be replaced with a higher fee transaction if it is not confirmed in a timely manner. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for this rule to be used for spamming. Specifically, a user named Alice could alternate RBFing two transactions, each one placing itself at the bottom of Bob's top 4,000,000 weight mempool which pushes the other one below the top 4,000,000 weight, and then repeating with the other transaction. This could potentially cause issues for nodes receiving these transactions. While the proposal does not open up significant new ability for RBF spamming, Rusty has suggested that there may be ways to mitigate this issue.</p>
