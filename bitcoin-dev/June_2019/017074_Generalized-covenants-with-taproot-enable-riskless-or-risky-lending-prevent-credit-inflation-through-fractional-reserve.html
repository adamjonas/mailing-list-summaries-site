    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Tamas Blummer and Eric Voskuil revolves around the value of Bitcoin. Blummer suggests that temporary control of bitcoin, which represents a scarce resource, can obtain value depending on the availability of final control and the ability to deal with temporary control. However, Voskuil argues that for something to be considered property and have marketable value, it must be both scarce and useful. He points out that Bitcoin is not consumable and its usefulness lies in its ability to be traded for something else that is useful. The discussion also touches upon the idea of final control versus temporary control, with Voskuil stating that Bitcoin's usefulness comes from the presumption that there is no finality of control. Blummer disagrees with Voskuil's assertion that temporary control cannot have value and is working on developing technical means to represent it. However, Voskuil maintains that if Bitcoin cannot be traded or consumed, it cannot obtain marketable value.</p>
