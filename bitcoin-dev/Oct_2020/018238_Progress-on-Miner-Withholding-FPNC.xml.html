    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the proposed floating-point Nakamoto consensus (FPNC) and its potential impact on the network. The current problem with the network is the miner withholding attack, which provides an incentive for miners to hold onto blocks to gain an unfair advantage. This leads to a more centralized network and encourages disagreements. The solution to this attack was presented in a paper many years ago and is currently used in the network. However, implementing FPNC removes this solution and risks reintroducing the selfish mining attack. Therefore, FPNC is considered a hard NAK.</p>
