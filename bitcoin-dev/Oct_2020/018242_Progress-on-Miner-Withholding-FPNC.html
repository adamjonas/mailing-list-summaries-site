    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mike Brooks has replied to Pieter Wuille's message regarding the FPNC idea. Mike agrees with Pieter that the code provided privately to the security team will consume 99% of the CPU, which does have an effect on the electorate. He argues that the `getdata` message is a problem that would concern operators, and perhaps the threshold for a patch is much too high. The layered security system like what is found in bitcoin necessitates an attack chain. As ZmnSCPxj pointed out, block mixing will give preemption at most 67% of the network, and the remaining dissenting nodes can be quelled by maxing out their processing power. All of this can be used together to make sure that a withheld block becomes the prevailing solution. Furthermore, Mike believes that FPNC rebalances incentives to serve the interests of the network, and fundamentally resolves a class of abuses that reshape the electorate. FPNC will produce a more decentralized and fair network than "first seen." Mike acknowledges that the idea for FPNC came out of a conversation with ZmnSCPxj's in regards to re-org stability. After touching base with ZmnSCPxj and Greg Maxwell, there is an overwhelming view that the current problems that face the network outweigh any theoretical ones.Pieter Wuille responded to Mike Brooks' message stating that Greg Maxwell isn't on this list, but assuming this is about the conversion you've had on Bitcoin Core's security disclosure list, Pieter believes this is a misrepresentation. The discussion has been mostly around a DoS attack report which turned out to be a mistake.</p>
