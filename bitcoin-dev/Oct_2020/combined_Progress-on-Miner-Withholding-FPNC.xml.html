        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the issues of block-withholding attacks and FPNC and proposes two simple changes that could significantly improve the network. The current issue with the network is the miner withholding attack, which creates an unintended incentive to hold onto blocks. Major mining pools are actively using this strategy, creating an unfair advantage, home-field advantage, and contributing to centralized networks. Withholding delays transactions and encourages disagreements, making it ideal for dishonest miners.The idea for FPNC came from a conversation with ZmnSCPxj regarding re-org stability. After discussing with ZmnSCPxj and Greg Maxwell, it was agreed that the current problems facing the network outweigh any theoretical ones. However, Pieter Wuille chimed in to clarify that the discussion was mostly centered around a DoS attack report that turned out to be a mistake.Mike Brooks has replied to Pieter Wuille's message regarding the FPNC idea. Mike believes that FPNC rebalances incentives to serve the interests of the network and fundamentally resolves a class of abuses that reshape the electorate. FPNC will produce a more decentralized and fair network than "first seen." Despite the risks, proponents argue that the proposed changes will ultimately benefit the network and users.The proposed solution involves rebalancing the selfish-mining incentives with faster block creation times and floating-point Nakamoto Consensus (FPNC). Currently, miners have an incentive to hold onto blocks in order to gain an advantage in calculating the next block, leading to a centralized network and delays in transactions. However, implementing FPNC removes this solution and risks reintroducing the selfish mining attack, and therefore is considered a hard NAK.Pieter Wuille responded to Mike Brooks' message stating that Greg Maxwell isn't on this list, but assuming this is about the conversion you've had on Bitcoin Core's security disclosure list, Pieter believes this is a misrepresentation. Mike believes that the `getdata` message is a problem that would concern operators and perhaps the threshold for a patch is much too high.</p>
