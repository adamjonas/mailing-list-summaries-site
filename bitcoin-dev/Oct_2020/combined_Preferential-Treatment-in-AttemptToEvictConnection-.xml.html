        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community has raised concerns about the preferential treatment and unusual comments contained in AttemptToEvictConnection(), which is employed to limit the impact of eclipsing attacks. The worry is that an adversary aiming to offer data-arbitrage services will receive favored treatment in network formation. The code on line 948 affirms that an attacker cannot anticipate which netgroups will be protected, but they can possess more netgroups than node slots.Similarly, the code on line 952 states that an attacker cannot manipulate this metric without physically relocating nodes closer to the target. Still, they can run tcp-traceroute on the network to locate where miners are concentrated and execute a malicious message-relay in a nearby data center. Line 955 protects four nodes that recently sent novel transactions accepted into the mempool. However, a dishonest centralized-service may preemptively send novel-transactions as part of the handshake for new hosts, enhancing the likelihood of the connection staying open and severing ties with an honest node.Similarly, on line 962, the code safeguards four nodes that most recently transmitted novel blocks, but an attacker can manipulate this metric with the data-arbitrage of novel blocks. By moving newly created blocks from the source to all areas of the network, they can acquire value within the connection pool of new hosts. All of the above checks, except for the one beginning on line 948, are prone to a race condition. With ongoing centralization, equitable connection formation becomes a growing concern, placing substantial pressure on AttemptToEvictConnection().</p>
