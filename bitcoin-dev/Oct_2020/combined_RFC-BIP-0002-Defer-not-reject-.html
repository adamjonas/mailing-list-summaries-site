        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposed change to BIP-0002 has been made by アルム　カールヨハン, suggesting that the current 3-year-rule be modified. Currently, a BIP can only be changed to "Rejected" status after three years. However, アルム　カールヨハン proposes that the status should be changed to "Deferred" instead of "Rejected". The current rules for rejecting a BIP have ambiguous meanings, with both "soft" and "hard" rejections. The aim of this proposal is to disambiguate the second option into "deferred" status or add a new status called "Inactive".In addition to this proposal, there is an alternative suggestion that proposes updating the rejection criteria in BIP 2. The proposal recommends requiring an actual concern rather than just a lack of progress in three years for a BIP to be rejected. The details of these proposals can be found on the following link: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1016">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1016</a>. Readers are encouraged to consider either one or both of these proposals. The proposer of the minor change to BIP-0002 suggests allowing anyone to change the status of a BIP to "Deferred" instead of "Rejected". The current 3-year-rule already has ambiguous meaning with "hard" and "soft" rejects. The intention of this proposal is to clarify the second option by either classifying it as "deferred" or introducing a new status called "Inactive". It is important to note that the BIP editor will not unreasonably reject a BIP. There are several reasons for rejecting a BIP, including duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility, or not aligning with the Bitcoin philosophy. If a BIP has not made progress in three years, it may be changed from Draft or Proposed status to Rejected status upon request by any person. However, if the champion of the BIP provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism, it may be changed to Draft status. Alternatively, if the BIP meets the required criteria as described in the previous paragraph, it may be changed to Proposed status.</p>
