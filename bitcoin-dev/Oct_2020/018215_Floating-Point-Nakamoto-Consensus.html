    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about the growing disagreement in mining capacity and the need to avoid ambiguity in disagreement for complete consensus. ZmnSCPxj argues that the security fundamentals are what drive the necessity for a solution and highlights an exploit that was delivered to the Bitcoin-core security team. The exploit is not fixable by floating-point Nakamoto consensus and can be broken by a single manually-created connection between both sides of the chain-split. ZmnSCPxj emphasizes the need for more time beyond the industry standard of 90 days before disclosure and suggests that if the consensus is a rejection, then there shouldn't be any concerns with a sensible 90-day disclosure policy. Overall, ZmnSCPxj asserts their expertise in difficult vendors and argues that argument screens off authority.</p>
