        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin projects have been requested to create a file called 'bips.txt' which describes all the BIPs used in the project. The file can be uploaded to the root of the website used for the project and should follow a specified format. This initiative aims to help users, developers, journalists, researchers, and crawlers understand all BIPs used in different Bitcoin projects, their implementation, and importance. Although all BIPs with details are already mentioned on GitHub, not all developers or users may understand their importance and usage.To make it easier to understand the BIPs used in different Bitcoin projects, an attempt is being made to create a BIPs gallery which currently has basic images for each BIP. Later, it will include a page with video links, usage, issues, history, other helpful links, etc. A discussion regarding this was initiated on stackexchange, and the website where this work is being carried out is <a href="https://bips.gallery/">https://bips.gallery/</a>. The Github repository for it is <a href="https://github.com/prayank23/BIPsGallery">https://github.com/prayank23/BIPsGallery</a>.</p>
