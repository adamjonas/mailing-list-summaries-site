    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, ZmnSCPxj discusses the issue of inbound liquidity on the Lightning Network. He notes that companies can open a channel with each employee who has insufficient inbound liquidity in order to receive their salary. If an employee's node does not have the necessary capacity, the company can use offchain-to-onchain swaps to create a fresh channel to the new hire. The occasional bonus and permanent raises can be accommodated by increasing the size of the channel or using alternative methods to free up capacity. Even if an employee leaves the company, the channel need not be closed as the company can earn forwarding fees from their new employer or income source. While it is not a perfect solution, it is still better than the onchain situation.</p>
