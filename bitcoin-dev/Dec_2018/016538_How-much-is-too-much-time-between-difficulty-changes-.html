    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that the difficulty in solving a block should be allowed to linearly drop as the solvetime goes beyond a certain limit, which would be backwards-compatible if the limit is greater than any past delay. In the event that a faster DA is needed, a simple daily-rolling average DA like BCH is likely the best option.As a point of research interest, the idea of "intra-block" timestamp-based difficulty adjustment has been taken to the limit and made symmetrical and continuous. This results in a "tightening of the Poisson" that increases "availability" at an expense in "consistency." However, it requires a very tight future time limit to reduce timestamp manipulation. The objective of this was to help small coins deal with persistent hash rate changes that result in long delays. Currently, about three coins have tested this on their testnet. The above information was shared on Github, specifically in regards to difficulty algorithms. The author suggests a potential solution for persistent hash rate changes, which could benefit smaller coins struggling with long delays. Although the idea may not be necessary for Bitcoin, it is being researched and implemented on testnets for other coins.</p>
