    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to use a 64-byte signature for the default "signing all" sighash and a 65-byte signature for other sighash types. This change will save space, allowing more transactions to be included in a block. However, this will make witness weight estimation challenging in multisig cases. The idea of signing witness weight has been previously suggested; however, there are concerns about estimating the witness weight for complex scripts that require this feature most. This approach would work when not required, but it may not work when needed. Russell O'Connor, in a Bitcoin-dev post, suggested considering "signature covers witness weight." While this method does not eliminate all types of witness malleability, it does eliminate the worst type of witness malleability from the user's perspective. The new fixed-sized signature of the Schnorr BIP makes it easier to compute the final witness weight before signing. However, in complex multi-party signing protocols, the final witness weight may not be known at the time of signing for everyone involved. Therefore, the "signature covers witness weight" should be optional.</p>
