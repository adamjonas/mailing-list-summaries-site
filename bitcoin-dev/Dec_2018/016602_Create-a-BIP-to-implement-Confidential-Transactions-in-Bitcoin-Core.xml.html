    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Kenshiro requested the creation of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to implement Confidential Transactions (CT) in Bitcoin Core, citing their potential to provide privacy and fungibility for users. However, SomberNight responded explaining that the BIP process involves creating the proposal oneself rather than requesting it, and expressed doubts about the possibility of achieving consensus on CT implementation due to concerns around computational binding and the potential for undetectable inflation. SomberNight cited section 4.6 of the Bulletproofs paper as evidence, stating that an adversary who can break the binding property of the commitment scheme or soundness of the proof system could generate coins out of thin air and render the currency useless. Kenshiro had also suggested that if the CT transaction size is three times that of a normal transaction, then the block size could be increased by three times or alternatively keep the current block size and make CT transactions optional.</p>
