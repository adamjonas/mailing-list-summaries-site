    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Johnson Lau raised concerns about the complexity of a proposed script. If the script is not safer in practice, then the extra complexity serves no purpose. However, if it is safer, then it could help prevent people from losing funds. Another participant in the thread argued that every security measure can be considered overkill until someone loses money. The discussion then shifted to whether this was a security issue or a software reliability issue. It was ultimately determined that it is a trade-off between the complexity of the core protocol and wallet software. While a core protocol failure would impact all Bitcoin users, a wallet software failure would only affect a smaller number of people. Therefore, prioritizing core protocol simplicity is recommended.</p>
