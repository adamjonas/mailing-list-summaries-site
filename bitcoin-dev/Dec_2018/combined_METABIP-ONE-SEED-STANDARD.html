        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In order to ensure the safety of users' funds, it is desirable for a user to have only one seed necessary to recover a wallet, regardless of the software or hardware used. However, currently there exists confusion regarding this issue, with many users believing that BIP39 fulfills this requirement, despite it being marked "Unanimously discourage for implementation" in the Bitcoin wiki. To address this issue, the METABIP does not propose or advocate for a specific format but stresses the importance and urgency of a clear definition. Its purpose is to provide synthetic and transparent characteristics of each existing format. Advantages/disadvantages categorization was avoided. BIP39 is widely implemented/supported but has certain weaknesses such as a weak KDF, no version number, no birth date, requires a fixed word list, and is extendable with passphrases. Electrum seeds are only supported by Electrum and include a version number, do not require a fixed word list, and are also extendable with passphrases. AEZeeds are only supported by LND, include a version number and birth date, require a fixed word list, and encrypt seed with the passphrase that can be modified. Cypherseed includes all aspects of AEZeeds but uses 5char blocks instead of words and MAC tags for plausible deniability. AEZ is an authenticated-encryption (AE) scheme optimized for ease of correct use ("AE made EZ"). Despite its name suggesting anti-easiness, especially for hardware design, AEZ's aim is to make encryption easy for users. The overall goal of the METABIP is to arrive at a consensus on a sensible theme.</p>
