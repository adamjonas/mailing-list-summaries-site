    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the design considerations of a channel setup between two parties (A and B) using BIP118, 143, and 141-P2WSH without taproot. The setup involves creating a setup transaction with a setup output script that is not signed. This is followed by an update transaction and a settlement transaction, both with specific outputs that use relative-locktime. The process is repeated for subsequent updates until the channel is closed. The NOINPUT condition is used in the update transaction to allow for flexibility. The compatibility of this setup with Statechains is also discussed, as it mirrors the Eltoo setup. However, combining the trigger and setup transactions is not possible outside of Mimblewimble, and it's not clear how fungibility would be affected if taproot is added. Christian Decker clarifies that combining the trigger and setup transactions would result in all timeouts starting immediately, which defeats the purpose of having them in the first place.</p>
