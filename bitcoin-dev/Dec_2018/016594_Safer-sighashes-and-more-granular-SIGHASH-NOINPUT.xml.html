    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about proposed uses of CODESEPARATOR, a script was provided that involved two separate scripts. The first script (S1) contained the OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY and OP_CHECKSIG commands, while the second script (S2) contained the commands OP_CSV, OP_DROP, and OP_CHECKSIG. Under taproot, it is possible to make Q = P + H(P||S2)G, where P = MuSig(KeyA, KeyB), making S1 a direct spending with Q, eliminating the need for OP_IF or CODESEPARATOR in S2 altogether. There was also discussion of using CODESEPARATOR to force R reuse, but it was noted that this could be achieved with fewer bytes without its use. It was suggested that a much better way would be to use SWAP CAT CHECKSIG. Additionally, it was mentioned that the discrete log of R could be a shared secret between A and B, and if the purpose was to publish the private key to the whole world, R = G could be used.Finally, there was mention of a previous email on Lightning-dev about the use of CODESEPARATOR to impose Scriptless Script even without Schnorr. This involved three signatures with different CODESEPARATOR places and forced R reuse so that the signatures to claim funds revealed the privkey. However, the script shown had all CODESEPARATOR in a single branch, and the details were difficult to parse through the mailing list.</p>
