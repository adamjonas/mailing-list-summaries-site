    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Johnson Lau explains the use of CLTV in a weird "compare two numbers that are committed to in the signatures" operation and clarifies that the required locktime is many years in the past. They discuss the use of OP_CSV (BIP112) and conclude that it is not needed here as BIP68 should be sufficient for their use case and would save them a few bytes. In the unilateral case, they explain that one party isn't there anymore or refuses to sign, so they take the trigger transaction and the latest update_n transaction and broadcast them. Then, they wait for the CSV timeout to expire and then send the settlement transaction, which gives them the enforcement of the latest state that they agreed on. The worst-case scenario involves four transactions, while the best case involves two transactions. However, if no one is cheating, they only need three transactions.</p>
