    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group consisting of Suredbits and Crypto Garage has started working on a protocol specification for the use of discreet log contracts (DLCs) in a safe, private, and interoperable way. They aim to create a set of documents similar to BIPs and BOLTs that will allow others to easily integrate the technology into the protocol. The goal is also to remain compatible with standards used by other Bitcoin-related protocols such as Lightning, so software integration can be streamlined. The specification repository is available on GitHub, and more information about DLCs can be found through various links provided in the email. A community feedback is also solicited to agree on a common standard for using Bitcoin oracles. LL suggested that Schnorr-based DLCs can be done in two transactions, which can also be implemented in Bitcoin as it is today using ECDSA adaptor signatures, which are easier to specify and implement besides being cheaper and more private.</p>
