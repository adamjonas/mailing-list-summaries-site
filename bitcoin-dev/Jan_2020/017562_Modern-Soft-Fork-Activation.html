    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Taproot process aims to improve Bitcoin by updating its protocol. The update is expected to be less controversial than previous ones, but there is concern that it might face similar challenges. BIP-9 requires 95% readiness signaling from miners for activation, but if this threshold isn't met, the activation may be delayed for 2.5 years, which would be a total of 3.5 years since merge time. The protocol can sustain hash power fluctuations, making momentary loss of hash rate preferable to such long delays. Notably, BIP-91 was deployed specifically to reduce the 95% requirement down to 80% during the segwit drama, which could encourage similar games. To prevent malicious attempts to delay activation, Matt suggests decreasing the 95% threshold down to around 80%.</p>
