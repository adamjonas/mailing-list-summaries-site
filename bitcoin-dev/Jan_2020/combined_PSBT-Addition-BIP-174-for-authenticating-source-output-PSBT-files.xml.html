        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Peter D. Gray and Andrew Chow, the possibility of adding signatures inside PSBT files was discussed as a way to detect and prevent certain classes of bugs. Gray suggested that by having signers add a signature at the end of the PSBT file, it would allow for later users to verify that a file has not been corrupted by a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. However, Chow argued that this approach is not very useful as it only protects against one specific leg of the protocol and does not cover other places where there could be a MiTM.In a bitcoin-dev discussion, the possibility of using signatures to protect against PSBT parsing bugs was brought up. The creator suggested byte-level signatures covering the entire file contents to protect against parsing bugs. While there are non-linear PSBT paths that would be difficult or impossible to support with this approach, it would still be effective in most setups today. Members also discussed whether proprietary keys would be necessary or if they could wait for an officially-assigned key number. Ultimately, the discussion seemed to indicate that using out-of-band communication methods like PGP signing the PSBT might be more effective in protecting against MiTM attacks.The email thread discussed the proposal for adding two officially-assigned BIP-174 key numbers to signatures in the PSBT, which would allow detection and mitigation of broad "bug-classes." The need for additional structure requirements over a simple key-value structure was questioned given the complexity it adds to PSBT processing. The proposal does not address the issue of a MitM having control over both directions.In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter D. Gray of Coinkite proposed adding signatures to partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) in order to protect against PSBT parsing bugs. Andrew Chow and Dmitry Petukhov expressed skepticism about the proposal. Petukhov suggested that authentication information should be stored outside of the PSBT structure in a separate container. Gray responded by noting that he believed his proposed approach was more compatible with existing PSBT structures.The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around a proposal for adding authentication information to partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBTs). While some members agree with the idea, others have reservations. Andrew agrees with Dmitry and does not see the point of having MiTM protection within the PSBT structure itself. He suggests doing the protection with out-of-band communication. Petukhov believes that introducing additional ordering or other structural requirements over simple key-value structure will add complexity to PSBT processing.Dmitry suggests implementing the envisioned scheme with proprietary keys, documenting and promoting it, instead of waiting for officially-assigned key numbers. If it shows its usefulness, it will either become a de-facto standard with proprietary keys, or the scheme will have serious grounds to be converted to standard and have non-proprietary keys assigned.</p>
