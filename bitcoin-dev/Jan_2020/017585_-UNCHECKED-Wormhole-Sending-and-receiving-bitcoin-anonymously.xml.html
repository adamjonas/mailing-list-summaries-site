    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A protocol called Wormhole has been proposed to transfer bitcoin with a great level of privacy for both the sender and receiver. The protocol is based on minor tweaks to the Zero Link CoinJoin protocol using a centralized coordinator who cannot steal or spy, and Schnorr blind signatures to obfuscate the link between inputs and equal value outputs throughout the ceremony. Inputs are registered by generating input proof while blinded outputs and change addresses are generated. Output registration starts when confirmed unique IDs are equal to registered inputs, or when there is a timeout and confirmed unique IDs are greater than or equal to required inputs. The result is that the sender and receiver have anonymous equal value zero link outputs with anonymity set, and the coordinator does not know who controls which equal value output. Communication is interactive with several rounds of communication, including direct communication between A and B. The Wormhole protocol might be used in conjunction with Pay to Endpoint or Knapsack, or integrated with atomic coin swaps with Schnorr adaptor signatures.</p>
