    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The activation methods for soft forks have been reopened for discussion, with a focus on avoiding activation in the face of significant, reasonable and directed objection. Matt Corallo proposes using BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for activation with 95% miner readiness. If no activation occurs within a year, there will be a six-month quieting period for analysis and discussion before users can opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month time horizon for flag-day activation. The proposal also aims to avoid activating within an inadequate timeframe, prevent hashpower loss from un-upgraded miners, use hashpower enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process and follow the will of the community without overruling any reasonable objections. Additionally, luke-jr suggested that consensus rules could require blocks to signal for activation in the last activation window, which may make it easier for users to resist an unwanted change they oppose.</p>
