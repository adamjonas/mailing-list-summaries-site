        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new protocol named Wormhole has been proposed to transfer Bitcoin with a high level of privacy for both the sender and receiver. The protocol is based on minor tweaks to the Zero Link CoinJoin protocol, which uses a centralized coordinator who cannot steal or spy. Schnorr blind signatures are used to obscure the link between inputs and equal value outputs throughout the ceremony. The result is that the sender and receiver have anonymous equal value zero link outputs with anonymity set, and the coordinator does not know who controls which equal value output. The communication between A and B can be done on any sufficiently private channel, including but not limited to tor, QR codes, SD cards, or carrier pigeon. The equal value zero link outputs from A and B have the anonymity set of the total number of equal value zero link outputs in the same transaction. Wormhole breaks the assumption that zero links are a consolidation within the same wallet. It is an interactive protocol with several rounds of communication, so all A and B and W need to be online. The protocol can be used in conjunction with Pay to Endpoint or Knapsack so that A can send a specific amount to B, with part being the equal value zero link output, and part the P2EP change, or Knapsack sub-transaction. Atomic coinswaps with Schnorr adaptor signatures might be integrated, so A input in `CJTX1` "pays" B output in `CJTX2`, but this might require B to know the signature [and thus the input] of A. This protocol has many potential applications in the world of cryptocurrency and could significantly improve the privacy of Bitcoin transactions.</p>
