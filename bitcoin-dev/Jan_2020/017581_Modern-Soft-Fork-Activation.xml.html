    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the activation of softforks in the Bitcoin network, BIP 9 was mentioned as a fairly robust option despite misunderstandings about activation parameters. However, Luke Dashjr argued that BIP 9 has its flaws and proposed revising BIP 8 with a mandatory signal to address these issues. He believes that flag day softforks leave the network in a state of ambiguity, where it is unclear whether the new rules have been violated or not until it actually happens. This uncertainty can cause people to shy away from relying on the new rules, and there is no clear way to intentionally reject the softfork. To address these concerns, Luke proposed adding a mandatory signal after the softfork period, where old miners could resume mining unchanged. While this would cause a temporary loss of hashrate to the network, he believes it is better than the alternatives and would improve the long-term security of the network hashrate. Additionally, he noted that efforts to revise BIP 8 were temporarily abandoned but should be resumed now.</p>
