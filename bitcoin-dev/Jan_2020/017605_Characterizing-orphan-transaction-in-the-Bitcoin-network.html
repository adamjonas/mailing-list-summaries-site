    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The paper presented in this context discusses the impact of orphan transactions on the Bitcoin network. Orphan transactions are those whose parental income sources are missing at the time they are processed, causing them to languish in a local buffer until their missing parents are found. The study aims to characterize the nature and impact of such orphans through a measurement campaign of orphan transactions on live Bitcoin nodes. Surprisingly, orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions. Their missing parents are characterized by lower fees and larger sizes, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte. The network overhead incurred by these orphan transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size of 100 transactions. However, the paper shows that increasing the size of the orphan pool to 1000 transactions can make this overhead negligible without significant computational or memory demands.</p>
