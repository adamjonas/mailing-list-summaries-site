    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The OP_VAULT draft has undergone several improvements since the last related correspondence. The hard dependence on package relay/ephemeral anchors for fee management has been removed, making it possible to bundle all vault-related transactions with unrelated inputs and outputs. As a result, fee management is now self-contained in the transaction, making the contents of this proposal usable today. Additionally, specific output locations are no longer hardcoded in any of the transaction validation algorithms, ensuring compatibility with future changes like SIGHASH_GROUP and increasing transaction shapes for vault operations' flexibility. The proposal can be found in its entirety in a BIP written by Jamesob and available on GitHub. The corresponding PR is also available on GitHub, and Jamesob's next step will be to try for a merge to the inquisition repo. Jamesob expresses his gratitude to everyone who has participated so far, especially AJ and Greg for their advice.</p>
