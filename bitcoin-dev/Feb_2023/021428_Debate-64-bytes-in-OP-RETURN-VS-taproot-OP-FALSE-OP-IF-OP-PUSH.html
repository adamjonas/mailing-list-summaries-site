    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation started with a question regarding the official channel to request an OP_RETURN size change for Bitcoin. The simplified version is that changes start with discussions and are then moved to a PR to bitcoin-core with code changes and an introductory comment pointing to discussions elsewhere. Getting review of the PRs can be challenging, as contributors need to evangelize and/or have social capital in the Bitcoin community to get sufficient ACKs and NACKs. At some point, if there is enough interest and few objections, the maintainers will merge the proposal based on their sense of the community's interest and consensus. This process is not very transparent, even for a good proposal. Once released, this type of change can only happen after sufficient miners and nodes update to the release and turn it on.
