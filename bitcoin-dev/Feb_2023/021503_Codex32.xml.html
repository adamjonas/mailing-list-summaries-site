    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of using a "quick check" to verify the integrity of each Codex32 share independently without using a computer. A "quick check" verification can be done for any size of verification from 1 character to upto the full 13 characters, and partial verifications will have BCH properties. The process involves starting with a specified initial state with a pair of Bech32 characters, adding the first character after the prefix by using the addition volvelle or lookup table and then looking up the new state in a lookup table. The process is repeated until the final state is reached, which should be '5'. The email also mentions that an adjustment could be made to the Codex32 generator so that this 1 character "quick check" table would become identical to the Bech32 addition table, but it would come at a cost of losing a special property of having three identical coefficients in a row.The email further suggests that a specialized worksheet would help guide the process and make it easier to follow. However, the writer notes that the 1 character quick check is too small to be safely used and recommends people performing quick checks use a minimum size of 2, which has a 0.1% failure rate. The difference between using the addition table/volvelle versus a specific table/volvelle for the purpose of performing 1 character quick checks is pretty minimal. In addition, the email thread discusses the possibility of creating a simple mod N=0 checksum as a much simpler approach to verify a share by itself. This approach is possible to compute by hand with a word/symbol->number lookup table and pen and paper or a calculator. The email suggests that all shares have mod N checksums, and it may be sufficient for everyone to write down the checksums of the other shares to verify they are correct. Finally, the email notes that small checksums aren't foolproof, but a relatively easy procedure with a 1-in-1000 chance of an error going undetected is preferred over a complex procedure that people don't actually do at all.</p>
