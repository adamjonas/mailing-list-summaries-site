    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Peter Todd and Daniel Lipshitz, Lipshitz states that his company does not have any knowledge of KYC/AML information or telephone numbers of those sending bitcoin for deposit on their clients' platforms. The only information they have is public bitcoin information such as transaction hash and output address shared with them via API. Todd responds by stating that Lipshitz's company knows who their clients are and that learning what addresses are associated with what entity is a significant benefit to Chainalysis operations. However, Lipshitz disagrees, estimating that over 90% of their clients use different AML transaction analysis service providers for transactions deposited on their platforms, rendering the data irrelevant to them. Lipshitz also mentions that his company services payment processors and liquidity providers and has little insight into which wallets or merchants their clients service. Additionally, many of the cluster addresses of their clients are publicly known, just like Max had no issue sharing the cluster of his deposit address in an email posted to the list.</p>
