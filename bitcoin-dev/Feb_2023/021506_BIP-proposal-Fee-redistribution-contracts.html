    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Bachelor's thesis proposes a new way of distributing transaction fees. Instead of miners taking all the fees, they would take a fraction M and the remaining fraction C would be sent to one or more contracts that collect fees from the miner and redistribute them back to the miner in a "smarter" way. The proposal is aimed at making mining more secure and predictable against drastic fluctuations in fees. The benefits are discussed in the paper, and it is suggested that most miners should not oppose this solution as it creates a better mining environment. However, there are some flaws with the proposal, such as the difficulty in constructing the smart contract and convincing the ecosystem to change the mining incentive structure from competitive to cooperative. Additionally, the distribution in block creation is described as exponential on page two, but it is actually poisson. It remains uncertain whether long-term mining incentives will be a problem and what solutions should be implemented. Further discussion is needed on achieving miner consensus in implementing and updating the fee-redistribution scheme.</p>
