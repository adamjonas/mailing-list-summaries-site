    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the use of coinjoin transactions and possible vulnerabilities. The latest signer may provide an inflated witness which downgrades the multi-party transaction feerate, causing transaction-relay jamming. The goal of the adversary is to slow down the confirmation of the transaction to waste time value. The issue has been mentioned for updating Core's mempool acceptance policy and allowing wtxid-replacement. The estimated witness size messages in the dual funding proposal could create a false sense of validation for an adversary to have their ordinal inscriptions paid by someone else by subverting the agreed upon feerate. RBF by default is recommended as it provides stronger deterrents to such protocols. The main takeaway is that full RBF is required for incentive compatible multiparty transactions or the closest approximation of incentive compatibility possible barring future soft forks. None of the currently deployed protocols are vulnerable, but RBF is necessary for incentive compatibility.</p>
