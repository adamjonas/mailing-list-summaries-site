    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed the possibility of using static analysis to determine whether an IF branch could ever be taken. Andrew Poelstra suggested that such filtering, if done reliably and efficiently, would force inscription scripts to be "plausible" and increase their space cost by requiring OP_DROP to be added numerous times. Peter Todd questioned the actual percentage increase this would cause, with Poelstra estimating a little over 1% according to standardness rules, and less than 0.2% according to consensus. The discussion highlighted the need for protocols relying on data embedded in Bitcoin transactions to have flexible encoding rules, allowing encoders to adapt on-the-fly if any censorship issues arise. It was also noted that OpenTimestamps was designed with this property in mind.</p>
