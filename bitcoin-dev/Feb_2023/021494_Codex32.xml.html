    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 15, 2023, Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, announced on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list that he had opened a PR to the BIPs repo for a new scheme. Pavol Rusnak, David Harding, and Christopher Allen were thanked for their comments on the draft text which had been updated to address concerns. The changes included more text in the "Motivation" section distinguishing the scheme from SLIP-39, further details on the error correction capabilities of the code, an explanation that the code does not defend against malicious errors, and additional instructions on creating shares. A note was also added to use uppercase for QR codes, and text was added about hand-computation of share verification in the "Motivation" section. Andrew requested anyone who would like to be listed under Acknowledgements to let him know on the PR.</p>
