    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the standard for OP_RETURN and its limitations has been brought up. It is understood that the data is limited to 80B and only one OP_RETURN is allowed in one transaction, otherwise the transaction is non-standard. There are debates on whether to store in witness or output addresses with large size. However, there is a storage workaround but some people are opposed to an OP_RETURN bitcoin storage. The maximum size was thought to be 512B but apparently it is 80B which limits its functionality. Storage is the main difference between bitcoin and other systems like Ethereum, and without it, the future of bitcoin is limited. Christopher Allen posed a question regarding placing 64-bytes into the Bitcoin blockchain through traditional OP_RETURN or spent taproot transactions. He acknowledged that anti-OP_RETURN folk would say “neither” but if there was no other choice, such as for a timestamp or commitment, which is better? The taproot method is proposed as a better option but others may disagree. Aymeric Vitte's contact information and various projects related to Bitcoin were also included at the end of the post.</p>
