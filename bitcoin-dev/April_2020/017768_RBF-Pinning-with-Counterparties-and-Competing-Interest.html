    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Matt Corallo discussed the limitations of Bitcoin contracts with nested trees of transaction to confirm. They also talked about how mempool-watching could be used as a mitigation measure against attacks on Lightning nodes. There was disagreement on the complexity of mempool-watching and the requirements for lightning nodes that seek to be part of the public routing network with a desire to forward HTLCs. Osuntokun suggested that mempool-watching is less involved and could resolve issues like eliminating the commitment fee guessing game, allowing users to pay less on force close, and reliably enforcing multi-hop HTLC resolution. Corallo proposed pre-signing all HTLC output spends instead of making the HTLC output spending more free-form with SIGHASH_ANYONECAN_PAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE. However, Osuntokun pointed out that this would require an overhaul in the channel state machine to make presenting a new commitment take at least two phases.</p>
