    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses a proposal to solve the issue of undesirable transactions in the mempool that are difficult to evict. The proposed solution involves limiting the size of low-fee-rate packages in the mempool to prevent an attacker from building off a low fee-rate root transaction and sending thousands of low fee-rate transactions, which can lead to DoS attacks on Bitcoin nodes. The proposal suggests tightening the mempool acceptance rules to prevent low-fee-rate packages from growing while retaining the "cannot evict high absolute fee" rule. However, it is not clear whether this solution would break other existing uses. Another alternative proposal has been discussed, which involves allowing transactors to mark their transactions as "likely-to-be-RBF'ed", enabling a relay policy where children of such transactions would be rejected unless the resulting package would be "near the top of the mempool". This alternative proposal introduces too many constants and is unclear what happens as the mempool prevailing feerate changes.</p>
