    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj has expressed concern that a particular technique is not compatible with payment points. The main privacy advantage of using points is that nobody except for B can recognize the signature as revealing the scalar behind a particular point. However, even variations on this technique are not usable with payment points. Matt Corallo suggests an alternative solution by focusing on sending the pinning transaction to miner nodes directly, which is achievable by bribing them for knowledge. This method involves creating a bribe via LN first, and smaller miners with LN nodes would have an equal chance of claiming the bribe. Bob will learn the preimage once the child transaction is included in a block or earlier if his wallet is monitoring for relays of spends from his parent transaction. However, this requires additional complexity in LN clients and people to run additional software to keep track of potential preimages. While some may view this as less desirable than the protocol changes under discussion in other parts of this thread, it might be largely addressed in the same general way as watchtowers and other enforcement-assistance services.</p>
