    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email outlines several important considerations in relation to CoinSwap, a privacy-enhancing Bitcoin protocol. One issue is the practical limit on the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that can be received in a swap, as each UTXO increases the potential fee required to spend them. However, blockchain analysts can bound the set size to make the problem less than NP in practice. Another consideration is that if a single UTXO is split and then swapped, it becomes a hint on how the subset sums can be tried. Furthermore, if the UTXOs received in a swap are spent together in a single transaction, the solution to the subset sum problem is published to the adversary. To mitigate this weakness, fewer, larger UTXOs should be used for more flexibility in spending later. Additionally, some UTXO management techniques may be needed to avoid combining different UTXOs in a known set into the same transaction by default. Finally, the author suggests reaching out to others who have been working on privacy tech, such as belcher, waxwing, and nopara73.</p>
