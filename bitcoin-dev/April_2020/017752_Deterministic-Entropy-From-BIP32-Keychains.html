    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Adam, shared his thoughts on the use-case of having an offline seed manager in a recent email. He believes that it can be backed up once and support multiple wallets, which solves a practical and under-addressed problem for many users and businesses. He also noted that using a bip39 mnemonic seed as an interface between an offline seed manager and a hardware or software wallet is convenient and an improvement over using custom derivation paths, given the complexity of custom paths and variable support for them in wallets.In another email, Rodolfo Novak via bitcoin-dev announced plans to implement the Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains BIP on Coldcard. He asked if there was a planned BIP number and if there had been any review of the BIP yet.</p>
