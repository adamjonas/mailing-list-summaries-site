    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email suggests a solution to tackle the problem of value-based correlations by modeling it after an equal-sum-subset problem. The proposed solution involves swapping UTXOs of similar value sets, which can be broken up randomly using different keys and randomized locktimes. However, there are practical limitations to the number of UTXOs that can be received in the swap as every UTXO increases the potential fee to spend them. Additionally, splitting a single UTXO and swapping it can provide hints on how subset sums can be tried. Moreover, spending the UTXOs received in a single transaction can publish the solution to the subset sum for adversaries. It is suggested to get in touch with belcher, waxwing, and nopara73, who have been working on privacy tech for a long time, to know about other issues or solutions to the problems mentioned above.</p>
