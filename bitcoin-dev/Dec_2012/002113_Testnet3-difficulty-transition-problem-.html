    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Two blocks, block 38304 and block 40320, are difficulty transition blocks. Even though both of these blocks have difficulties that should make them impossible to mine, block 40320 has a difficulty of 1 due to a special testnet rule. It was previously believed that this rule could not be applied to difficulty transition blocks.However, bitcoinj based clients do not advance their blockchain past block 40319, likely due to the discrepancy in the difficulty of block 40320. This information suggests that there may be additional rules or exceptions related to difficulty transitions that are not yet fully understood.</p>
