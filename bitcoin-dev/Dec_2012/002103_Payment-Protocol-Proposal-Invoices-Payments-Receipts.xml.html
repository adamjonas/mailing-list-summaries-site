    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this thread, Mike Hearn suggests that protocol buffers are the best option to use for a particular issue, and urges others to drop the binary vs text debate. He notes that there are no compelling arguments to use text and that there are several obvious problems with it. If someone thinks they have a good argument for using JSON, he encourages them to research protocol buffers more thoroughly to see if it changes their mind.
