    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on December 22, 2012, Andreas Schildbach asked about two blocks with difficulty transitions. While block 40320 had a difficulty of 1, Schildbach thought that this exception could not be used on difficulty transition blocks. However, he was informed that the difficulty change is relative to the prior block's difficulty, so if the penultimate block in the difficulty cycle is under the special rule, the difficulty change will be relative to 1. The timewarp attack had been added to the testnet chain, but the test case was intentionally avoided in case they wanted to fix it before testnet3's release.</p>
