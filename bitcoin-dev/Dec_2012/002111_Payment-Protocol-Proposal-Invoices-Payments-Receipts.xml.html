    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposes that implementing secure, private messaging is the first task at hand for any payment protocol, as messages sent between wallets need to be secured. The proposal suggests using one or more ECC key pairs for signing and encrypting messages, which can be shared or exported/imported between wallets. The need for verifying public keys using PKI is not necessary, as people can make do without it and use PGP or other PKI if required. For a payment protocol, the author suggests using SSL certificates/CAs as one method of obtaining an ECC public key. This approach does not require people to obtain new certificates just for bitcoin. The proposal also suggests that having a uniform method of securing messages sent between wallets, which doesn't depend on external tools, would be a significant step forward.</p>
