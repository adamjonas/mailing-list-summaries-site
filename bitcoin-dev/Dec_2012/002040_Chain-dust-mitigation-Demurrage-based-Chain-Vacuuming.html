    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, 1 Satoshi payouts are mainly sourced from Satoshi Dice. It is unclear whether these small payouts are a result of people placing 1 satoshi bets or if it is part of their messaging system. Pieter Wuille argues that it is unlikely that a consensus can be reached to address this issue, and he personally would not support it. However, the problem of unspent outputs using disk space is not urgent as disk space is cheap, and the working set is determined by moving coins rather than those that are stationary. Nonetheless, if these 1 satoshi outputs were being spent more frequently, it could increase the working set size. Finally, some of these coins may eventually be cleared by adjusting wallets to consolidate outputs into change outputs during transactions with spare space before reaching the next fee level.</p>
