    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the difficulties faced by people who want to use Bitcoin. These issues were collected from Facebook, and include questions about the purpose of Bitcoin, how to download wallets, how to send Bitcoins without fees, and how to speed up synchronization with the network. The author suggests that listening to end-users is important in refining requirements for software engineering. The rest of the email thread includes a discussion about the risks of promoting SPV nodes to new users and the importance of full nodes for security. There is also a debate about the current experience being poor and the need to make the software more user-friendly. However, the author maintains that promoting less capable and secure software is not the solution and that painless software should not compromise security.</p>
