    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion between Melvin Carvalho and Mike Koss took place regarding the migration to textual representation of data structures over binary ones. Mike proposed that JSON should be used due to its success in internet standards, but suggested signing the text representation of a UTF8 JSON instead of a complex encoding standard. Melvin agreed with Mike's proposition and added that binary formats can cause challenges when converting to other formats, like ASN.1 in PKI world, which leads to fragmented X.509 and GPG, creating silos. JSON offers significant advantages in this aspect, however, Jeff Garzik pointed out that JSON has disadvantages as well, requiring an additional middle layer between JSON and application to ensure that all fields are output in the same order, which can become complicated.</p>
