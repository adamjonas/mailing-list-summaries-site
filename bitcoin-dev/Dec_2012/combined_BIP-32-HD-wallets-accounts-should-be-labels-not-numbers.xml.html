    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Amir Taaki and Pieter Wuille, Amir suggested the idea of allowing people to input labels instead of numbers for different accounts in a wallet application. However, Pieter mentioned that there was no way to iterate over all strings and that the intention behind assigning incrementing numbers to accounts was to detect new accounts that become in use during disaster recovery. He did mention that he wouldn't mind adding the ability to do "non-standard derivations" using arbitrary strings if this recoverability property was not desired. Amir also asked about the reasoning behind serializing points using a compressed format before going into the hash function. Pieter responded that there was no compelling reason to encourage uncompressed public keys anymore on the network and that it made sense to standardize on just compressed keys. He mentioned that the encoding itself was not hard - just 0x02 or 0x03 (depending on whether Y is even or odd) followed by the 32-byte encoding of X. Decoding was harder but was never needed in the derivation. Software internally can use any representation which stores both X and Y. Decoding compressed public keys is somewhat harder, as Y must be reconstructed, but the algorithm isn't hard.</p>
