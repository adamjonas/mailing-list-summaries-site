    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the issue of how to handle payment requests with certain outputs specifying an amount and others not. The option of allowing repeated outputs is being considered, but it may make the specification more complex. However, it is necessary for generators of payment requests to keep their income in unlinkable chunks of a size that's up to them. While some people are asking if unsigned payment requests would be possible for bitcoin clients to accept, displaying an address isn't really helpful to users, so it's better to just show the size of the request.Regarding the use of root CAs, it is suggested that only those who have gone through the process of obtaining permission to issue EV certificates should be included. However, these hoops only apply for EV certificates, and merchants might have to buy new ones if they don't use browser root CAs. This could be annoying for them, so it's better to stick with browser root CAs.</p>
