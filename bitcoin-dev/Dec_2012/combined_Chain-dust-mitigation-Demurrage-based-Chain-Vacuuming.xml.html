    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, several topics related to Bitcoin are discussed. Andreas Petersson proposes the ability for users to switch between different coin selection policies and Mike Hearn mentions that 1 satoshi payouts are part of Satoshi Dice's messaging system. Michael Gronager emphasizes that Bitcoin is not a democracy and changes to the rules require near-universal consensus. He suggests paying miners for unmoved coins to incentivize the reduction of the UTXO set size. However, others disagree due to economic hazards, and they suggest making client software more aggressive about sweeping up dust inputs and changing the default relay and mining rules to penalize small outputs and further incentivize reductions in the UTXO set size.They conclude that such actions would be the most basic prerequisites for any kind of argument that something more drastic, especially something that some would consider theft, is essential. Additionally, they acknowledge that implementing any change requires a hard fork and that changes should reflect what people signed up for when using the system.The power granted to miners is limited to deciding the order of valid transactions, and they have no ability to control the rules for validity. Satoshi Nakamoto deliberately did not leave the rules preventing double spending and monetary inflation of Bitcoin to miners, as they could vote to keep the 50 BTC block payout.Anonymity was never a core feature of the network, and the reference client could handle the issue of dust from any address by default, with users having the option of disabling that behavior. However, this may trigger infrequently due to sane software paying change to fresh addresses. One solution to this problem would be to not apply the privacy rule to very small inputs or to addresses that have only ever received a small sum total. However, defining "very small" robustly would be difficult. Another proposal is demurrage to recycle pennies over time, where unspent transaction outputs age out if not re-transacted. This would require planning at least one to two years in advance for a hard fork, which may not solve the problem given that the economic landscape of Bitcoin may be vastly different by then.A solution could be to change the mining policy to prioritize transactions that reduce the number of UTXOs.</p>
