    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion took place on December 3, 2012, between Roy Badami and Mike Hearn regarding the design of SMTP. Mike Hearn expressed his frustration with the fact that one cannot start a paragraph with the word "From" due to it being a new message marker in SMTP. However, Roy Badami clarified that this is not related to SMTP but rather the file format of the standard BSD UNIX mailbox. Jeff Garzik added that the use of "." terminator in SMTP also causes confusion. He suggested that data that is not being interpreted should not need to be escaped and unescaped.</p>
