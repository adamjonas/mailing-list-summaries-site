    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 17, 2012, Melvin Carvalho sent an email stating, "If the decision has already been made, then let's go with that." This was in reference to a decision that had been previously discussed and agreed upon. The response from Gavin Andresen was simply, "The decision has already been made." It is unclear what the decision was regarding as there is no further context provided.It is worth noting that this exchange took place via email and was not part of a larger conversation thread. Additionally, the email included an HTML attachment that was apparently scrubbed from the message. There is no information available on the content of this attachment or why it was removed.Overall, this brief exchange seems to suggest that a decision was made and both parties involved were aware of it. However, without more information it is impossible to determine what the decision was or what impact it may have had.</p>
