    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concern was raised regarding the need to re-transact coins to keep them safe from "vultures", which could result in expanding the block chain instead of reducing growth. However, it was noted that this would not happen at the rate suggested. Another issue raised was the imposition of hard limits that pass a value judgement that should not be present in the protocol, which could cause difficulty for the normal user who only sees their balance as one number. Additionally, it was pointed out that introducing such changes to the protocol would be challenging. As a solution, it was suggested that a better set of relay fee rules rewarding a decrease in the number of UTXOs would be an easier way forward.</p>
