    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 3, 2012, Mike Koss expressed his concern about the reliance on X.509 in the original specification and suggested an alternative option that allows for out-of-band trust based on ECDSA. He also proposed that migrating to textual representations of data structures would be more accessible for developers with JSON being his preferred candidate. Gavin Andresen updated the spec on December 1, 2012, adding version numbers to the messages, best-practice is to know what version of something you're expecting before parsing it. He also added a field to the SignedInvoice message for invoice version number. Handling of receiptURI errors was also added to the spec, requiring clients to prepare for the case of an evil merchant that returns accepted=false but broadcasts the transactions anyway. A TODO section with base64-encoded test vectors was also added to the spec. Binary formats can be challenging to convert into other formats and have not been great in terms of interop. In that respect, JSON offers significant advantages over binary formats in the PKI world, which is one of the reasons why X.509 and GPG are fragmented and lack a widely deployed web of trust on the net.</p>
