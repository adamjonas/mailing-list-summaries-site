    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The features discussed in this context are useful, but they appear to be contradictory. The proposed feature would enable users to switch between different coin selection policies such as "minimize fees," "max privacy," "defragmentation," or even "I don't care." It is envisioned that users would be able to switch between these policies for individual sends. This feature would provide users with greater flexibility and control over their cryptocurrency transactions. The "minimize fees" policy would allow users to select the coins with the lowest transaction fees, while the "max privacy" policy would prioritize coins with higher levels of anonymity. The "defragmentation" policy would aim to consolidate multiple small inputs into a single output to reduce transaction fees and improve overall efficiency. Finally, the "I don't care" policy would let the wallet choose the best coins based on its own algorithm without any input from the user.This proposed feature could potentially solve the issue of conflicting priorities when selecting coins for transactions. However, it remains to be seen how well it would work in practice and whether it would introduce new issues or complications. Nonetheless, this feature has the potential to greatly enhance user experience by allowing them to tailor their coin selection process to their specific needs and preferences.</p>
