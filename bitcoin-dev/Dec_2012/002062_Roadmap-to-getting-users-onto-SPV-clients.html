    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin.org website currently recommends users download the full client, but there is a need for presenting other options. The recommendation to download Bitcoin-Qt is turning users away, so a roadmap or plan needs to be created for changing this. MultiBit is maturing into a client that could be recommended to end users who take the fast-start path, although it still has some lacks. There doesn't necessarily have to be one true client, and an alternative option would be to make Bitcoin-Qt have an SPV mode. The integration of charting and exchange rate feeds in MultiBit are unique features that could be useful. Overall, the community should discuss and decide on the best approach.</p>
