    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Jim suggests the idea of having a logo indicating wallet compatibility for BIP32 and a mnemonic algorithm to make it easier to transfer wallets across various clients. He also mentions that as support for BIP32 is added to clients and codebases, the actual variant of software used to access one's wallet becomes relatively less important. Jim proposes using a standardized seed -> passphrase algorithm so that users can just type in their long passphrase into any BIP32 compliant software and have access to their wallet. Slush responds by informing Jim that he has asked ThomasV to make a BIP from his mnemonic algorithm, to which ThomasV agreed, and a proposal will be available soon.</p>
