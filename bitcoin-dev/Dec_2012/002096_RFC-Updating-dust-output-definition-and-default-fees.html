    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin repository on GitHub has recently had a pull request submitted that proposes updates to the COIN_DUST constant, which represents the dust spam limit used. The proposal includes a decrease of the COIN_DUST value from 0.01 BTC to 0.001 BTC. This is due to the increase in bitcoin value, which currently stands at US$13.67. The rationale behind this change is to reduce the value level at which dust spam is considered. Additionally, the update proposes changes to the TX miner and relay fee defaults. The proposed defaults would be set to 0.001 BTC and 0.0005 BTC respectively. This update reflects the growth of dust spam in the unspent transaction output dataset. Miners who mine with this code will need to include transactions with outputs equal to or greater than 0.0005 BTC and require a fee greater than or equal to 0.001 BTC to relay transactions with outputs of 0.0005 BTC. Overall, the review of impact shows a reduction in the definition of COIN_DUST and changes to the required fees for miners to include and relay transactions.</p>
