    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed message names are facing some push-back, as "Invoice" in the accounting world means something different from what is being proposed. Further, there are already three to four existing standards for electronic invoices, which might create confusion. Therefore, the message names will be changed to PaymentRequest, Payment, and PaymentACK (payment acknowledgement), respectively. Additionally, bootstrapping details will not be included in the specification, as it makes sense to keep the URI extension separate from the binary message format. Finally, a simple mechanism for extending the protocol will be defined, as follows: "message Invoice {extensions 1000 to max;}"</p>
