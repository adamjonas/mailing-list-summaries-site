    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mark Friedenbach responded to Alan's UTxO meta-chain proposal and stated that although the merge of ultraprune makes it somewhat easier, there are still challenges ahead. These include inventing and reaching consensus on a normative data structure, as well as writing implementations of required operations. There is also the issue of deciding on a single data structure for the normative merkle tree representation for the UTxO set, which could preclude other potentially faster implementations. Another issue that needs to be sorted out is key structure, where disagreements must be resolved to determine the normative structure. While the proposed meta-chain could allow the Satoshi client to operate with a greater than or equal to SPV level of security during initial block download, Mark acknowledges the benefits of starting fast with reduced security. This would allow users to view their balances, send and receive transactions, and go about their business during the initial block download, except for mining. Overall, there are still challenges to overcome before the UTxO meta-chain proposal can become a reality.</p>
