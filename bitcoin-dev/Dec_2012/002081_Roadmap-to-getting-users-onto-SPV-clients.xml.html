    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses various issues related to the use of Bitcoin by end-users. Jim Nguyen shared some user feedback he collected from Facebook, where users were having difficulty with understanding Bitcoin's purpose, DEP protection, fees, and synchronization. Gregory Maxwell argues that promoting SPV (purely-consuming) nodes to new users has a real risk of centralizing the network. He also believes that it is not a good idea to promote less capable and secure software to users for the sake of making the software painless for them. Wladimir suggests that the best way to improve the Bitcoin experience is to work on improving the Satoshi client's security and stability. While many initiatives are underway to improve the client, they take time, as open-source development is usually done during free time. The email thread concludes with a discussion on the need for a healthy darknet of private authenticated peerings between miners and other likely targets to address the concern of sybil attackers.</p>
