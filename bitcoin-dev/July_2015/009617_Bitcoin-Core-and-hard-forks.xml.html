    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted to the Bitcoin development mailing list in 2015, Eric Lombrozo argued that increasing the block size would not impede the progress of research and development of Lightning or other technologies. Lombrozo also stated that those who claimed that fee pressure would scare away users and break the industry were underestimating human ingenuity. He believed that the community could find good solutions to the fee market challenge. According to Lombrozo, it was necessary to increase the block size to pay for the operation of the network. Delaying this action would make it more difficult to solve the problem in the future due to lower block rewards, larger infrastructure, and a larger userbase.</p>
