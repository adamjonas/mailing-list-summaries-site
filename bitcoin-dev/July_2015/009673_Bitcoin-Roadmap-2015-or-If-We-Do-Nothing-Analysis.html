    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Upon investigation of an IP address, it was found that "OVH" and "Octave Klaba" are listed as the owner. Blockchain.info appears in the HTML header as retrieved by the "Anti-Hacker Alliance". A post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list stated that blockchain.info does not run anything but BitcoinJ and therefore has no proper consensus checking going on. They are connected to a bad peer which doesn't relay inventory but downloads everything. Even though they claim to have hundreds of thousands of wallets, they don't bother running even a single node to sanity check against. The post questions who people will rely on in the future if the load goes higher. It also mentions that companies like CoinBase are claimed to be supporting the network with large blocks because they have a financial incentive to, but they don't do it now when it could be achieved with a $5 VPS.Another post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list explained that blockchain.info's wallet and block explorer has behaved in a way consistent with not running a full node. They have shown invalid data that any full node would reject on multiple occasions, most recently invalid confirmations during the BIP66 fork.</p>
