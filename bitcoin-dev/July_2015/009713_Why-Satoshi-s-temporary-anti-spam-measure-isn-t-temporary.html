    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev thread dated July 29th, 2015, Eric Lombrozo discusses the one megabyte block size limit and its purpose. Lombrozo states that it was not an anti-spam measure, but rather a temporary solution to prevent degradation of user experience in the event of a "DoS block" before alternatives were available. He clarifies that his previous mention of the DoS was in reference to this issue. Another member of the thread argues that this technicality is important because it contradicts Lombrozo's argument that Satoshi did not plan for certain events. The plan was to remove the one megabyte limit once SPV wallets became widespread, but this has not yet happened. Lombrozo then makes a comment about the unreliability of SPV wallets detecting network forks, which seems irrelevant to the discussion.</p>
