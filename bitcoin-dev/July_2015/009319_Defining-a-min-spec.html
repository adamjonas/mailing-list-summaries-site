    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated July 3, 2015, Jeremy Rubin expressed his admiration for Moxie and asked about the health of its development. Rubin had initially thought RISC-V was a good selection due to its active development community, which continuously pushes the performance of ISA implementations forward. The creator of Moxie responded that the processor was designed to be small and efficient from the compiler standpoint, making it easy to audit from a security perspective. Moxie started as a simulator + gcc compiler backend, then later became an FPGA implementation. The hardware side of Moxie could benefit from focused effort to make it more efficient on FPGA, develop and test multi-core support, and other related efforts. This area is currently less mature and needs attention. Those interested can visit <a href="https://github.com/atgreen/moxiedev/tree/master/moxie/cores/moxie">https://github.com/atgreen/moxiedev/tree/master/moxie/cores/moxie</a> to get started. There are also many open source processor cores available at <a href="http://opencores.org">http://opencores.org</a>. Rubin offered to work on designing a Bitcoin specific open-hardware processor up to the FPGA bound if it would be useful for the project.</p>
