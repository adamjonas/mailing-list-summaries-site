    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses the ongoing debate regarding the block size limit in Bitcoin. The author argues that capping the block size will not solve the issues of node count, mining centralization, and developer usage of Bitcoin Core. He believes that a larger block size is necessary for Bitcoin to support a large scale, which is crucial for its competitiveness as a currency. The author also highlights the need for Bitcoin to have many users to ensure its political survival against those who want to regulate or ban it. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of finding a solution to the block size issue to prevent a potential fork and enable Bitcoin's growth.</p>
