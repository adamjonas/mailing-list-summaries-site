    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses different privacy options for query transactions in Bitcoin. The IT-PIR protocol is suggested as a more elegant option than onion routing but still has the problem of collusion. This makes it less desirable than other protocols with different privacy guarantees. The computationally-bounded CPIR option is another possibility, but it does not perform queries faster than the trivial protocol. Another alternative is stealth prefix queries, which allows for client-tuning and does not suffer server collusion attacks nor is it dependent on computational bounds. The primary trade-off becomes result set size against privacy. Additionally, the objective of query privacy is to allow the caller to make the trade-off between the relative levels of privacy and performance. Prefix filtering accomplishes this goal. Finally, the article mentions a potential application for the PIR library and also discusses an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients that uses RSA encryption.</p>
