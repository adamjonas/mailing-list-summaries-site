        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the challenges of defining thresholds for consensus fork activation, with three options available: block.nTime, median time, and block.nHeight. Each option has its own disadvantage, so the author suggests that a solid criteria needs to be established to decide on which option to use. Gavin Andresen believes that using the version and timestamp fields in the block header is the simplest and best way to validate blocks. It allows all block validation except validation against the UTXO to happen in parallel, out-of-order, independent of any other block. However, it has a disadvantage of not being monotonically increasing. There seems to be disagreement on whether miners' upgrade confirmation (aka voting) is necessary for uncontroversial hardforks or not. Jorge Timón suggests that miners' upgrade confirmation is necessary for such proposals, but there seems to be disagreement on this point. Peter Todd clarifies that a strong supermajority of miner support is required to prevent attack, and therefore 95% approval is the minimum safety requirement. However, Hearn's proposal of using centralized checkpoints to override PoW consensus raises serious questions, including legal issues. Todd notes that miners have several options to defeat forks without their approval, such as making their own fork with a new consensus algorithm or attacking the unwanted chain. The author suggests that a uniform threshold mechanism needs to be established instead of using the three options depending on the fork. They express a desire for a more generic solution that can be used for any type of consensus fork.In addition, the issue of whether miners' upgrade confirmation is necessary for uncontroversial hard forks was raised in a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2015 by Jorge Timón. Timón suggested requiring 95% approval as a minimum safety requirement, as this would provide a 50% majority vote, enabling the majority to squelch the minority. However, there seems to be disagreement on this point, with Peter Todd clarifying that a strong supermajority of miner support is required to prevent attack.The author also provides an example hardfork scenario where miners are allowed to create bigger blocks if the transactions help reduce the size of the UTXO. They explain that while block.nTime is available at the block validation level, checking an unconfirmed transaction would require the block.nTime of the next block, which is unpredictable.</p>
