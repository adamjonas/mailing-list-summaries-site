    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the results of a test run on the Bitcoin network to determine if it can safely support a faster block rate. The testing methodology involved randomly selecting nodes from a peers.dat file and downloading a random selection of blocks from each peer. The connecting node was in Amsterdam with a 1GB NIC, and there was some bias towards higher connection speeds, with very slow connections being excluded. The results showed that 37% of connected nodes failed to upload blocks faster than 1MB/s, and only 16% of connected nodes uploaded blocks faster than 10MB/s. Raw data for each connected node can be found at <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6b4NuiVQ">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6b4NuiVQ</a>. This data does not support the theory that the network has the available bandwidth for increased block sizes, as in its current state, 37% of nodes would fail to upload a 20MB block to a single peer in under 20 seconds. Additionally, if the bar for suitability is placed at taking only 1% of the block time (6 seconds) to upload one block to one peer, then 69% of the network fails for 20MB blocks. For comparison, only 10% fail this metric for 1MB blocks. Peter suggests running the test(s) on a simulated network with worst-case network failure(s) to determine the safety margin needed. He also mentioned having potential access to hardware resources that would be available for running such tests at the necessary scales.</p>
