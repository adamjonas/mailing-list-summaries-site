    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Dan Bryant and Luke, it was discussed that when Dan wrote the BIP proposal, he assumed that CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) transaction selection was already being done by miners. However, it was pointed out that this assumption was correct, but not included in the reference policy. It was stated that miners are not expected to use the reference policy as-is and some of them do use CPFP.</p>
