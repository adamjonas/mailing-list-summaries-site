    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, in an email to Tom Harding and the bitcoin-dev mailing list, expressed his frustration with the negativity surrounding discussions of Bitcoin Core and hard forks. He defended his use of quantitative analysis to support his position, stating that it was based on factual information rather than personal bias. Andresen also highlighted the need to consider the impact of changes on other software in the ecosystem, such as Electrum wallets, and suggested working with individuals like Tom and Mike who have a proactive attitude towards scaling up. However, he cautioned against overlooking the importance of maintaining the integrity of the blockchain through proper validation processes.</p>
