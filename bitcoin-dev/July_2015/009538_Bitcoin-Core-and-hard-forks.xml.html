    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mike Hearn argued that Bitcoin Core is running the Bitcoin economy and its developers have the authority to set its rules. However, Bryan Cheng disagreed and stated that upgrading to a new version of Bitcoin Core that is incompatible with one's ideals is not a forced choice, as forks, alternative clients, or staying on an older version are all valid choices. The individual network nodes choose to accept or reject a new release proposed by the developers. There are checks-and-balances in place that make the system work, and consensus is most strongly measured by user actions after software release. If the developers fail to reflect user consensus, the network will let them know. Hearn argued that those who disagree with the developers' rules only have two options: swallow it or fork the project and block chain with it (XT).</p>
