    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tom Harding and Jorge, the two seem to fundamentally disagree on the role of societal adoption in Satoshi's design. Harding argues that adoption is well ahead of Satoshi's schedule, as evidenced by the exchange rate. He further explains that the exchange rate is a critical variable to network health as long as hardware, electric power, and bandwidth are priced in fiat currency. Jorge disagrees with Harding's views and believes that Satoshi's timetable for transitioning to fee incentives can be tossed aside and replaced with something better. However, communication between the two seems to be inefficient, possibly due to English not being Jorge's native language. Regardless, Jorge does not want to waste any more time in the unproductive discussion. Harding ends the email with a newly-invented English saying: "A bunch of geniuses can do a lot more damage than one fool."</p>
