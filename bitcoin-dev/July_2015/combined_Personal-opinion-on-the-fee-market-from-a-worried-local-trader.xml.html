        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Valentin, a local Bitcoin trader and computer engineer, believes that a fee market should be allowed to form in the Bitcoin network. He argues against the idea that higher fees would scare away Bitcoin users, stating that if some users leave, demand for bitcoin transactions would go down and so would the fees. Valentin believes that the fee market would find an equilibrium between the demand for bitcoin transactions and the available supply, given by the block size. In the absence of a functioning fee market, Valentin believes that spammers, gamblers, and people transacting very low amounts would likely be the first to leave, while those who actually need Bitcoin would remain. He strongly expresses his opinion that he will refuse to run Bitcoin code that increases the block size and will do his best to tell everyone not to upgrade towards running such code. If Bitcoin succumbs to the free stuff army, he will sell all his coins and leave. Valentin acknowledges that he may have exaggerated but emphasizes that nothing is for free, and he has a reasonable understanding of free markets. Currently, he runs only one full node.</p>
