    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>CPFP, or Child Pays for Parent, is a policy that incentivizes miners to include low-fee transactions in a block by allowing them to also include high-fee transactions that depend on the low-fee ones. However, CPFP does not completely solve the problem of insufficient fees. If a transaction goes out without sufficient fee, sending out a new transaction will not suddenly allow it to reach nodes/miners that previously ignored it. Richard Moore, founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc., brought up the topic of CPFP and its feasibility as a default policy in an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 10, 2015. He also questioned whether the transaction fee should be based on the total size of all transactions or the sum of each individual transaction's required fee. Moore even attempted to test CPFP by sending a transaction with no fee, followed by another transaction with a small fee, but it still did not confirm. The lack of confirmation could be due to several factors, such as insufficient hash power, too small amounts, new coins, or congestion.</p>
