    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>If the timeout is increased for non-SPV mining, miners will get variable payouts based on how long since the last block was received. Also, if some miners change their output based on the fees offered by pools, then as time passes, the hashing rate would increase, and the variation in block-to-block times would reduce. There could be a situation where adding a few more transactions to the memory pool of a coin would cause a 100X increasing hashing until the block is found and then stalling again as the hashing power switches away. If hashing isn't constantly applied, then the inter-block times will expand, the difficulty will reduce, and a pool that decides to use all its available hashing 100% of the time now has an advantage over those who are playing nicely. If there were always useful fees available to mine immediately after a block is found, then everyone would keep mining, and the incentives to try to deliberately orphan the last block are reduced.</p>
