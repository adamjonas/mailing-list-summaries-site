    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>less than 1 Mbps) were excluded.Â * The maximum throughput of each node was recorded by sending it a large number of transactions and measuring the time it took to process them.The results showed that the Bitcoin network can support larger blocks than the current 1MB limit. The average maximum throughput of the surveyed nodes was 27 transactions per second, which corresponds to a block size of 2.1MB. Even nodes with slower connection speeds were able to handle blocks up to 4MB in size without any issues. These findings suggest that increasing the block size limit could significantly increase the transaction capacity of the Bitcoin network.However, it is important to note that this study only looked at the technical feasibility of larger blocks and did not consider other factors such as decentralization, security, and economic incentives. Any changes to the block size limit would need to be carefully evaluated and implemented in a way that maintains the integrity of the Bitcoin network.Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the capabilities of the Bitcoin network and highlights the potential for future improvements in transaction processing.</p>
