    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in July 2015, it was noted that even large companies with $30 million USD of funding did not run a single Bitcoin Core node that is open to incoming connections. However, it was pointed out that many companies may still be reluctant to accept incoming connections from the internet due to security concerns. It was suggested that these companies likely still have nodes, but they are not accessible externally.</p>
