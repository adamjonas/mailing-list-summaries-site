    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context highlights the importance of measuring risk in a systematic way against known metrics instead of taking cheap shots at vendors to garner consulting revenue. The writer suggests that tweeting, blogging, and drama are generally counterproductive. However, when the issue is raised, most developers shun the idea due to their lack of maturity and experience. As a result, there is a lot of teenage nonsense where people call each other "trolls" on Reddit instead of engaging in real risk analysis.The context also talks about Todd's habit of creating drama on Twitter and Reddit every time anyone wants to change something in Bitcoin in a way he doesn't like. This behavior is driving away vendors. The writer further mentions that Todd openly commented on a female developer's cleavage on Twitter and referred to a female journalist as "naughty," which is disgusting. Additionally, his constant hitting on women developers in Bitcoin is driving away females.The Twitter account of Todd has been provided for reference, but it comes with a warning of being triggering. Finally, Mike Hearn has mentioned how Todd's behavior is causing harm to the community.</p>
