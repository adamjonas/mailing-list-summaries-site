    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread on July 28, 2015, Eric Lombrozo raised a point about transaction fees. He stated that no fee market had been created and it was unknown how transaction fees would work in practice. Lombrozo believed that the only way to see how fees would work in practice was to have scarcity. However, Thomas Zander, another member of the thread, questioned why there was a need for a fees market. Zander argued that there was no reason to plan that far ahead as there is no need for a fees market for the next 10 to 20 years to incentivize miners to mine.</p>
