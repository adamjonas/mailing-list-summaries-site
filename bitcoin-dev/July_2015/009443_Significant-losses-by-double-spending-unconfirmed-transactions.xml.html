    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Arne reached out to the bitcoin-dev community for clarification on pre- and post-Hearn-relay drop rules. They were curious if these rules have anything to do with the minrelaytxfee setting proposed in the 0.11.0 release notes and whether there's a code change related to this that they missed. Additionally, they wanted to know if there's a chart that plots estimatefee over time to see how the fee market evolved over the past weeks. In response to Arne's query, simongreen--- via bitcoin-dev shared their recent experience performing double-spend attacks against zeroconf accepting merchants. They provided examples of successful transactions using tx1 and tx2, where miners did not accept dust/low-fee/reused-address/large-size/etc. outputs. They also claimed that F2Pool, Eligius, BTCChina, AntPool, etc. are all miners who have reverted Hearn's 10x relay fee drop as recommended by v0.11.0 release notes and accept these double-spends. Shapeshift.io lost around 3BTC this week in multiple transactions and is no longer accepting zeroconf. Furthermore, simongreen--- mentioned their surprise that Reddit didn't cancel the "fools-gold" after tx reversal, as they had bought a silly amount of reddit gold off Coinbase in this manner among other things. They also found multiple Bitcoin ATMs vulnerable to this attack. In summary, every target depending on zeroconf lost significant sums of money with high probability. Finally, simongreen--- warned users to listen to the experts and stop relying on zeroconf while advising black hats to profit.</p>
