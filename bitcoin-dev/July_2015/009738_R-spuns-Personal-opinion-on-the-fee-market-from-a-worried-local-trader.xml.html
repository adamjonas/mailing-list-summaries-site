    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this email thread revolves around the fee market and the implications of an unlimited block size. One member emphasizes that Bitcoin must remain competitive with other payment methods, and users should be able to transact quickly and cheaply. They argue that a fee market is necessary but small transactions should still be possible without facing absurd fees. Another member argues that if a fee market prices out certain categories of users, they will be free to use any altcoin they want. However, this member is criticized for suggesting that gamblers and people transacting low amounts don't actually need Bitcoin. The email thread highlights the importance of finding a balance between the demand for Bitcoin transactions and the available supply, and the potential consequences of not doing so, including a bleed of value from Bitcoin to alternative blockchains.</p>
