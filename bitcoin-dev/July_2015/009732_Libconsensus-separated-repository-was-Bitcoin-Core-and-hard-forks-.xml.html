    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 28th July 2015, Jorge Timon asked a question on prioritizing VerifyTx vs VerifyHeader. He also inquired about step-checks functions worth exposing. There was a discussion on independent libconsensus project which is different from future-libconsensus and Bitcoin Core developmentâ€™s privileged position in deciding consensus rules changes. The lack of isolation, the fact that the satoshi client wouldn't actually use the library, and backtracking to use OpenSSL were mentioned as issues with the library. However, these are now non-issues. It was also stated that nobody has control over this process, there will be multiple consensus implementations targeting the same coin, and isolating the satoshi consensus checks to an independent library serves not to eliminate that risk but can reduce it somewhat. Finally, it was mentioned that the fear of consensus bugs is not what keeps people on the satoshi client and that other issues are more significant to the adoption of libbitcoin-server than this one.</p>
