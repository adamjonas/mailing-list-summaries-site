    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin developers have proposed four block size BIPs including BIP100, BIP101, BIP102, and BIP103. These proposals aim to facilitate further discussion on the initiation of hardfork. It is suggested that a miner voting mechanism should be used for initiating the hardfork while BIP102 and BIP103 do not support this idea. The initiation date for hardfork differs in each proposal with BIP100 proposing 2016-01-11, BIP101 suggesting two weeks after 75% miner support, but not before 2016-01-11, BIP102 proposing 2015-11-11, and BIP103 suggesting 2017-01-01. The block size at initiation also varies among these proposals with BIP100 proposing 1MB, BIP101 suggesting 8MB, BIP102 proposing 2MB, and BIP103 suggesting 1MB. Further increase or decrease in block size is allowed only by miner voting in BIP100 and BIP103 while BIP101 suggests doubling every 2 years with linear interpolations in between (41.4% p.a.) and BIP102 does not allow any such increase or decrease. The earliest date for a >=2MB block is suggested as 2016-04-03 in BIP100, 2016-01-11 in BIP101, 2015-11-11 in BIP102, and 2020-12-27 in BIP103. The final block size is suggested as 32MB in BIP100, 8192MB in BIP101, 2MB in BIP102, and 2048MB in BIP103. The final block size can be decided by miners according to BIP100, while BIP101 suggests 2036-01-06, BIP102 suggests 2015-11-11, and BIP103 suggests 2063-07-09.</p>
