    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Justus Ranvier and an unknown recipient on July 4, 2015, the question of how to determine if a committed UTXO set is valid was raised. The recipient suggested that proving the UTXO tree root before and after each transaction is committed would be a way to verify its correctness. Furthermore, merkle paths can be included to prove the transformation. Additionally, it was mentioned that short proofs for each step may be possible as long as they are provable and sorted. However, ensuring that everything required to validate a block has been proven is necessary.</p>
