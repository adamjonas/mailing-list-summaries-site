    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The thread discusses the ability for users to decide their own consensus parameters at runtime, which is already being implemented through a config file or by forking the codebase and implementing changes. It is noted that this alternative would be more about lobbying and coalitions rather than pull requests. The developers propose a new version by publishing a new release and the individual network nodes choose to accept or reject it. Bitcoin Core is running the Bitcoin economy and its developers have the authority to set its rules, enforced due to ~100% market share and limited GitHub commit access. Refusal to make a release with different rules leaves people with only two options: swallow it or fork the project and block chain with it (XT). This situation may anger those who object to either option. One user notes having worked on something similar in the past, suggesting the need for a new genesis block, different magic bytes, and a different network port at the very least.</p>
