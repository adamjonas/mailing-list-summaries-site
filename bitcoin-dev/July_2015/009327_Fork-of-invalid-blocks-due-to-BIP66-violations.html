    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 3, 2015, Raystonn expressed surprise that BitcoinJ does not implement any of the soft-fork codes. Gregory Maxwell suggested that SPV clients should check node versions against the minimum required for safety and this check should be upgraded when new BIPs go into effect. He also noted that a near majority of the network's hashrate appears to be SPV mining and that btcnuggets was a non-upgraded miner that produced an invalid block after the lock-in while f2pool and antpool have been extending it. Luckily, their extension contains no transactions due to SPV mining. A complete understanding of the situation will take some time and the failure mode was one that they were aware of, which is why the threshold is so high.</p>
