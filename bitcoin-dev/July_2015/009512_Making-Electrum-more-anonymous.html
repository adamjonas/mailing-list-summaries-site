    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum, has proposed creating an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients. Currently Electrum clients connect to several servers to fetch block headers, but request address balances and histories from single servers, meaning that the chosen server knows that a given set of addresses belong to the same wallet â€“ even if Electrum is used over TOR. Various proposals have been made to improve this, including creating subsets of wallet addresses and sending them to separate servers, however, these proposals have not convinced Voegtlin because they require trusting more servers. The idea of creating an anonymous routing layer between Electrum servers and clients was inspired by TOR, and Voegtlin is seeking feedback on the proposal. One respondent noted that the Dissent protocol could be considered as it reduces the impact of Sybil attacks.</p>
