    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Mike Hearn and Jorge Timon on the topic of Bitcoin's block size, its effect on mining decentralization, and the potential impact on Bitcoin exchanges was discussed via email in 2015. Hearn argued that increasing the block size could bring more users and miners to the platform, while Timon suggested that larger blocks would not help improve centralization issues. They also discussed the arbitrary nature of the 8MB cap on the block size, and the need for a simulation to determine the optimal limit. While Hearn argued that the consensus block size limit is important for limiting centralization, Timon disagreed, stating that exchanges' potential for future profit should not be a primary concern when deciding on consensus rule changes that affect all users.</p>
