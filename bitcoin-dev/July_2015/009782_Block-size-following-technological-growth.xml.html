    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Adam Back, Andresen shared his opinion on the proposed increase of 2MB blocks in 2021. He believes that this is too conservative and could lead to the main blockchain becoming a settlement network only affordable for large-value transactions. However, Back questioned whether increasing throughput would compromise Bitcoin's already weak decentralization. Andresen suggested that they should focus on improving decentralization before borrowing from it to create more throughput. Additionally, he argues that lightning will likely be online by 2021 and thus an incremental and conservative approach is safer. The conversation ended with Andresen stating that trading off decentralization for throughput increases would be reasonable if decentralization was not in bad shape.</p>
