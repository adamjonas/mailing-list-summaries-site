    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A community member named Simon Green posted a message in the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list on July 14th, 2015. In his message, he mentioned that an unconfirmed transaction (tx1) was sent to a merchant with some issues such as dust, low fee, reused address and large size which may not always be accepted by miners. Later, someone commented on this message saying that although the demonstration was valuable, the txid's were not provided to prove that the transaction was actually made. The person also advised that for anyone relying on an unconfirmed transaction, it is important to pay a good fee and make sure that it is highly relayable/minable.</p>
