    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the context explains that their relationships are merely people who talk to them, ask for advice and warn them about possible threats. They clarify that these relationships are not legal contracts. The writer then addresses concerns about their actions being perceived as attacking companies in hopes of landing consulting fees. They assume that if companies hire them as consultants or put them on advisory boards, they would stop badmouthing them. The text points out that developer attacks can be a high-risk issue due to the small number of developers with authority from the github gatekeeper and the lack of an incentive system for Bitcoin developers. The writer suggests implementing a systematic risk analysis to reduce the probability of such an attack. This would allow issues to be judged against a standard instead of developers making claims haphazardly on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and blog posts, which create drama and confusion.</p>
