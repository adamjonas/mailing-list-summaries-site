    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the authority of Bitcoin Core developers. Mike Hearn argues that they run the Bitcoin economy and have the power to set rules, while others suggest that consensus is measured by user actions after software release and that the network will let developers know if they fail to reflect user consensus. Cory Fields suggests adding the ability for the user to decide what their consensus parameters should be at runtime, which would be no different than suggesting that someone fork the codebase and implement their own changes. Eric Lombrozo provides a link to something similar he worked on in the past, and suggests requiring a new genesis block, different magic bytes, and a different network port at the very least. Raystonn notes that if developers discourage anything that forks from the rules enforced by Bitcoin Core, they harm the network's ability to inform us of a failure to reflect user consensus. The discussion continues with various perspectives on the role of Bitcoin Core developers and the possibility of allowing users to set their own consensus parameters.</p>
