    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 29, 2015, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the profitability of miners who do not validate transactions. Gregory Maxwell and Mike Hearn had differing viewpoints on the matter. Maxwell argued that miners who do not validate transactions will end up losing money, while Hearn claimed that those engaging in such activities have found it to be profitable, despite any losses they may incur. The discussion was buried in another thread, so Maxwell reposted it to gather more insight. He proposed that measuring and publishing the effects of such activities could establish credibility in the system design or trigger a conversation on what needs fixing. If there is no known data available, Maxwell suggested that someone new to Bitcoin interested in researching this topic should start by finding a good place to begin.</p>
