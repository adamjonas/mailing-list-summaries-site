    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the assumption that an unlimited block size would eliminate the fee market. If 75% of hashing power accepts "medium" fee transactions while the remaining 25% is willing to accept low (or any) fees, then a user paying a lower fee has approximately a 75% chance that their transaction won't be included in the next block. Users who desire the most reliably fast confirmations are better off paying the minimum fee that a majority of miners will accept. Miners breaking ranks and accepting lower fees only affects users who aren't sufficiently interested in quicker confirmations. As long as a majority of miners "collude," they will likely keep the average fees higher than miners with lower costs of operation might be willing to accept. Regarding the assumption, Adam Back suggested that it wouldn't work because any miner can break ranks and set their own minimum accepted fee or transaction acceptance algorithm, doing so profitably. To expect otherwise is to expect oligopoly behavior, which is the antithesis of a decentralized mining system. Therefore, decentralization of mining provides policy neutrality as some miner somewhere with some hash rate will process the transaction even if other miners are by policy deciding not to mine it. It is the same reason why free transactions are processed today, policies vary, and this is good for ensuring various types of transactions get processed.</p>
