    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation between Mike Hearn and Thomas Voegtlin, they discuss the integration of DNSSEC with BIP70. Mike suggests that Thomas could work with Netki, a company that is also working on DNSSEC integration with BIP70. However, Thomas expresses uncertainty about Netki's open-source implementation. They also discuss the flaw in email certificates and propose an alternative way to sign BIP70 requests that relies on neither email nor certificate authorities. Mike argues that existing infrastructure has everything in place to solve the issue of hacked email accounts. Despite this, Thomas remains skeptical and believes that BIP70 wallets need to integrate with <a href="https://crt.sh">https://crt.sh</a> and convince all CAs to report all email certs they issue to crt.sh. They both agree that the solution for email certificates is solving yesterday's problems, thus concluding their conversation.</p>
