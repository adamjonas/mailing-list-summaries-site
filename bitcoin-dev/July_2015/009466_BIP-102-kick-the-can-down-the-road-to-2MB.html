    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 17, 2015, Jeff Garzik expressed concern over miners bumping their soft limit to 1 MB prematurely. He emphasized that the only reason block size limit lifting is remotely reasonable is if miners can keep their soft limits set at a manageable size. Garzik proposed moving the activation date further in the future, maybe November 2016 or 2017, and increasing the block size limit by 15% instead of doubling it. He suggested getting a commitment from miners not to move their soft limits beyond 1 MB until some future-agreed-on point.In response, Tier Nolan stated that hard forks are not something where voting makes sense, since they need consensus among nodes, not majority among miners. Nolan added that no hard fork has ever had such a vote.</p>
