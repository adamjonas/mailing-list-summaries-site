    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, the former lead developer of Bitcoin, expressed his opinion on a proposal to introduce shorter ECDSA keys to save space for public key and signature. He stated that introducing a new address type would require a lot of people to change their code, which was learned from the introduction of P2SH addresses. Gavin also added that it is not worth it for a modest space savings of ~5% with all overhead counted, especially with the extreme decrease in security going from 2^160 to 2^80 to brute-force. If this happens, he thinks it will be part of the OP_MAST that requires a new address type anyway. Therefore, Gavin believes that a better way to save space is to introduce shorter ECDSA keys, which would be safe as long as the output value is much lower than the cost of attack.</p>
