    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Pieter Wuille stated that it would be dangerous for the network and its users to risk forks or push dramatic changes. However, Tom Harding disagreed, stating that allowing bitcoin to become space-constrained without technical reason is a dramatic change. He criticized the reasons cited in support of this view, including what he called "vaporware," amateurish economic thinking surrounding fees, and an infinite descent of not supporting something because not everyone supports it. Harding also noted that all real-world computers are space-constrained.</p>
