    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin developers' email thread, Jameson Lopp raised concerns about the cost of running a node and maintaining decentralization in the face of increasing block sizes. Although there are advocates who argue that Bitcoin should keep it feasible for the average user to run their own node, there is no established baseline for the acceptable performance or hardware cost requirements to do so. Lopp called for clarification from these advocates around the acceptable cost of running a node and how to measure the global reduction in hardware and bandwidth costs to establish a baseline that can be used to justify additional resource usage by nodes. One developer responded that without any common notion of what the "minimal target hardware" looks like, it is difficult to discuss other things that depend on that. They suggested formalizing such minimum hardware requirements to ensure that a hard fork to increase block size would not be controversial if it can be shown that even a low-cost device with a 1 MB connection is viable as a full node.</p>
