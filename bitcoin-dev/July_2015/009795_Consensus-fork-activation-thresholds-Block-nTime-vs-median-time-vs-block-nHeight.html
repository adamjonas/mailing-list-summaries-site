    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen believes that using the version and timestamp fields in the block header is the simplest and best way to validate blocks. This method has several advantages such as being available to SPV nodes with no change to the network protocol, being available after headers downloaded, before full block data is available, and allowing all block validation except validation against the UTXO to happen in parallel, out-of-order, independent of any other block. However, it has a disadvantage of not being monotonically increasing. Andresen thinks that discussion about transactions in the memory pool is just a distraction and a blockchain re-organization could mean the validity of transactions you've accepted into the memory pool must be re-evaluated. He doesn't strongly care if median time or block timestamp is used, he thinks either will work. However, he does not like height as there are too many cases where the time is known but the block height isn't.</p>
