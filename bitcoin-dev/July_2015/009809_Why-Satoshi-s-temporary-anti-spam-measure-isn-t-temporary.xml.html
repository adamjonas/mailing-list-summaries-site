    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is currently researching decentralization and ways to measure it, particularly in relation to Bitcoin. They have taken over a website called BitcoinStandards.com and are considering using it as a platform to share their findings.  In an email conversation, Raystonn encourages the writer to create a list of metrics which would add value to the discussion. Milly Bitcoin has also weighed in on the topic, suggesting a risk analysis of the current system, mitigation strategies for each risk, a set of goals, and a roadmap detailing changes or possible avenues to achieve those goals. Proposed changes would be measured against the same metrics and a risk analysis done so it can be compared with the baseline. One of the metrics suggested by Milly Bitcoin is a decentralization metric which would include cost as one aspect. A framework for a decentralization metric is available at <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/stm103%20articles/Schneider_Decentralization.pdf">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/stm103%20articles/Schneider_Decentralization.pdf</a>.</p>
