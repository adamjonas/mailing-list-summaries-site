    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) nn by Dan Bryant is a draft that could add functionality to the Bitcoin-Core reference implementation and also add flexibility into any future fee schedules. The enhancement addresses the need of incentive inclusion of unconfirmed transactions, which creates new high fee transactions (or bounty) that spend the desired unconfirmed transactions. This BIP could be highly desirable for merchants who may have little control over the type of wallets their customers use. The specification of this BIP would have two implementations; an automatic sweep of incoming unconfirmed transaction setting, and a manual sweep of unconfirmed transaction setting. Both would have the ability to set the fee amount the user would like to pay for the sweep. The automatic sweep configuration may be ideal for merchants who want to ensure that their incoming transactions are not skipped over by miners. The manual sweep of incoming unconfirmed transactions would be a special type of "Send" in the current reference implementation. A manual sweep would auto-fill a send transaction with all currently unconfirmed incoming transactions in the mempool.This BIP allows people to offer a bounty for transactions that are incoming. As a safeguard to paying a bounty for small "dust" transactions, a minimum btc-threshold would be required for any automatic configuration. Wallet software that does not support this BIP will continue to operate without modification.</p>
