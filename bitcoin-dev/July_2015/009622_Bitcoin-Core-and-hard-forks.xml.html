    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2015, Jean-Paul Kogelman proposed that quality of service (QoS) tools should be added for miners to develop a more fair fee market. He suggested that miners could set different values for X, Y, and Z satoshi/kb to determine which transactions would be included in blocks. If miners start setting different values and adding more transactions to blocks as opposed to other miners with higher settings, a healthy fee market could develop. Kogelman argued that a block size cap would interfere with such a QoS scheme because miners wouldn't be able to deliver the guarantees if they have to start excluding transactions. Eric Lombrozo questioned what Kogelman meant by QoS, to which Kogelman responded that it referred to including transactions in different tiers based on their fees. He also stated that extending the cap (when possible) and adding better QoS tools for miners would create a fee market.</p>
