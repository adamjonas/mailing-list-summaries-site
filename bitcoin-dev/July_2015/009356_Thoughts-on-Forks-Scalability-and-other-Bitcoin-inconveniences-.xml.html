    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Eric Lombrozo and Justus Ranvier are discussing the security issues related to Bitcoin. Lombrozo mentions that he has implemented an entire SPV stack from scratch and suggests that looking into his work might change Ranvier's perspective. However, Ranvier expresses concern over the idea that "the raison d'etre of bitcoin is trustlessness" as it implies infinite security, which has never been the case. According to him, it is not possible to have a perfect standard of security achievable. He believes that striving for perfection can hinder progress towards achieving good security measures. Ranvier is associated with the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project.</p>
