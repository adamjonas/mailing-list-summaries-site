        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>BIP0074 is a draft proposal that aims to make Bitcoin payments at physical shop locations simpler. Currently, merchants require an app to calculate the amount of bitcoins that a customer needs to pay for their purchase. This creates difficulties if employees are not trained on the app or if the owner is not present. The proposal allows the merchant to specify which exchange rates they are using, allowing customers to look up the rates and pay accordingly. This could prove beneficial to businesses that do not get enough Bitcoin business to warrant training sessions or hardware dedicated to running the app.The proposal can be accessed through the GitHub link provided, though it should be noted that it is a draft proposal and may be subject to changes. However, using arbitrary BIP numbers was not recommended in the discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, especially if they were close or similar to those already assigned. David Barnes of Bitcoin Co. Ltd. had picked up the next available number for his proposed file but stated that the number was unimportant to the proposal and could be changed to anything. Micha Bailey questioned whether Greg had assigned the number. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and is used for technical discussions related to the development of the Bitcoin software. The proposal assumes that the merchant will receive an SMS notification that payment has been completed and the amount of payment in fiat currency. There are also services that provide SMS notifications upon Bitcoin transactions to a specific address. The proposal also suggests that requesting dollar amounts from customers leads to problems, but with their service, the merchant will receive an SMS that payment has been completed and the amount of payment (in the fiat currency).Finally, the proposal aims to simplify the process of accepting Bitcoin payments for merchants who do not have extensive training or expensive hardware. It also addresses the issue of discrepancies between what the customer thinks the exchange rate should be and what the merchant thinks it should be. Additionally, Bitcoin payment notification services via SMS are available for cashiers without Bitcoin apps or internet access. However, there is a concern about how they can verify successful payment if both they and the customer need to scan a new QR code. Staff members can easily forget how to use the apps/internet, even with training, if they don't see a Bitcoin customer for several weeks. This conclusion is based on first-hand experience and feedback from Bitcoin customers and merchants.</p>
