    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mark Friedenbach suggests that a decentralized system like bitcoin can scale through distribution with minimal trust, but requires changes to Bitcoin consensus rules. Thomas Zander proposes a simpler solution where miners use a CPU in a well-connected data center and connect to it over RPC to get a "block 000f00" accepted signal. The miner continues to use their current setup with actual validation of the blocks to eliminate the risk of mining on orphaned blocks and remove most of the cost of larger-than-average bandwidth. A slightly more complicated solution would allow the miner to only send the headers to the bitcoind instance, and if the risk of duplication becomes an issue, multiple propagating nodes could be set up on different sides of the world. Zander concludes that innovation for making things better for miners should be done in miner-specific software rather than end-user software like Bitcoin Core.</p>
