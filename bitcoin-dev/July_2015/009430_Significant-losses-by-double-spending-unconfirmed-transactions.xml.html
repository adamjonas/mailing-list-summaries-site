    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The current situation highlights the need for a systematic risk analysis as developers are making hyperbolic and demonizing statements about users being spammers and engaging in Sybil attacks. This is not a systematic analysis but rather a process similar to the Salem Witch trials. The use of the word "spammers" and "Sybil attacks" is not sufficient evidence for such characterizations. In fact, if this process continues, these statements can be considered "developer attacks" from an incentive-lacking developer system that is full of conflicts of interest. Furthermore, developers must connect to a large percentage of nodes on the network, which can be considered a sybil attack. If more than a few services were doing this, the Bitcoin network would become significantly less reliable and could eventually collapse. Additionally, spammers are using up fullnode resources, which is highly disrespectful. Overall, it is important to conduct a detailed systematic risk analysis to avoid making baseless statements and to ensure the reliability and scalability of the Bitcoin network.</p>
