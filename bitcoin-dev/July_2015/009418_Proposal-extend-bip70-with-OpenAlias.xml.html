    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Netki has released an open source solution for blockchain-based name resolution, which includes an open lookup standard based on both the Namecoin blockchain as well as traditional DNSSEC. The system allows users to choose between namecoin-based names or ICANN names. Netki intends to work with companies that wish to host their own names and is also in discussions with Verisign over merging standards. While OpenAlias supports similar functionality, Netki has made a few differences, including not using DNSCrypt due to concerns over interoperability and achieving privacy using HD Wallets and Payment Requests. Netki also allows for storing a URL rather than just a wallet address in the TXT record, and provides a two-tier lookup format. It mandates DNSSEC while OpenAlias makes it optional, but OpenAlias has a soft fail for DNSSEC, requiring user confirmation of the address.</p>
