    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille proposed a plan to increase the maximum block size of Bitcoin from 1MB to 2MB. This proposal was met with comments from Gavin Andresen, who thanked Pieter for making a concrete proposal and provided specific comments on the proposal. Andresen thought that waiting until 2021 to reach 2MB blocks was too conservative and would lead to the main blockchain becoming a settlement network only affordable for large transactions. He also believed that the proposal did not strike the right balance between centralization of payments and mining. Andresen asked about the importance of monotonically increasing when it comes to the maximum block size and stated that he would comment on using median time generally in another thread.</p>
