        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email conversation between Vali Zero and Angel Leon, posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, centered around the establishment of a fee market for Bitcoin transactions. Vali Zero argued that a fee market would weed out spammers and gamblers while ensuring people who actually need Bitcoin will continue to use it, with others switching to altcoins. He also stated that in the absence of a functioning fee market, he will refuse to run Bitcoin code that increases the block size. However, Angel Leon disagreed, stating everyone should have the freedom to use Bitcoin irrespective of their transaction amounts or purposes. He argued that Bitcoin needs to increase its block size to cater to the increasing number of users, and if Bitcoin becomes useless, it's worthless. Vali Zero explained that a fee market would bleed value from Bitcoin, giving it to alternative blockchains as people will exchange for something that allows them to transact with lesser fees, then make the desired payment. He also noted that anyone thinking the fee market can be restrained to Bitcoin alone is mistaken. Both parties agree that the fee market will affect the usage of Bitcoin, but they differ in their opinions on how it should be managed. Vali Zero is a local Bitcoin trader and computer engineer who has a reasonable understanding of free markets, running only one full node. In contrast, Angel Leon is a person who values financial freedom and decentralization in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
