        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell initially messaged Mark, stating that the code in BIP 68 compared the input's nSequence with the transaction's nLockTime. However, Rusty later admitted that he had misinterpreted the code and acknowledged his mistake. Mark promptly clarified the situation to Rusty offlist and assured him that the code was working correctly. In response, Rusty expressed his gratitude to Mark for the clarification and conveyed his satisfaction about the proper functioning of the code.The code in question pertains to BIP 68, which involves comparing the nSequence of the input with the nLockTime of the transaction. In cases where a transaction spends the output of another transaction already present in the blockchain, there is no need for a relative locktime. This is because the time of the previous transaction is already known. However, if the transaction is not yet included in the blockchain, its creation becomes problematic as the value required to set nLockTime remains unknown. Considering this predicament, Rusty sought clarification on how the functionality was intended to work.</p>
