    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is a response to an inquiry about the situation where a group of miners suddenly switch their support, for example not intending to back new rules. The writer suggests that miners may be economically rational and will switch if there is a large decrease in difficulty on the original chain without a corresponding decrease in token value. The message cautions against assuming that all miners will continue to support the side they initially signaled, as they are only invested in the chain they mine for a short time until coinbase maturity. If both sides of a fork retain value, mining will redistribute itself in terms of short term profitability at every difficulty adjustment, regardless of initial signaled support for the fork. The message is signed with PGP signature version APG v1.1.1 and contains an email address of the writer.</p>
