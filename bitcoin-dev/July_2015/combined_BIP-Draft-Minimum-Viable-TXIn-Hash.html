        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been proposed to reduce the amount of bytes needed per transaction, which can be implemented through a soft fork. The BIP is in its early stages, and there are many design options available for this type of improvement. The proposed improvements show a reduction of around 12% for standard "one in two out" transactions and even more with additional input hashes. The draft can be viewed on GitHub.On July 23, 2015, Jeremy Rubin proposed a draft BIP that could reduce the number of bytes needed per transaction. The proposal was intended to be a soft fork and had the potential to decrease transaction sizes by around 12% for standard "one in two out" transactions and even more for those with multiple input hashes. Luke suggested that the protocol changes need to be documented more specifically, but noted that it appears to be a peer-to-peer protocol optimization that does not require a soft fork.The discussion revolves around the proposed implementation of a consensus change to allow confirmed transactions to use less space in blocks, which could be rolled out as a hard fork. A cultural analogy, the "Txid Hokey Pokey," was used to explain the technical process, but some found it confusing and requested a more neutral explanation. Some suggest that the proposed protocol changes might not require a soft fork, and there is uncertainty about how the "compact tx" would produce a different hash than the non-compact one.</p>
