    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange between Mike Hearn and Gregory Maxwell, Hearn accuses Maxwell of misrepresenting the intentions of Satoshi Nakamoto regarding the scalability of Bitcoin. Hearn claims that it was always understood that users would want to limit the size of the blockchain to keep it verifiable on small devices. However, Maxwell argues that this is a recent invention by Hearn and that Satoshi's original vision was for Bitcoin to be used by specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. Maxwell also defends his position on the use of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as Satoshi intended, while Hearn accuses him of ignoring problems in the mining ecosystem. The conversation becomes increasingly heated, with Hearn accusing Maxwell of trying to convert Bitcoin into an altcoin by exploiting a temporary hack and upsetting many people. Hearn concludes by suggesting that Maxwell create his own altcoin if he wants to enforce a social contract that limits Bitcoin's capacity.</p>
