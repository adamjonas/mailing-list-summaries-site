    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is currently running a full node with Peter Todd's full replace-by-fee patch set and is observing many messages in the log about replacement transactions being rejected due to them paying less in fees than the transactions they would replace. This could happen legitimately from time to time, but due to the ongoing spam attack, the writer is seeing a steady stream of these rejection messages, sometimes dozens per second. The writer is wondering if each replacement rejection ought to penalize the peer who relayed the offending transaction and if the penalty builds up enough, then the peer could be temporarily banned. The link provided leads to the Github repository for Peter Todd's replace-by-fee patch set.</p>
