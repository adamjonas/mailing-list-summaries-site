    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Lombrozo expressed concerns about the failure of the network if those who provide computational resources are not properly incentivized. However, this assumption is proven wrong by history as seen in the examples of RC5 challenge, folding-at-home, and seti-at-home. Additionally, running a node provides an incentive for individuals and businesses as they do not have to trust someone else. It is too early to call failure on running nodes, and instead, efforts should be made to help merchants, chains, and individuals run them by making bitcoin-core more useful for them. The reason people do not run nodes is due to upstream bandwidth not being able to be throttled, and this issue needs to be worked on instead of giving up.</p>
