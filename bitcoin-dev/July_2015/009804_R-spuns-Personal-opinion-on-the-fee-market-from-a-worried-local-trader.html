    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Tom Harding and Jorge Timón, they debated the necessity of a block size limit in creating a functioning fee market. While Adam Back believed that the block size limit was necessary, Timón argued that it was not. Timón believed that hitting the limit would only cause higher fees and not cause bitcoin to fail. Harding agreed that Timón had made a great step forward in the debate by acknowledging that a block size limit was not needed for a functioning fee market. Harding then discussed how miners do not care about transactions or fees, rather they only care about the subsidy. This is why some miners treat one satoshi fees and no fees as the same. Harding also noted that he was worried about excessive mining subsidies and that "hitting the limit" could motivate miners to start caring more about transactions and fees. He did not see rising non-fast-confirmation mining fees above zero as a bad thing. The discussion then shifted towards the issue of decentralization. Harding acknowledged that there is no defined measurable unit for decentralization, but suggested that pool percentages, number of nodes, and subsidy/fee ratio could be used as metrics. He stated that it is possible that decentralization(blocksize) = decentralization(blocksize+1), but the burden of proof is on those who propose increasing the block size. Finally, Harding argued that expensive proof of work must be paid for, and that fees will eventually become necessary.</p>
