    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion, Ryan Butler inquires whether an unlimited block size implies the lack of a fee market. Adam Back responds that miners can set their minimum accepted fees or transaction acceptance algorithms, but it is unlikely to work because any miner can break ranks and do so profitably. This expectation is contrary to a decentralized mining system that ensures policy neutrality. Anonymous mining feature also ensures policy neutrality and makes oligopoly or cartel behavior unstable. Miners can process transactions others wish to block or with lower fees than a cartel would like to charge without detection. However, this is all overlaid by the 51% attack, which could be avoided partly by mining decentralization. Any coherent cartel that arises and maintains 51% and has enough self-interest to make it stable could attack miners bypassing their cartel policies by orphaning their blocks. This overt act is detectable and could lead to technical counter-measures by the users who are ultimately in control of the protocol. Therefore, there is some game theory suggesting miners should not be overt in cartel attacks. Non-overt attacks cannot prevent anonymous undercutting of cartel desired fee minimums.</p>
