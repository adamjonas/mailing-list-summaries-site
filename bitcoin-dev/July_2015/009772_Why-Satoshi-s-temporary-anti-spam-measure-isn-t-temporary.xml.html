    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille discuss scalability road map for Bitcoin. Pieter suggests waiting for Blockstream Elements to be ready before hard fork, while Gavin believes hard forks should be implemented as soon as possible to set a precedent that they are possible in Bitcoin. Lightning doesn't require Segregated Witnesses, but op_maturity/rcltv/scv are needed for fully p2p Bitcoin sidechain. Gavin thinks lightning should be possible in Bitcoin main as soon as possible. Older payment channel designs (different from lightning) that don't even require cltv are suggested as less risky than a hardfork. Both scaling up what we already have and understanding new technology can be worked on simultaneously.</p>
