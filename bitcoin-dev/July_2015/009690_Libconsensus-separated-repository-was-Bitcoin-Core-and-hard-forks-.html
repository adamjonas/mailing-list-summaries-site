    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list between Jorge Tim√≥n and Eric Voskuil revolves around the need for an independent consensus library, which could be used by alternative implementations. While libbitcoin has already published and maintained bitcoind's "libbitcoinconsensus" source files as an independent C++ library, there are still some issues that need to be resolved before Bitcoin Core can consider using it directly. These include encapsulating consensus code so that it can be built without any script-related code, finishing libconsensus's API, and moving libconsensus to a separate repository as a subtree/subrepository of Bitcoin Core. Additionally, there is a need for competitive alternative implementations in order to reduce the "gatekeeping" friction around Bitcoin Core. Overall, the goal is to have a sufficiently modularized codebase that swapping out consensus rules is fairly straightforward and easy to test, thus reducing the risk of consensus fork bugs.</p>
