    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev in 2015, Eric Lombrozo argued for a modular codebase that allows for easy testing and swapping out of consensus rules. He pointed to the "libbitcoinconsensus" source files which had been published as an independent C++ library with Java and Python bindings by libbitcoin. The library could be easily verified against bitcoind sources and swapped out for libbitcoin's native consensus checks in builds of libbitcoin-blockchain. Lombrozo argued that there is no reason to consider the original client synonymous with consensus and that the community needs to move beyond a largely singular and monolithic codebase. To make choice regarding consensus an actual choice the modularity he suggested was essential, allowing one to take new developments without having to take consensus changes.</p>
