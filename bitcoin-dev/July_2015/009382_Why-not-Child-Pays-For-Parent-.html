    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Justus Ranvier on July 10, 2015, they talked about propagation thresholds and Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) that happen in Bitcoin transactions. Garzik explained that propagation has two thresholds - "-minrelaytxfee" and "relaypriority," which can be configured by miners to determine how and what they propagate. The priority of a transaction increases as it ages in the mempool, meaning even a low fee transaction can eventually become relayable based on relaypriority. Ranvier added that if the recipient is initiating CPFP, they must have a copy of the parent transaction to broadcast at the same time, and if the child reaches a CPFP miner, both transactions can be mined at the same time. However, it was unclear whether SPV clients rebroadcast both spend and receive transactions.</p>
