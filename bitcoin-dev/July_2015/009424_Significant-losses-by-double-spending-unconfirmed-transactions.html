    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Tom Harding questioned the legitimacy of Peter Todd's double-spending demonstration. Todd had failed to include the transaction ID's in his demonstration. However, Todd defended his demonstration by claiming that the transactions he used did have good fees and were highly relayable/minable. This was later confirmed by Shapeshift.io, who fell victim to the same attack. Shapeshift.io depends on Blockcypher's "confidence factor" model to estimate TX confirmation probability. However, this model does not take into account miners who use customized Bitcoin Core codebases that do not follow normal policies. As a result, Shapeshift.io is now disabling unconfirmed TX acceptance and has vowed to improve its system.</p>
