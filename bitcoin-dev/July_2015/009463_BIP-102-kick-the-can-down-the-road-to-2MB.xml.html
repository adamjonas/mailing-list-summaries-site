    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Ross expresses his support for a temporary solution of increasing the block size to 2MB while a permanent solution is being sought. He states that the current block size of 3 transactions per second is too small and does not provide enough space for the network to find an equilibrium between volume and pricing without becoming unusable. Ross suggests switching over by block height rather than time and proposes a minimum target of 6 months for testing virtually every wallet/node out there. Jeff Garzik opens a mailing list thread on BIP 173, which is a minimum viable alternative plan to his preferred proposal, BIP 100. The intent behind BIP 173 is to provide a known quantity as a backup plan if agreement is not reached on a more comprehensive solution. The benefits of BIP 173 are that it provides a conservative increase and allows for added growth while the community gathers data on how an increased block size impacts various metrics. However, BIP 173 requires a hard fork and another one down the road. Links to the BIP and code PR are provided in the message.</p>
