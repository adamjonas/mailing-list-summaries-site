    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about decentralized systems, Gavin Andresen suggests some examples of successful and unsuccessful ones. He mentions parallel compiling systems such as distcc, icecream, and teambuilder, and compares Git to subversion or perforce. Andresen also suggests Google's search system, specifically their filesystem and internal databases, as a potential example. He provides a link to the Wikipedia page for the Google File System as reference. Additionally, he brings up the idea that successful distributed systems are fractal-like, with islands that connect, like Bitcoin core does to some extent. However, he notes that its 'ping' score for connections is unreliable and not used to propagate smartly.</p>
