        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Danny Thorpe, a member of the Bitcoin development community, has discussed the deployment of an uncontroversial hard fork in Bitcoin's main chain with another member. He suggested that it be deployed in testnet3 first. The other member asked how big-block testnet nodes would recognize each other on the peer network. Danny explained that even though they share the same port and magic numbers, each testchain has a different genesis block, so they will reject blocks from any other testchain from the start. However, he said that nodes can be manually connected to get the desired network topology for testing purposes. To simplify the testing of different block sizes, a pull request has been created on Github. If merged, this pull request would also make future block size changes easier. The creator of the PR hopes that more people will test and simulate various consensus maximum block sizes. This would lead to a simplification in work. It is recommended that individuals do not discuss the block size issue itself in this post or the PR. One can use the branch (or a fork of it) for testing purposes. The listed dependencies include Chainparams: Translations and CTestNetParams and CRegTestParams extending directly from CChainParams. As things get merged, the list of dependencies will be updated accordingly. Danny Thorpe stated that he did not have time to write tests and simulations himself but encouraged others to do it and offered to answer any further questions.</p>
