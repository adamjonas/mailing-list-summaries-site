    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a previous post suggests that including proof in a request is unnecessary as the payer can download it independently, with only the final signature being needed. The author notes that what makes DNSSEC interesting is not the size of the proof, but rather the ease with which it can be requested and the canonical way in which it is provided. A commenter questions whether an EC signature can be used with DNSSEC, as they believed it to be an all-RSA system. If EC signatures are possible and only 32 bytes are needed, then the argument against including proof in a request does not hold.</p>
