        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent conversation within the Bitcoin development community, Danny Thorpe suggested deploying an uncontroversial hard fork in Bitcoin's main chain first in testnet3. Another member expressed gratitude for the suggestion and raised a question about how big-block testnet nodes would recognize each other on the peer network. Danny clarified that although these nodes share the same port and magic numbers, each testchain has a different genesis block, which means they will reject blocks from any other testchain right from the beginning. However, he mentioned that nodes can be manually connected to achieve the desired network topology for testing purposes. Danny also noted that he didn't have time to write tests and simulations himself but encouraged others to do so and offered to answer any further questions.On Github, a pull request has been created with the aim of simplifying the testing of different block sizes. If this pull request is merged, it would not only facilitate future block size changes but also encourage more people to test and simulate various consensus maximum block sizes. This, in turn, would simplify the overall work process. The creator of the pull request specifically requested that individuals refrain from discussing the block size issue itself in both the post and the pull request. The size itself is referred to as "-blocksize". Those interested can use the branch or a fork of it for testing purposes. The listed dependencies for this pull request include Chainparams: Translations, CTestNetParams, and CRegTestParams, all of which extend directly from CChainParams. As the pull request progresses and merges occur, the list of dependencies will be updated accordingly.</p>
