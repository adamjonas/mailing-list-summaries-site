    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between two individuals, Dan Bryant and another individual, they discuss a potential compromise for transactions that don't have enough fees for P2P transfer to stay in 'deadmans land'. They agree that a lot of the functionality could be achieved by a system that works in most cases. The current system only adds a transaction into the memory pool if it meets the relay threshold and spends transactions that are either in the memory pool or in a block. There is also an orphan pool that can store up to 100 orphans. To enable child pays for parent, a node could remember the last 100 transactions (up to 5000 bytes) that were rejected from the memory pool due to insufficient relay fees. This allows nodes to send a chain of transactions in a row. If the child is sent last, then the parent(s) will be in the unrelayed transaction pool. The compromise would allow for 3-5 transaction chains which would give significant functionality.</p>
