    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin network, Eric Lombrozo and other experts voiced concerns about increasing block size as it could externalize costs in dangerous ways. These costs would include not just equipment costs but also factors like block propagation latency and security risks. Some of these security risks were unknown in 2009 and were only appreciated recently. Lombrozo has been asking those concerned individuals to quantify these costs and write up the risks carefully. However, Lombrozo believes that the costs and risks of 8MB blocks are minimal, and the benefits of supporting more transactions far outweigh them. But, he finds it hard to have a rational conversation about this when even simple questions like 'what is a reasonable cost to run a full node?' are met with silence.</p>
