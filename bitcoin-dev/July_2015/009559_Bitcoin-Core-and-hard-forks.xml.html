    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion over whether Bitcoin Core can technically force anyone to run their code has been debated on this list. However, it has yet to be framed in terms of influence and leadership. The responsibility of the maintainers/developers of Bitcoin Core is to create software that promotes the security and operation of the Bitcoin network. Defaults are powerful as users prefer a trusted brand that does the right thing out of the box. Bitcoin Core and its maintainers play a valuable leadership role for the network, as people trust them. It seems unreasonable for anyone to expect Core maintainers to promote patches that endanger network consensus, such as user-configurable consensus parameters. Consensus is order of business #1 as everyone needs to agree to use the same money; otherwise, the grand experiment is resolved as a failure. It is the responsibility of someone to herd everyone toward using the same consensus parameters, sometimes even in the face of very high costs.</p>
