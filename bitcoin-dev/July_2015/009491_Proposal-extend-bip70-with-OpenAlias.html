    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around two separate issues: DNSSEC and payment requests. DNSSEC attests to an EC key stored in the wallet that is used to sign the payment request or URI, which includes a domain name. The payment requests under consideration have pki_type as "dnssec+btc" and pki_data as the user's alias (which means domain name). While some may not prefer using domain names under new roots as identity, this approach would work for those who do want it. It is suggested that an optimized BIP70 with compact cert and no DNSSEC could be explored in a QR code if creating a network that stores small bits of data proves difficult.</p>
