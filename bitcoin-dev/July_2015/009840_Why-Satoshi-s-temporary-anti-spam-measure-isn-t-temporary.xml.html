    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Milly Bitcoin proposes a process for measuring proposed changes against metrics and conducting risk analysis. The process includes a list of metrics, a risk analysis of the baseline system, mitigation strategies for each risk, a set of goals, and a road map for each goal. Proposed changes would be measured against the same metrics and a risk analysis done so it can be compared with the baseline. One of the metrics mentioned is a decentralization metric, and a framework for this metric is provided in a link. Another participant in the thread agrees that metrics and data can help when it comes to deciding on hardforks. They suggest having an imperfect decentralization metric rather than not having anything to compare proposals and add that sets of simulations should be used to calculate some of those metrics.</p>
