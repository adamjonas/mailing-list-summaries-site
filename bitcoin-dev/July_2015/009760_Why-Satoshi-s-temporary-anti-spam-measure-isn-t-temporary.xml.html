    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen, the topic of scalability of Bitcoin was discussed. Pieter suggested that block size should be scaled gradually over time according to technological growth. Gavin agreed with this idea and stated that it is exactly what BIP101 intends to do. He also added that miners would not produce blocks too big for whatever technology they are using. The conversation then moved towards discussing the scalability roadmap and the options available to avoid controversy. Gavin expressed his objection to the current status quo of having no plan for how to scale up and suggested that any plan requiring brand new technology will be riskier than scaling up what is already understood. He believed that it is worthwhile to scale up what we have in addition to working on great projects like Segregated Witness and Lightning.</p>
