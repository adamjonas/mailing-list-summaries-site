    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 has been released, which includes new features and bug fixes. Users are advised to report any bugs using the issue tracker on Github. It is important to note that this release makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download, which means that block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.Users can work around transaction flooding by increasing the minimum transaction relay fee or restricting the relaying of free transactions. Other notable changes include experimental support for big-endian CPU architectures, improvements to the algorithm used for fee estimation, and functionality to create a new circuit for every peer connection when the software is used with Tor.Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 also adds several configuration options and command-line options to improve the functionality of its wallet and network. Additionally, block and transaction handling have been improved, and there have been updates to the P2P protocol and network code. The build system has also been updated with several changes, including adding mips, mipsel, and aarch64 to depends platforms, fixing 'make distcheck', updating the OSX toolchain, and adding big-endian support.The wallet has been updated with a variety of improvements, such as discouraging fee sniping with nLockTime, enforcing minRelayTxFee on wallet-created transactions, and subtracting fees from amount. The GUI has also seen improvements, including new icons, HiDPI support for splash screen, optimizing PNG files, and preventing amount overflow problems with payment requests. Tests have also been added and improved.Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1 has been released with bug fixes and minor enhancements, including a fix to a block relay compatibility problem with some versions of OpenSSL and performance improvements to the signature cache. The release notes provide information about the contributors to this release.</p>
