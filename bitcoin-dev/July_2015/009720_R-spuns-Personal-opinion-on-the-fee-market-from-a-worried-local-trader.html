    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the discussion is about the establishment of a fee market for Bitcoin transactions. Vali Zero argues that if a fee market exists, spammers and gamblers would be the first ones to leave since they would have to pay for their activities. Vali also believes that people who actually need Bitcoin would remain, while those who could not afford the fees for its use would use altcoins instead. He suggests that in the absence of a functioning fee market, he will refuse to run Bitcoin code that increases the block size. Vali's argument is opposed by Angel Leon, who says that everyone should be free to use their money however they like, without anyone dictating what they should or should not do. Angel believes that Bitcoin should provide financial freedom and decentralization to its users, and it's an open network that should be used by most users as they see fit. Angel argues that without a blocksize increase, wait times will become unbearable for those not willing to pay the high fees. If people leave, then it only means that Bitcoin isn't useful, and if Bitcoin isn't useful, it's worthless.The email conversation between Vali Zero and Angel Leon was posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Vali is a local Bitcoin trader and computer engineer who has a reasonable understanding of free markets. He runs only one full node. On the other hand, Angel Leon is a person who values financial freedom and decentralization in Bitcoin transactions. In conclusion, the discussion revolves around the establishment of a fee market for Bitcoin transactions. Vali Zero argues in favor of a fee market, while Angel Leon opposes the idea. Both sides present valid points, but there seems to be no resolution to the issue yet.</p>
