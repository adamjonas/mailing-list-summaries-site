    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Pieter Wuille, Mike Hearn expressed his disagreement with the notion that Bitcoin Core developers have no authority over setting rules for the Bitcoin economy. He argued that due to the reality of Bitcoin Core's near 100% market share and limited GitHub commit access, they are effectively running the Bitcoin economy and therefore have the authority to set its rules. Hearn also stated that those who disagree with the current situation are left with only two options: either accept it or fork the project and the block chain with it. According to Hearn, until blockchain forks can be merged like Git repo forks, forking is not a safe option.</p>
