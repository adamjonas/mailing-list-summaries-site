    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Ryan Butler suggested that an increase in block size limit to 8MB could be beneficial for the network. He argued that miners should be allowed to mine low transaction fees at a profit and compete with each other. However, another participant, Adam Back, pointed out that any miner can break ranks and do so profitably, indicating that a decentralized mining system would prevent oligopoly behavior. The thread discussed the functioning fee market since 2011, where average fees have never been zero despite no block size pressure until September 2014. Additionally, empirical evidence indicates that wider Bitcoin usage is more effective than a quota at pushing up fees. Finally, the thread concluded that policies vary, and this is good for ensuring many types of transactions get processed.</p>
