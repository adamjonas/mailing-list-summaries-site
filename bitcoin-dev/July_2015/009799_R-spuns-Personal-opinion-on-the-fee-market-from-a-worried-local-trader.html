    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on 30th July 2015, Jorge Timón argues that a blocksize limit is necessary for decentralization but not for creating a functioning fee market. He suggests that if it can be agreed that hitting the limit will only result in higher fees and not cause Bitcoin to fail, then that would represent progress in the debate. The email also highlights differences in opinion about the necessity of a block size limit, with Jorge Timón stating that it is not required for a functioning fee market, unlike Adam Back. However, others, including Alan Reiner and Ryan X. Charles, have argued that even with "layer 2", a 1MB limit would be restrictive. The email exchange also points out the lack of a quantitative measure of decentralization in the ongoing discussion. Finally, the email compares Bitcoin users being slammed with higher fees to asking a child to work in a factory, suggesting that it is not practical or ethical to impose such pressures prematurely.</p>
