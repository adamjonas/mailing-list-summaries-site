    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation discussing the need for convenience in Bitcoin transactions, the issue of exchanging large data packets without a server acting as a dropbox was raised. Possible solutions included using other people's web servers or making the data packets small. The limitations of QR codes were also discussed, prompting the idea of finding a better replacement or dropping them as a design constraint. The possibility of using SSL certificates to create lightweight payment requests was also suggested. Additionally, the benefits and drawbacks of creating a Bitcoin-specific or independent PKI for individuals were explored.</p>
