    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris proposed a dynamic solution to increase the block size every 100k blocks (~2 years) as a backup plan if a permanent solution is not found. The proposed block size increase is as follows: block 400,000 = 2MB (2016), block 500,000 = 4MB (2017), and block 600,000 = 8MB (2018). Ross Nicoll agrees with this proposal but suggests switching over by block height rather than time and recommends a minimum target of 6 months for testing. Jeff Garzik opened a mailing list thread on this BIP as a minimum viable alternative plan to his preferred proposal (BIP 100). The benefits of this proposal include conservative increase, network upgrade, added growth, and least common denominator on an increase. However, it also requires a hard fork and another hard fork down the road.</p>
