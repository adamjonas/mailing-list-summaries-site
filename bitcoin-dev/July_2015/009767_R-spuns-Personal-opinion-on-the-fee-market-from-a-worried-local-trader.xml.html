    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The transaction count factor has been dominating the per-tx fee factor. This is a significant fact that should be of interest to miners. Blockchain.info's chart on transaction fees doesn't show what's happening to fees per transaction. Dave Hudson explains in his email response that the decline in fees continued until about 8 weeks ago when the "stress tests" first occurred. However, they are still below the level from the end of 2013, while the total transaction volume is up about 2.4x to 2.5x. He thinks it's easy to argue that wider adoption has caused wallet users to become much more effective at fee selection. Miners have continued to accept whatever fees are available, no matter how small. Only where there has been an element of scarcity have we seen miners do anything but take whatever is offered. There has not been any sort of fee market emerge to date other than as a result of scarcity during the stress tests.</p>
