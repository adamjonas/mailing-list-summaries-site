    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate over block size in the Bitcoin network is ongoing, with some developers advocating for a hard fork to increase the size beyond the current 1MB limit. However, others argue that the burden of justifying this change should be on those proposing it, and that it's not just about increasing the block size but also addressing issues such as expensive validation and fees. Some have pointed out that the security model has collapsed in the past due to these issues, requiring manual intervention to fix. Therefore, it's important to consider when and how the block size is increased, and focus on finding solutions to these problems before making any changes.</p>
