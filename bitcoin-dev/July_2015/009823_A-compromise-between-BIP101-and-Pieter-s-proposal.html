    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The argument has been made that decentralization security is necessary and critical to Bitcoin, and taking what security you can get from available defenses is important. There is concern that trusting data centers to run verified code, not get hacked, filter traffic, and respond to court orders without notifying the user is delusional. Data center operators are bound to follow laws, including NSLs and gag orders, and also get hacked, employ humans who can be corrupt, blackmailed, and themselves centralization points for policy attack. Snowden related disclosures and keeping aware of security show this is very real. Multiple nodes will save you from Sybil attack and geopolitical risks. If all data-centers and governments in the world are turning against Bitcoin, it is delusional to think we could fight against them without using any real weapon. It is suggested that running Bitcoin in an offshore VPS could be much easier if you are living in a country with repressive government.</p>
