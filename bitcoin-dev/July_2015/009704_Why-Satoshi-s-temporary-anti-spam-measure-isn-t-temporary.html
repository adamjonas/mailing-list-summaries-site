    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The historical reasons behind the block size limit are deemed irrelevant from an engineering perspective, but they still provide context for discussions and can help understand the motivations of participants. However, it should be noted that some assumptions made when the limit was decided have turned out to be incorrect, and other issues should be prioritized in any discussion regarding potentially incompatible consensus rule changes. The 1MB limit was put in place as an anti-DoS measure, not anti-spam, and was never intended to have any economic effect on spam or future fee markets. The relationship between block size and decentralization is empirical and should be considered when making decisions about potential changes.</p>
