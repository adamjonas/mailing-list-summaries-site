        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released new versions with features and bug fixes. The latest version, 0.11.0, contains a new fee estimator to more accurately calculate transaction fees and privacy feature called stream isolation for Tor. The release also supports block file pruning which allows for running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy of the raw block and undo data on disk. Other changes include autoprune functionality, the ability to disable wallet transaction broadcast, and an option to opt out of the alert system.The P2P network is being flooded with low-fee transactions, causing a ballooning of the mempool size. However, it's possible to work around this by increasing the minimum transaction relay fee minrelaytxfee, restricting the relaying of free transactions with limitfreerelay, and asking for an estimate for a higher target number of blocks. The update includes several bug fixes, including one that prevented seed nodes from being added to the list of known peers in some cases. New icons were added to the GUI section and payment request expiration bug was fixed. Version 0.11.0 also allows users to specify block and undo file space allotment, reduces default memory usage, adds support for big-endian CPU architectures, and creates a new circuit for every peer connection when used with Tor. Configuration and command-line options have been updated, while block and transaction handling have been improved. Wallet upgrades include discouraging fee sniping and subtracting fees from amount. The GUI has also seen improvements, including optimizing PNG files and preventing amount overflow problems with payment requests. Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1 was also released with bug fixes and minor enhancements. It has a fix to a block relay compatibility problem with some OpenSSL versions. Version 0.13.0 includes significant code improvements, reduced transaction fees, and increased efficiency of signature validation, among other updates. Both releases include information about contributors and upgrading procedures. The entire distribution is available as a torrent, and users can report bugs using the issue tracker at Github. Additionally, the release notes for Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1 contain a list of changes, including bug fixes and improvements to the software's architecture, implemented BIPs, and a bitcoin-cli man page. The credits section recognizes all contributors to the software, as well as those who provided code review and security research.</p>
