        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 has been released, offering new features and bug fixes. Users can report bugs using the issue tracker on Github, and the entire distribution is available as a torrent. Upgrading and downgrading should be done with caution, and it is advised to backup the data directory before downgrading.One of the notable changes in this release is the introduction of block file pruning, which allows for running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy of the raw block and undo data on disk. This feature can help reduce the storage space required for transactions and block data. However, it's important to note that block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet.The algorithm used for fee estimation has been improved, providing more accurate calculations for transaction fees. Additionally, new functionality has been added to create a new circuit for every peer connection when using Tor, enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of connecting to malicious or banned nodes.Various updates have been made to different aspects of the software, including configuration and command-line options, block and transaction handling, P2P protocol and network code, validation, build system, wallet, GUI, and tests. These updates aim to improve the overall functionality, performance, and security of Bitcoin Core.The release also includes several bug fixes, addressing issues such as seed nodes not being added to the list of known peers, compatibility problems with OpenSSL, and performance improvements for signature validation.Overall, Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 offers significant improvements and enhancements to the software, providing users with a more efficient and secure experience. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version and take advantage of the new features and bug fixes.</p>
