    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a developer named Jeff Garzik opened a thread on a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) as a minimum viable alternative to his preferred proposal, BIP 100. The BIP PR and Code PR were shared in the email. The general intent of the BIP is to provide a backup plan if agreement is not reached on a more comprehensive solution. The benefits include conservative increase, proving network can upgrade, permitting some added growth, and allowing the community & market to gather data on how an increased block size impacts privacy, security, centralization, transaction throughput, and other metrics. However, it requires a hard fork and another one down the road. A member of the list expressed concern over the idea and suggested that there are many solutions to the scaling problem that do not require a hard fork and are quite simple to implement.</p>
