    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin development community has been discussing the replacement of OpenSSL with alternative libraries, such as secp256k1. Pieter and Greg have tested this library rigorously and believe it to be more reliable than *SSL libraries. The consensus is that openSSL and its derivatives are not focused on consensus consistency, causing their own bug fixes to potentially break Bitcoin. As a result, developers suggest using alternative libraries like LibreSSL or BoringSSL instead. This change paves the way for non-OpenSSL signature verification in the future. The community recognizes the importance of security and continues to work towards improving Bitcoin's codebase.</p>
