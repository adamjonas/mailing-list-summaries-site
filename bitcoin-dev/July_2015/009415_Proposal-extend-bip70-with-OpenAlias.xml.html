    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between two individuals discusses the use of open standards for proposals in the NetKi space. The proposal does not rely on email and can issue usernames at web forums as aliases. A domain can use DKIM setup without offering email accounts, but can have a web form or API that triggers sending of signed emails, thus allowing the same system to be used by email providers and other sites. The lack of a store-and-forward network for signed payment requests is the holdup for usage of email certificates. Once a simple and robust way to get PaymentRequests from one end-user to another exists, getting an email cert issued would be no big deal. Separating identity providers from certificate issuers would be required for any solution, as many identity providers do not wish to become CAs too. The crt.sh website is a frontend to the CT protocol and could support other kinds of certificates if they became more widely used. To enable real adoption, solutions that do not require identity provider cooperation are necessary. Adopting existing infrastructure with a split CA/ID provider design still makes sense.</p>
