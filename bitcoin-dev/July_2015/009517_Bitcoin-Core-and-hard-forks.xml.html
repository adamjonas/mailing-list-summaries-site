    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, shared his personal opinion on the relationship between Bitcoin Core project and the consensus rules of Bitcoin. He believes that it is the responsibility of the maintainers/developers of Bitcoin Core to create software which helps guarantee the security and operation of the Bitcoin network. This includes participating in discussions about consensus changes, but not the responsibility to decide on them - only to implement them when agreed upon. However, he also added that intervening in consensus changes would make the ecosystem more dependent on the group taking that decision, not less. He further stated that if Bitcoin requires central control over its rules by a group of developers, it is completely uninteresting to him. Consensus changes should be done using consensus, and the default in case of controversy is no change. He believes that we should let a fee market develop soon rather than later, and that "kicking the can down the road" is an incredibly dangerous precedent. Ross, a participant in this discussion thread, suggests empowering users to control consensus, as he has been working on a fork framework that can support reasonably arbitrary consensus changes. He asked if that is considered desirable and whether he should raise it as a PR. Pieter did not respond to Ross's suggestion but emphasized his stance that consensus changes should be done using consensus.</p>
