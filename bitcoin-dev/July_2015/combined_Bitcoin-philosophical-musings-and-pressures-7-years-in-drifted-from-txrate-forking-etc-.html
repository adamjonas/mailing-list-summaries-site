        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The creation of Bitcoin and its underlying principles are often misunderstood by people. The system is too complex for some individuals to comprehend, and figuring out how to code, adopt or act upon it becomes a challenge. This complexity is exacerbated by the long term needs and values at stake. The purpose of creating a system where people can transfer money without being gated, permitted, hierarchied, middlemanned, taxed, tracked, stolen and feed-upon until pointless is beyond the comprehension of some individuals who are used to centralization, profit, control, and oppression.Some people see txrate ramming up against an artificial wall as perfectly fine, since it enables and perpetuates their legacy ways. Regardless of how the various walls are broken down technically, the most important thing is that they are. Those who think outside the box must take time to school these legacy people so that they might someday become enlightened and join the ethos. Otherwise, working for ICBC, JPMC, HSBC, BNP, MUFG, and governments may be an option, but probably not as much fun.</p>
