    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation posted on bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 23, 2015, discusses the network's available bandwidth for increased block sizes. One participant in the discussion references a number quoted by Gavin, stating that in its current state, 37% of nodes would fail to upload a 20MB block to a single peer in under 20 seconds. The same participant notes that if the bar for suitability is placed at taking only 1% of the block time (6 seconds) to upload one block to one peer, then 69% of the network fails for 20MB blocks. However, another participant points out that the findings are optimistic as they measure download capacity and not upload, which is further reduced by multiple peers needing to be sent blocks for reliability. Furthermore, the network needs significant additional margin to resist attack as performance is consensus-critical.</p>
