    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from July 30, 2015, Bryan responded to Thomas Zander's question regarding Bitcoin's future in light of low transaction space and high costs. Bryan stated that any decentralized system will inherently have high transaction costs and scarcity. He argued that Bitcoin is the only mechanism known for achieving this currently. However, as a centralized system, Bitcoin is already being outcompeted by many other designs. Bryan included his website and phone number at the end of his email signature.</p>
