    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Wallet Name Service is a decentralized and distributed service that does not require the use of Netki infrastructure. The service uses DNSSEC for privacy. However, unlike OpenAlias, it does not use DNSCrypt due to concerns about centralization and censorship resistance. By having a limited number of proxies, there are only a few actors for an authority or hacker to go to in order to install/force logging or censorship, which goes against the goals of the Bitcoin ecosystem. For highly privacy-conscious individuals, they can perform DNS lookups over a non-logging VPN connection or use DNSCrypt optionally themselves. The Wallet Name Service also has the option of storing a URL rather than just a wallet address in the TXT record, allowing a second-level lookup against the URL to get back a unique HD Wallet address or Payment Request each time, further protecting user privacy and security. The service always welcomes feedback from industry participants and is open to modifications based on community feedback.</p>
