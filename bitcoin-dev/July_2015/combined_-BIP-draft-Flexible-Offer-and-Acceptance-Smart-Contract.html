        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Michael Ruddy has submitted an informational BIP that contains two Bitcoin script constructs utilizing the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode. The script constructs will create a smart contract that allows a specific offer with flexible expiration time to be presented, accepted, withdrawn, or rejected. Initially, Ruddy submitted the idea for BIP65 usage, which he realized was large enough to be a BIP on its own. The draft of this BIP can be found at the given Github link. It is essential for those interested in smart contracts and Bitcoin technology to review the informational BIP. The small example implementation is also available at another Github link for further clarification.Overall, Michael Ruddy's contribution to Bitcoin technology through the creation of smart contracts demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology in creating secure and efficient payment systems. With the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, more innovative ideas like Ruddy's are likely to emerge, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible with digital currencies.</p>
