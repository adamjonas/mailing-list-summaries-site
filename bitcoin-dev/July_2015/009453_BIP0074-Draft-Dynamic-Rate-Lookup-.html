    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Micha Bailey and David Barnes on July 17, 2015 at 2:54 PM, the topic of discussion was about assigning numbers to a proposal. David mentioned that he picked up the next available number himself and stated that it can be changed to anything as the number 74 is unimportant to the proposal. However, Micha raised a concern if the number was assigned by Greg or not, as she didn't see any such assignment in the ML. Micha also pointed out that arbitrary numbers should not be used, especially if they are similar to ones already assigned.</p>
