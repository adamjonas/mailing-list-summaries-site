    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses the challenges of running a full node for Bitcoin in countries with repressive governments. The author argues that trusting data-centers to run verified code without being hacked and responsive to court orders is delusional. Data-center operators are bound to follow laws, including NSLs and gag orders, which could compromise the security of Bitcoin. However, one could establish multiple full nodes all over the world, including in offshore VPS, to ensure decentralization and avoid geopolitical risks. This strategy also saves one from Sybil attack and geopolitical risks. In conclusion, revolution is probably the only choice if all data-centres and governments in the world are turning against Bitcoin.</p>
