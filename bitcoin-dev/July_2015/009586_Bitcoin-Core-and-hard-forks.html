    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list on July 23, 2015, included arguments on whether to increase block size or work on scalability solutions like Lightning Network. Gavin Andresen advocated for working together to address the problems and scale it up while Eric Lombrozo argued that block size increases do not solve the issue of scaling the network and only postpones dealing with transaction fees. Lombrozo suggested that avoiding dealing with transaction fees constitutes a new economic policy, and it is essential to address it, as it is how the cost of operating the Bitcoin network is supposed to be paid for ultimately. Cipher Anthem suggested contributing to Lightning Network discussions to achieve scalability. Meanwhile, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed concerns about centralized block size limits, and Lombrozo added that increasing block size could risk the network's security model.</p>
