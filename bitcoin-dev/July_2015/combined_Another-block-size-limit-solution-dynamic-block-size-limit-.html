        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2015, Максим Божко put forward a proposal for the implementation of a dynamic block size limit for bitcoin. This proposal suggests adjusting the block size based on recent block sizes, giving miners the ability to determine the trajectory of block sizes. However, there are concerns that this approach could result in a decrease in the number of nodes capable of keeping up with the network, as well as a potential reduction in decentralization due to the more powerful equipment of miners.It is worth noting that discussions on this topic have taken place previously, although finding these discussions can be challenging due to the high volume of traffic on the list. For those interested in delving into the details of the proposal, a Google document has been provided in the email, which contains comprehensive information. Furthermore, Maksim Bozhko has also made it possible for individuals to provide comments on the proposal, allowing for a collaborative and inclusive approach to the discussion surrounding the implementation of a dynamic block size limit.</p>
