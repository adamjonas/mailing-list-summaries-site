    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Cory Fields suggested that Bitcoin Core and its enforced policies were being conflated, and that there was nothing stopping bitcoin from adding the ability for users to decide their own consensus parameters at runtime. A pull request was also made by a developer for creating a regtest-like testchain with a maximum block size chosen at runtime. Rusty used a less generic testchain for testing 8MB blocks, but nobody has yet used this patch to test any other size. The developer is in favor of preemptively adapting the code so that when a new blocksize is deployed, adapting the code will not be a problem, and offered their help to do so, which had been disregarded as "doing nothing" or having a negative attitude.</p>
