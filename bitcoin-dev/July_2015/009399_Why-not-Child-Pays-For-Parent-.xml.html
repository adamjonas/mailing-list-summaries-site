    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Reddit's r/Bitcoin, there has been discussion about a 24 to 48-hour interval at which miners clear their mempools. It is unclear whether this is a local policy or something that Bitcoin Core does by design. Jeff Garzik responded to a thread on this topic in 2015, suggesting that the issue was transaction expiration from the mempool rather than Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). One user proposed that a compromise would be to allow transactions with insufficient fees for peer-to-peer transfer to remain in a "deadman's land," but that CPFP could still be used on transactions meeting the minimum threshold for propagation. Another user explained that the current p2p protocol did not have a way to send multiple transactions in a single protocol message to indicate they should be evaluated together.</p>
