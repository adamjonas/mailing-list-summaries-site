    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ongoing debate surrounding the blocksize in the Bitcoin community has taken a non-technical and counterproductive turn. Gavin Andresen's initial blocksize posts were made in a non-technical blog for the public, rather than the Core dev team. Similarly, Jeff Garzik's recent efforts to raise the blocksize have been seen as fundamentally broken troll pull-reqs that can't be merged and are unrelated to blockchain capacity. Garzik's actions have been effective in framing the Core dev team's actions as a change, but they have not helped build consensus among the team. Cheap shots at vendors and drama on social media platforms have also proved to be counterproductive. The developers need to engage in real risk analysis and mature discussion about the issue rather than resorting to name-calling and non-technical arguments.</p>
