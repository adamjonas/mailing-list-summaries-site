    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on July 23, 2015, Jorge Timón wrote that the system would eventually need to be sustained by fees. However, fee revenue could rise without increased BTC fee rates. In fact, according to Timón, an increase in the exchange rate or an increase in the number of fee-paying transactions would be just as effective. Neither of these avenues requires increased "fee pressure" (scarcity of block space). Timón also disagreed that changing a constant is a "scaling solution." According to him, not many people on Reddit or elsewhere hold this view.</p>
