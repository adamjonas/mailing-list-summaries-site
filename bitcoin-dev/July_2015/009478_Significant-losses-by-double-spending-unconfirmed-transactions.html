    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion, Mike Hearn is questioned about pre- and post-Hearn relay drop rules. He responds by saying that he included patches by Gavin and Tom in Bitcoin XT. However, another member points out that the conversation was actually about the min-relay-fee drop that Hearn wrote, which is being exploited to double-spend. It seems that the fee drop has caused nodes to waste bandwidth and mempool RAM, leading to cheap OOM crashes. The email ends with a digital signature and an attachment.</p>
