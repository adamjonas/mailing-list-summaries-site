    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The premise of BIP37 bloom filters is said to offer privacy for the user by separating and anonymizing all requests and subscriptions. However, faulty assumptions and implementation failure in BitcoinJ have led to bloom filters identifying the wallet uniquely, resulting in no privacy for the user regardless of settings. Even if there were complete separation and anonymization, timing can still leak association between addresses to listeners. The solution proposed is to use a high latency mix network, but this may not be desirable as it would take a week to return results for a wallet with SPV security. Another important objective of query privacy is to allow the caller to make trade-offs between levels of performance and privacy. Prefix filtering enables client-tuning objectives and avoids server collusion attacks without being dependent on computational bounds. The primary trade-off is the size of the result set against privacy.</p>
