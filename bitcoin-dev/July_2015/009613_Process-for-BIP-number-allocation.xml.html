    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kalle Rosenbaum, a developer, has suggested adding a clause to the "BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow" section of BIP0001. The clause states that if a BIP editor cannot handle a BIP within a week, he/she should notify the author within that same week with an estimate of when it will be handled. However, there has been no response from Gregory Maxwell, the BIP editor, regarding Kalle's request for a BIP number allocation for Proof of Payment. In response, Peter Todd, another developer, has asked Kalle for an implementation of his proposed BIP, as the philosophy of the process is running code, preferably in production. Kalle provides links to a PoP-enabled fork of Mycelium and the server (validating code) on Github, as well as a demo site and video.</p>
