    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Jameson Lopp discusses the trade-offs of raising or not raising the block size. He believes that if the cost or contention of using the network rises to exclude the average user from making transactions, then they probably aren't going to care that they can run a node at trivial cost. He sees two primary points of view in this debate: decentralization and stability even if it retards growth of the ecosystem and pushing the system's load as far as we are comfortable in order to accommodate the growth it is experiencing. Jorge Tim√≥n responds to the proposal for long-term scalability by Pieter Wuille. He suggests that technological improvements should happen first before adapting the block size accordingly. He doesn't like to make any assumptions about technological advancements or economical growth, but he acknowledges that internet connections have improved overall around the world in the last 6 years. He prefers a more limited solution like BIP102.</p>
