        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Adam believes that the block size limit should be increased to improve decentralization, network reliability, and throughput. However, there are disagreements on important issues that are affecting Bitcoin Core's goal of building the "best" globally aware global consensus network. One disagreement is whether fees and hash-rate will be high by limiting capacity or if capacity should be limited to have a "healthy fee market." Another disagreement is whether every user needs to run a "full node" for better network reliability and transaction integrity validation. The third disagreement is whether Bitcoin Core should run as high-memory server-grade software rather than for people's desktops.Adam suggests allocating some within tech limits bandwidth to decentralization improvements and proposes hypotheticals for different growth limiters. However, he warns against pushing things to the extreme level of centralization, which could weaken the security of the main Bitcoin chain. Therefore, it's more appropriate for high scale to rely on lightning or semi-centralized trade-offs such as the side-chain model.The discussion revolves around scaling the Bitcoin network by increasing block size through a hard fork or side-chain. Potential benefits include faster transaction times and increased market signalling, but there are concerns about the limited scalability of simply doubling capacity. The group also discusses improving decentralization and analyzing bandwidth assumptions and game-theory in any proposal for scaling. It is noted that miners are currently imposing local policy limits on block size, and there may be value in mapping these limits to determine if the network is already at capacity.</p>
