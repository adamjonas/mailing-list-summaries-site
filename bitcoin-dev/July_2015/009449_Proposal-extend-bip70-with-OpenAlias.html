    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Netki, a company that provides open source tools for developers to build blockchain applications, has released an Addressimo API server that will provide unique HD wallet addresses or payment requests for every lookup. This allows users to have a private and secure way of sharing a wallet name that can be used to send any digital currency. The company has also released a Wallet Name Lookup server to help with the other half of the lookup problem. Netki is seeking feedback on Addressimo at this time. The OpenAlias standard is another option for developers and Netki has been urged to support it. However, Netki has clarified that its system has always been open and not required anyone to use the company's servers or interfaces. The company is willing to continue modifying its system to meet the needs of the community. While finding a common standard would be beneficial, Netki is hesitant to simply implement the OpenAlias standard without further discussion.</p>
