    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The founder of Social Minds Inc (KK), Edmund Edgar, has expressed his lack of interest in Bitcoin if it requires central control over its rules by a group of developers. He believes that consensus changes should be done using consensus, and the default in case of controversy is no change. In response to this, another individual in the discussion asked for more information about what the consensus might look like and how they will know when they have achieved one. The idea of "no controversy" was also brought up, and whether or not it is an impossibly high standard for such a diverse community. The discussion took place on various platforms, including Twitter and LinkedIn, with links provided for further information about Reality Keys.</p>
