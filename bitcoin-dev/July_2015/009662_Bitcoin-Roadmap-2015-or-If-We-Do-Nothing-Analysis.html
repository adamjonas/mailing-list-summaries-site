    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Adam Back, a contributor to the Bitcoin development mailing list, has suggested that blockchain companies running Bitcoin services should be required to run their own full nodes to ensure security. He pointed out that lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works as well as a lack of understanding of security engineering in general is probably a significant contributor to recent issues surrounding Bitcoin security. This comes after it was revealed that blockchain.info and Coinbase were not running full nodes at various times. Back argues that this is completely unacceptable and that it is important for companies to run their own nodes so as to depend on and cross check from. However, Back admits that he has been getting push-back to his proposal to add full nodes to the CCSS standard from those maintaining the standard.</p>
