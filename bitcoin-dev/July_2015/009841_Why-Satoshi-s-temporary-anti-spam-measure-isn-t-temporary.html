    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Eric, Milly Bitcoin, and Jorge Tim√≥n centers around the importance of avoiding controversial hardforks in the context of making changes to Bitcoin. Milly presents a proposed process that includes a list of metrics, risk analysis of the baseline system, mitigation strategies for each risk, a set of goals, and a road map for each goal. The goal is to have proposed changes measured against the same metrics as the baseline system so they can be compared. Jorge agrees that this process is reasonable and useful but emphasizes the need for hardforks to be uncontroversial to maintain Bitcoin's p2p nature. He suggests that metrics and data can help when it comes to evaluating proposals, including imperfect decentralization metrics. He also suggests using sets of simulations to calculate some of these metrics. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of having a clear, objective process for making changes to Bitcoin while also preserving its decentralized nature.</p>
