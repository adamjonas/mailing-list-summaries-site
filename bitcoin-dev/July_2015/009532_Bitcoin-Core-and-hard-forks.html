    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the message disagrees with Pieter's statement that Bitcoin Core is not running the Bitcoin economy and its developers do not have the authority to set its rules. They argue that Bitcoin Core does indeed run the economy and its developers have the power to create rules due to their ~100% market share and limited github commit access. The writer explains that people who disagree with this situation only have two options: accept it or fork the project and block chain with it. Those who object to forking are essentially suggesting that accepting the current situation is the only option, which has made many people angry.</p>
