    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of privacy is a significant concern for Bitcoin and is an essential aspect of fungibility, according to Eric Voskuil in an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He notes that popular wallets, which do not use change addresses, sacrifice users' privacy for the comfort of developers. While running a full chain wallet remains the only solution, this is not always viable. The clambering for the demise of the full node wallet is baffling, given its importance. Onion routing is not a solution as it opens up clients to sybil attacks. Introducing random timing variations into the mixnet may mitigate timing attacks, but this would worsen the already intolerable performance problem. SPV clients are neither secure nor private, and one should feel guilty for promoting them.</p>
