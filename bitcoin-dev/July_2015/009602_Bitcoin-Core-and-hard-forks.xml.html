    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Eric Lombrozo in 2015, Lombrozo stated that mainstream usage of cryptocurrency will be enabled primarily by direct party-to-party contract negotiation, with the use of blockchain mainly as a dispute resolution mechanism. He also claimed that block size isn't about scaling but about supply and demand of finite resources. Andresen disagreed with Lombrozo's statements, suggesting that it is a mistake to pick one use case and bet on it as the winner for mainstream adoption. He also criticized Lombrozo's false dichotomy in suggesting that increasing computational resources or increasing fees were the only ways to address the increase in demand for block space. Andresen disliked this "us or them" attitude and believed there are many things that can be done to decrease costs, including running a pruned full node.</p>
