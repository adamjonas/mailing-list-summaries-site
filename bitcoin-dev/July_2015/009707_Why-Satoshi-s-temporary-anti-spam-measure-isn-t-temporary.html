    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the given context raises a concern about the lack of progress in solving existing problems despite discussions that have taken place for years. The author further questions the motivation behind experts spending their time developing and testing code when it does not directly benefit them, but they are still held accountable if something goes wrong.It seems that the work of fixing technical issues is often viewed as "boring" or unexciting, which may result in little incentive for developers to invest their time in this area. However, there is a need for experts to focus on these tasks to ensure the smooth functioning of systems and avoid potential mishaps.The author's concern highlights the importance of addressing technical issues proactively to prevent larger problems from arising. It also indicates a need for developers to receive recognition for their efforts towards maintaining system functionality, even though the work may not be glamorous.In conclusion, the author's concerns emphasize the need for continued efforts towards solving technical problems, and recognition for those who invest their time and expertise in doing so.</p>
