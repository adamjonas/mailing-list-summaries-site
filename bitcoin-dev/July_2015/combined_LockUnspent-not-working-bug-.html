        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On a Bitcoin development mailing list, Ian Treibick reported an issue with the 'lockunspent' command on OS X with Satoshi 0.11.0. He mentioned that the TXID and vout belong to the wallet and that he was able to spend it even after locking it with the command. In his post, he included the command he used to lock the unspent transaction output (UTXO) and the subsequent 'listlockunspent' output, which showed no locked UTXOs. Ian expressed uncertainty about whether he had posted in the right place and asked if it would be better to open an issue on GitHub. The main issue highlighted by Ian is that despite running the lockunspent command and obtaining a 'true' output, the subsequent listlockunspent command did not list any locked UTXOs. However, he still found himself able to spend the locked transaction from the wallet. Unfortunately, no additional information was provided regarding other potential issues or troubleshooting steps taken.</p>
