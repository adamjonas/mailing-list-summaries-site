    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) have been assigned numbers 120 and 121. BIP 120 is for Proof of Payment, while BIP 121 is for a Proof of Payment URI scheme. Kalle Rosenbaum requested that these proposals be given their BIP numbers after much constructive discussion and feedback.During the discussions, Pieter Wuille raised some concerns about the Proof of Payment proposal, as it assumed that a transaction corresponds to a single payment. He suggested tracking payments instead of assigning identities to payers. However, Kalle believed that assigning a proof of payment was necessary for privacy reasons and proposed a nonce parameter in the URI, which was limited to 48 bits due to an OP_RETURN output limitation of 40 bytes.The context provided is a brief email conversation between Kalle and Pieter. Kalle thanks Pieter for his comments, but the rest of the conversation is not given. The conversation seems to be related to a reusable token that needs to be transferred to a friend. However, no information is provided on what this token is or why it needs to be transferred. It is not clear what the purpose of this conversation is and what the overall topic of discussion is.</p>
