    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is a response to a question regarding the time it takes for Electrum Server to index a validated block. In comparison to the Bitcoin Node Speed Test, the Electrum server software handles under load in order to allow SPV clients to quickly retrieve their history. Electrum wallet is extremely popular, and the distributed servers which power it are all hosted by volunteers without budget. The server requires a fully indexed Bitcoin Core daemon running, and produces sizable external index. Based on logs produced by the electrum-server console, it takes this server (Xeon, lots of memory, 7200 RPM RAID) approximately 3.7 minutes per megabyte of block to process into the index. This seems to hold true through the 10 or so blocks in the scroll buffer, and the contents of blocks seem to be of approximately the same processing load. Continuing this trend with the current inter-block time of 9.8 minutes, an electrum-server instance running on modest-high end dedicated server is able to support up to 2.64 MB block sizes before permanently falling behind the chain.</p>
