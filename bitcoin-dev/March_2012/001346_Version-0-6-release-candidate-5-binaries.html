    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin has announced that release candidate 5 will become the official 0.6.0 release on Wednesday, barring any last-minute showstopper issues. Users have been asked to help look for these issues. The new changes from release candidate 4 include faster writing of blkindex.dat during initial blockchain download using modified bdb environment cache settings and a new policy for wallet.dat upgrades. New wallets will use new features such as compressed public keys. A bugfix introduced in rc4 for an assertion failure that could occur during blockchain reorganizations and new code for managing the addr.dat file have also been included.</p>
