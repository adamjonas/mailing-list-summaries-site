    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Michael Grønager and Thiago begins with Thiago asking about the relationship between Libcoin and Bitcoin. Specifically, he asks if Libcoin is closely related to the original Bitcoin and if there are plans to update Libcoin with every new upstream Bitcoin release. Michael responds by explaining that there are options for doing things similarly in the libcoin repository. He also mentions that he intends to marketize the application in the near future, so updates will likely be made in a slightly different setup.In another email, Martinx thanks Michael for libcoin and requests that he create a regular Linux user called "blockchain" and start "bitcoind" under user "blockchain." This will allow the Bitcoin blockchain to be downloaded to the /var/lib/libcoin/bitcoin/ directory and consulted through libcoin itself. Michael responds by providing some tips.Elsewhere, a user has successfully configured and compiled libcoin but encounters an error with undefined reference when attempting to make it. The post also announces the release of the first version of the crypto currency library "libcoin," based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. Libcoin's functional code has been refactored and properly encapsulated classes, resulting in a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client. It downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Libcoin is licensed under LGPL v. 3 and can be used in open source as well as commercial projects.Lastly, the provided text includes contact information for Michael Gronager, PhD, Director of Ceptacle in Copenhagen, including his address, email, mobile number, and website. There is also a link to subscribe for releases at an unspecified platform. Additionally, there is a footer with information about a Bitcoin-development mailing list and a link to sign up for it.</p>
