        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gavin Andresen recently shared a link to a graph that shows support over the last 100 blocks. However, he later corrected the URL and provided the correct link to the pretty graph, which can be found at <a href="http://blockchain.info/P2SH">http://blockchain.info/P2SH</a>. It is unclear what exactly the support referred to in the graph measures, but it is most likely related to the Bitcoin blockchain.The corrected link leads to a website that provides information on Bitcoins and allows users to explore the network's activity. This communication seems to be directed towards those who are interested in tracking the activity of the Bitcoin network, particularly as it relates to support for certain features or protocols.In other news, the BIP16 switchover time of April 1 has been announced as final. Approximately 70% of hashing power has been supporting it for the last two days, with 54% support over the last week. Pools and miners who have not yet upgraded their software are encouraged to do so within the next two weeks to avoid hashing on a minority chain. Support will continue to be monitored to ensure no slipping before April 1.Furthermore, Gavin Andresen is currently drafting a document that suggests how to make the next upgrade process less painful. He also shared data showing support over the last 30 days using the search_coinbases.py command and bitcointools.For those interested, a graph of support over the last 100 blocks can be found at github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/. The graph provides further insights into the support for Bitcoin features or protocols.</p>
