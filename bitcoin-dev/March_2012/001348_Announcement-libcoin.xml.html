    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Michael Gronager discusses his Libcoin project with Thiago Martins. He mentions that he hopes to push Libcoin to Bitcoin at some point and is currently working to keep the two synced. He also did a presentation at BitCon12 in San Antonio and plans to update Libcoin on every new upstream Bitcoin release. Martins expresses interest in using Libcoin with P2Pool instead of Bitcoin and suggests that if it behaves like Bitcoin 0.6.0rc5, it could bring more attention to the project. Martins asks Gronager about Diaspora* Project and whether he has skills in Ruby on Rails development. Gronager confirms that he knows about Diaspora and even has an account, but he does not have skills in Ruby on Rails development. Martins explains his plan to include a wallet for each user in Diaspora, where Libcoin would be a perfect fit. The goal is to manage Bitcoins within Diaspora and allow users to send/sell Bitcoins between them.</p>
