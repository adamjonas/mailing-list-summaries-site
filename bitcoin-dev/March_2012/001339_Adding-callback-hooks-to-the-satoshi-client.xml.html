    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Thursday, March 22, 2012 at 1:13:13 AM, Eric Lombrozo proposed adding callback hooks to the main branch of code and offered to assist in reorganizing the code and contributing source code. However, there were concerns about allowing other code into the main wallet-handling process/memory space. It was suggested that instead, a Wallet Protocol be designed for general use between the wallet and GUIs/applications. A draft for such a protocol can be found at <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_protocol,">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_protocol,</a> but it was noted that it may be overcomplicated.</p>
