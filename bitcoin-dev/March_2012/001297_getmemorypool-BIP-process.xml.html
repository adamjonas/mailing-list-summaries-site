    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Stefan Thomas initiated a discussion regarding the use of polling model in BIP to request new work from a pool at intervals. He suggested specifying a version of the API supporting long-polling. The idea was appreciated as it would be beneficial for BitcoinJS, which supports JSON-RPC over TCP and is interested in a genuine "push" API. However, it was pointed out that HTTP and JSON-RPC are client-server models, which makes it impractical for the server to make calls to the client. Additionally, many clients cannot listen on WAN ports at all, making it difficult to expect them to run their own JSON-RPC server.</p>
