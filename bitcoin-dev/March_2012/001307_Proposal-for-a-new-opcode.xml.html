    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 3, 2012, Watson Ladd proposed a new opcode for anonymous transactions called OP_CHECKEXPSIG. This opcode enables scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction. Using this opcode, scripts can pass the nth note value proof that the notes {1,...n-1} were turned in and are distinct. It couples the strong double spend protection of Bitcoin with traditional digital cash's strong anonymity. Preexisting digital cash techniques relied on keeping track of a list of turned in notes to forbid double spending. However, on March 2, 2012, an individual named Michael Gronager expressed confusion about how OP_CHECKEXPSIG maintains protection against double spend. He mentioned that it is not until you redeem the OP_CHECKEXPSIG transaction that you reveal which former transactions were involved. He requested clarification about any point he might have missed regarding this matter. Michael Gronager is the director of Ceptacle, located in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
