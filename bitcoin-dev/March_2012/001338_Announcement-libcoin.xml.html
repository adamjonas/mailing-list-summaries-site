    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread starts with a discussion between Michael and Thiago about libcoin, a project that is chain-agnostic and can be used to initiate internal functions. The email mentions a bug that was fixed and provides a solution to a problem of default accounts not being listed on the output. Michael Gronager, Director of Ceptacle, announced the release of libcoin, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The build system of libcoin supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows using CMake. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3. Libcoin is chain agnostic, all chain specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain), making it easily accessible for research and educational purposes.There are also emails where Michael provides support to Martinx for compiling libcoin on Ubuntu 11.04 and warns about a conflict between boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0. In one email, Martinx reports that the installation of libcoin worked.Thiago had a query regarding the make command which resulted in errors. He received undefined reference error while trying to make, which indicates that the linker was unable to resolve some external symbol references. He also received a suggestion to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or update the ld.so configuration to find the installed libcoin libraries.</p>
