    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by Amir Taaki regarding the adoption of the BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) across bitcoin implementations. However, this proposal is not implementation-specific, but rather a generic proposal for multiple use-cases. Currently, bitcoind supports getmemorypool for a few use cases, but this proposed BIP would enable it to be utilized for many more. This standard is desirable as at least a few other pools wish to move toward a more decentralized method of pooled mining, similar to the proprietary p2pool protocol. Eligius already supports miners producing their own work with getmemorypool using this draft, and their open-source Eloipool server is available for others to adopt. It is reported that other pools not using Eloipool have also expressed interest in this.</p>
