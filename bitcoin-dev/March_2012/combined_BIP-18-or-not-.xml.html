        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In March 2012, Amir Taaki sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussing BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). The discussion focused on whether BIP 18 should be accepted into the repo or not, and the importance of following the proper protocol for evaluating and accepting BIPs. Luke-jr proposed support for BIP 17 after withdrawing BIP 16, which received a consensus to move forward. However, he submitted BIP 18, which is not considered tenable, as there seems to be no purpose to adopt it when BIP 17 is being adopted. Amir Taaki reviewed BIP 18 and concluded that it might not be technically sound and may not serve any purpose as they were already adopting BIP 17. He explained how BIPs are generally evaluated and accepted in the community. A draft BIP should be presented to bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net, after which the proposal is discussed and evaluated based on certain minimum criteria. Amir Taaki also mentioned that some BIPs, including BIP 18, have not followed this process before being accepted.The author suggests that BIPs be presented to the Bitcoin-dev list for discussion and to flesh out the draft BIP before acceptance. This helps ensure proper formatting and high-quality proposals that meet specific criteria. BIP 18 does not appear to have followed these guidelines, and the author questions whether it should be accepted into the repo. Criteria for accepting a BIP include being a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement, representing a net improvement, and having a solid proposed implementation that does not unduly complicate the protocol.</p>
