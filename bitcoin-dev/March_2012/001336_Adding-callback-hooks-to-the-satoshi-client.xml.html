    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread is about developing apps that require real-time event notifications in Bitcoin. Eric Lombrozo proposes adding callback hooks to the main branch to overcome the limitations of his current approaches, which involve either writing his own library or making custom builds of the Satoshi client. However, he recognizes that both approaches have significant drawbacks, including code duplication and the need to patch the client source with every new version. Michael Gronager suggests checking out libcoin, a fork of the Satoshi client that supports registration of listeners for new blocks and transactions. This functionality is used for connecting the wallet to the node. He provides a link to libcoin's GitHub repository.Gronager is the director of Ceptacle, a company that provides blockchain security solutions. His contact information is listed at the end of the email.</p>
