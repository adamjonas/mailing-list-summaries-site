    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Watson Ladd, Ladd proposes a new opcode for anonymous transactions. The opcode allows scripts to verify whether the recipient has carried out a previous transaction. However, Maxwell does not understand how this enables anonymous transactions. Ladd clarifies that one cannot use this opcode alone to secure a transaction; it is meant to prevent double spend attacks against anonymization schemes. To avoid this from leading to a double-spend, a quorum method is used based on showing earlier redemptions happened. When Maxwell questions why it is not isomorphic to a hash locked transaction, Ladd explains that you can't blind a Lamport signature which makes it different. Although the draft is not ready for anything official yet, Ladd is searching for a place to post it as it seems to be of interest.</p>
