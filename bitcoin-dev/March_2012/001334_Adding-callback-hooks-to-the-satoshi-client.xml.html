    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post from 2012, Eric Lombrozo expressed his need for real-time event notifications and proposed adding callback hooks to the main Bitcoin branch. He explained that writing his own library or making custom builds of the Satoshi client were not ideal solutions due to code duplication and the risk of breaking patches. Lombrozo offered to help locate key points in the source code, reorganize it, define a callback mechanism, and contribute source code. Matt, another member of the forum, replied to Lombrozo's proposal, stating that he had spent some time changing the internal Bitcoin code to use callback hooks, but it was far from complete and only usable within the Satoshi client itself. Matt also mentioned that the blockstore API might not remain stable in the foreseeable future. He provided a link to his work on Github. Overall, the forum post highlights the challenges faced by developers who require real-time event notifications and their efforts to find effective solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
