    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to bitcoin-dev, Karl-Johan Alm expressed his support for recent changes to the BIP. He agreed with the idea of permitting incomplete validators to return inconclusive results and saw this as a clear improvement. However, he did note that this suggestion breaks the original use of inconclusive as a way to detect future features used in the signature. He stated that it was undesirable for these things to become unconditionally invalid and suggested a fix by requiring reporting inconclusive instead of invalid whenever validation fails due to any standardness features, unless something is actually invalid. Pieter, who had originally suggested the two-checks approach, also chimed in and supported Karl-Johan's suggestion.</p>
