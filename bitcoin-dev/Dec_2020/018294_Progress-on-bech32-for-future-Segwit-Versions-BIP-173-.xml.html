    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, suggested that there is no reason to maintain the old-software-can-send-to-future-segwit-versions property, as some platforms did not support it, and even sent coins into a black hole. However, another developer, Dave, disagreed with this approach, saying that users of working implementations should not be denied the benefit of a feature just because some other developers failed to implement it correctly. Dave proposed a survey to see how many wallets already provide forward compatibility and how many would need to be updated for taproot regardless of the address format used. The results showed that only two wallets correctly handled v1+ BIP173 addresses, one of which was Bitcoin Core. Based on this survey, Dave now agrees with changing the checksum for v1+.</p>
