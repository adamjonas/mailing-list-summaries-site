    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around whether a BIP should be proposed related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban, a project by Samourai wallet. While some members believe that this is not a proposal to improve the Bitcoin protocol, others like Ben have tweeted that a BIP would make sense. Prayank, the original poster, argues that such a BIP could help other Bitcoin projects like joinmarket, coinswap, snickr, etc. To clarify, anything that makes sense to coordinate between different programs is BIP material, not just the core Bitcoin protocol. Prayank also provides links to the client library in Java and the server component in Go for those interested in the technical details of Soroban. However, some members caution that this mailing list may not be the right venue for proposing such a BIP. Despite controversial past discussions involving Samourai, Prayank emphasizes that anything that helps Bitcoin should be considered.</p>
