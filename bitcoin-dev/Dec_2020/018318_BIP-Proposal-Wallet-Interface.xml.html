    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This is a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that intends to define a simple interface for Bitcoin wallets and applications that would cover the majority of use cases. The proposal aims to enable writing Bitcoin applications such as time lock and multi-sig on the web that can be seamlessly used with any compatible wallets, promoting richer Bitcoin applications. Wallets should expose their address derivation and signing functions to external applications. The wallet API proposed in this BIP introduces requests to promote richer Bitcoin applications and defines an abstract format for flexibility. Wallets have a clear API to implement, applications have a clear expectation of wallet interface and behavior, and applications become agnostic to the wallet specifics, increasing choice for users. The proposal includes rules, types, and mandatory methods for the wallet API. Great care should be taken when exposing wallet functionality externally as the security and privacy of the user is at risk.</p>
