    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>I would like to address the inaccurate assessment of my honesty in running GAP600. The basis of this assessment is founded on assumptions that lack commercial experience and are therefore baseless. I have already provided clear access back in December to clarify our position to our clients, with their support being easily verified through transaction activity. This evidence should be sufficient to corroborate our statistics.Furthermore, I have offered a clear option for validating real Replace-by-Fee (RBF) adoption, which can be found at this link: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132issuecomment-1661960440">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132issuecomment-1661960440</a>. Implementing a solution similar to this would provide a comprehensive assessment of RBF adoption. However, since you are unable to provide any documents or public emails from hashing pools confirming their adoption of Full RBF, it appears that your conclusions are unfounded.In conclusion, it is important to refrain from making assumptions without the necessary commercial experience and evidence. As the CEO of GAP600, I am committed to transparency and providing verifiable data to support our claims.</p>
