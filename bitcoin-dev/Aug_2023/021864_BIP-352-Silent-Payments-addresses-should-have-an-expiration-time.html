    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Silent Payments could potentially solve the problem of address expiration. Payment requests often have expiration due to moving exchange rates, but there is currently no way to communicate this to sending software. The BTCPay checkout page includes a default 15-minute countdown. Payments made after the expiration are saved in an error state for the BTCPay operator and customer to address. Instead of enforcing expiration by consensus, a generic way to enforce it at the application layer could be using a new BIP 21 URI parameter called `req-exp=`. BIP 21 specifies that parameters starting with `req-` are considered required. Unknown `req-` parameters in URIs are considered invalid but can still be shown in the user interface. Support for `req-exp=` could be implemented in BIP 21 libraries, without needing to support it for each address type or requiring Silent Payments. New address specifications like Silent Payments could recommend wallets to request payments using BIP 21 URI and `req-exp=` to begin solving this problem. Wallets supporting Silent Payments & `req-exp=` could also apply expiration to older address types.</p>
