        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent discussion about block sizes, it is important to have a basic understanding of the topic before participating. To gain insight, a talk from a few years ago can be viewed at this link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNEQS80-h4&t=7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNEQS80-h4&t=7s</a> The question at hand is whether storage is actually limited enough. The answer is believed to be 'yes'. To illustrate this point, let's consider a worst-case scenario using the maximum block size of 4MB and a block time of 10 minutes. This would result in a growth of 210.24GB per year. While some of this data could potentially be pruned, for the sake of argument, let's assume it isn't. Currently, the entire blockchain is roughly 500GB. At first glance, this seems like significant growth potential. However, the cost of hardware today allows for a 5TB hard drive to be purchased for less than $150. With this capacity, the hard drive would last for 21 years before running out of space. This amounts to less than $0.02 per day. It's important to note that this worst-case scenario takes into account the current cost of hardware. Over time, the cost of hardware decreases, making it even less burdensome. Furthermore, efforts are being made to optimize the amount of data that needs to be stored by nodes. For instance, there is a node implementation called Floresta, which utilizes utreexo to enable nodes to function without maintaining the full UTXO set. This is just one example of the numerous initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of space individual nodes require. As a result, there is significant potential for optimization in terms of space utilization.</p>
