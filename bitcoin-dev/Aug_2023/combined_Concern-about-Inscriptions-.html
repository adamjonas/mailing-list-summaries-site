        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin script exploits have been a recurring issue in the Bitcoin system, with vulnerabilities dating back to CVE-2010-5141. These exploits are a result of the loose flexibility of the system in processing predicatives. Over time, more vulnerabilities have been exposed, prompting the need for strategies that are compatible with the current permission-less system.One proposed strategy is called Ordisrespector and Ordislow. Ordisrespector allows regular Bitcoin node operators to opt-in or not to a self-defense mechanism for their storage property and integrity. This is achieved by inserting arbitrary data into the witness structure as a signal of dissatisfaction with ongoing aggression. Transactions with inserted arbitrary data are not taken into the mempool and relayed. On the other hand, Ordislow gives node operators the option to increase the coercion cost of mining entities relative to the cooperation cost due to aggression via arbitrary data insertion. Blocks containing transactions with inserted arbitrary data are not propagated unless a configurable or maximum delay has elapsed.Moving on to the discussion on block sizes, it is crucial to have a basic understanding of the subject before participating. Contrary to common misconception, storage is not the main issue with block sizes. A helpful resource for gaining insight into this topic is a talk given a few years ago, accessible at the following link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNEQS80-h4&t=7s.The">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNEQS80-h4&t=7s.The</a> question of whether storage for blockchain is sufficient can be answered affirmatively based on several factors. In a worst-case scenario where the maximum block size is 4MB and the block time is 10 minutes, the annual growth would amount to 210.24GB. Assuming no pruning is desired, the entire blockchain is currently around 500GB, indicating significant growth potential. However, considering the cost of hardware, a 5TB hard drive can be obtained for less than $150, providing storage that would last 21 years before running out of space. This translates to a manageable expense of less than $0.02 per day, even in the worst-case scenario.Furthermore, the cost of hardware tends to decrease over time, further alleviating storage costs. Efforts are also underway to optimize the amount of data individual nodes need to store. One such initiative is Floresta, which utilizes utreexo to enable nodes to operate without maintaining the full UTXO set. This optimization potential, along with other ongoing initiatives, offers the possibility of significantly reducing the space required by individual nodes.In conclusion, while the growth potential of the blockchain may seem substantial, the combination of affordable hardware and optimization efforts ensures that storage remains sufficient for practical usage.</p>
