    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context provided is a series of email exchanges between Daniel Lipshitz from GAP600 and Peter Todd regarding the assessment of GAP600's services and credibility. Daniel defends the validity of their research by stating that it is based on monitoring main net transactions and network activity. He also mentions that they do not engage in specific hashing pool assessments or research.Daniel further explains that it is not feasible for them to disclose client names and applications due to fierce competition and industry norms. However, he assures that the information offered by Coinspaid, along with tools like Chainanlysis, can validate a significant amount of their traffic.In response to Peter's request for examples of merchants relying on unconfirmed transactions, Daniel provides an email from Max, the CEO of Coinspaid, confirming their use of 0-conf and providing cluster addresses to validate their deposit flows. He suggests reaching out to Max at Coinspaid for further confirmation. Daniel also mentions speaking to Changelly, who offered to confirm GAP600 as a service provider via email.Peter expresses skepticism and requests concrete examples of merchants using Coinspaid and Coinpayments that rely on unconfirmed transactions. He questions why there is a lack of transparency in providing such examples. Peter also requests information about the services Changelly offers that rely on unconfirmed transactions.In response, Daniel encourages Peter to email Changelly for confirmation and offers to check if the tested transaction hash was queried in their system. However, Peter declines to provide exact transaction hashes to avoid any potential problems for the account owners.The conversation continues with Peter questioning the impact of full RBF on businesses and requesting contact information for mining pools that have adopted FULL RBF. Peter also highlights concerns raised by mining pools about harassment related to full RBF.In conclusion, the email exchanges revolve around the validation of GAP600's services and the request for concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. The conversation also touches upon the potential impact of full RBF on businesses and the reluctance to disclose private contact information due to concerns about harassment.</p>
