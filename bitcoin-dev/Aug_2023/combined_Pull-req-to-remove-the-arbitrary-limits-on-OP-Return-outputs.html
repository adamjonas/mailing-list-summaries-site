        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Hi Peter,I have a few questions regarding your proposal to remove the restrictions on OP_RETURN outputs. Firstly, I would like to know if there are any cases where using OP_RETURN to embed data actually results in fewer bytes onchain compared to embedding the same data using segwit/taproot witness space. Robin Linus suggested that there might be a case where small inscriptions receive a discount, resulting in fewer bytes onchain. It would be helpful to have confirmation and specific details about the range of inscription sizes that would receive this discount.Secondly, I would like to know if there are any tools available for full node operators to prune OP_RETURN data from their nodes. While researching this, I came across PR 2791 by Pieter Wuille, which implemented pruning of provably-unspendable outputs, including OP_RETURN outputs. I have a couple of questions related to this: i) Is the unspendable output pruning implemented in PR 2791 enabled by default or does it require a flag to be set by full node operators? If it requires a flag, what is the name of the flag and how can it be enabled? If it's enabled by default, how can it be disabled?ii) If a full node operator prunes OP_RETURN outputs, does it affect their ability to assist a new node with initial blockchain validation (IBD)? And would the answer be different if we were talking about pruning Taproot witness space instead of OP_RETURN outputs?Regarding the rationale behind your proposal, Sjors Provoost suggested on GitHub to send an email to this mailing list to notify the intention of merging the pull-request. The pull-request aims to remove the arbitrary restrictions on OP_Return outputs, specifically the 80-byte and 1 output per transaction standardness rules. The purpose of this proposal is to potentially eliminate transaction pinning vectors. Although the author of this email does not consider transaction pinning to be a significant concern, they still send this email as a notice of their intent.For more information on transaction pinning, readers can refer to the Bitcoin Operations Guide's article on the topic [1]. Additional insights can also be found on Peter Todd's website [2]. If you want to contact Peter Todd directly, his email address is peter@petertodd.org.</p>
