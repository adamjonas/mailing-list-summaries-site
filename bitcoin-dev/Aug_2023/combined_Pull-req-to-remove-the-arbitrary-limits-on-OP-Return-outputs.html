        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email addresses two main topics. First, it discusses the impact of a proposed policy change on full node operators regarding the use of OP_RETURN to embed data on the blockchain. The writer seeks clarification on whether using OP_RETURN or segwit/taproot witness space would result in fewer bytes on the blockchain, particularly for small inscriptions. They also request confirmation and specific details about the range of inscription sizes that would receive a discount.Second, the email addresses the prunability of OP_RETURN outputs. The writer asks if there are any tools available for full node operators to prune this data from their nodes. They mention PR 2791 by Pieter Wuille, which implements pruning of provably-unspendable outputs, including OP_RETURN outputs. The writer inquires about the default setting and enabling or disabling options for unspendable output pruning. They also ask about the potential impact of pruning OP_RETURN outputs on assisting new nodes during initial block download (IBD), and if the answer would differ for pruning Taproot witness space.Additionally, the email mentions Sjors Provoost's suggestion on GitHub to send an email notifying their intention of merging a pull-request. The pull-request aims to remove the arbitrary restrictions on OP_Return outputs, specifically the 80-byte and 1 output per transaction standardness rules. The author acknowledges the concern of introducing new pinning vectors but does not consider it significant. They mention that some miners are already mining non-bitcoin-core-standard transactions, implying that these pinning vectors may already exist due to the hash power of those miners. For further information on transaction pinning, they provide links to the Bitcoin Operations Guide article and Peter Todd's website, along with Peter Todd's email address.</p>
