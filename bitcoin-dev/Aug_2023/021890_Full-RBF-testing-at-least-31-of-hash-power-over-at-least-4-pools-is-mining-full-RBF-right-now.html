    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the testing and findings related to the adoption of full-RBF (Replace-By-Fee) in Bitcoin mining. The sender conducted tests by sending two transactions, one with a high fee and another with an even higher fee as a double spend. The propagation of these full-RBF double-spends was verified by checking the debug.log file on a well-connected node.The results indicate that more than 31% of hash power from at least four different pools is currently mining full-RBF. This finding supports the sender's previous research using the OTS (On-This-Spot) calendar approach, which yielded similar results. The email provides specific transaction IDs for successful full-RBF double-spends from pools like Antpool, Poolin, EMCDPool, and Binance Pool.To verify these double-spends, anyone running a full-RBF node with debug=mempool can examine their debug.log files. It is highly likely that Antpool, Poolin, and EMCDPool are mining full-RBF with approximately 100% of their hash power. Binance Pool did not mine a full-RBF replacement on two occasions, suggesting they may be mining full-RBF with less than 100% of their hash power.Furthermore, the sender's research using the OTS calendar approach found examples of KuCoinPool and ULTIMUSPOOL mining full-RBF double spends. However, no data on them was obtained during the testing. Luxor and MARA Pool mined some blocks without mining the double-spends, indicating they may have full-RBF fully or partially disabled.The email also mentions the tool used for these tests, which can be found at a provided GitHub link. However, it should be noted that the script was written years ago and may have bugs or compatibility issues with newer versions of Bitcoin Core and python-bitcoinlib. It is advised not to use the tool on a wallet with funds that cannot be affordably lost.In closing, the sender mentions the expenses involved in this research, both in terms of time and transaction fees. Donations are appreciated to support the sender's work on full-RBF and cover these expenses.</p>
