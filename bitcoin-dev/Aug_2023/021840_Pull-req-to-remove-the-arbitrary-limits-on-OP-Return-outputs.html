    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sjors Provoost suggested on GitHub that they send an email to this mailing list to notify their intention of merging a pull-request. The pull-request aims to remove the arbitrary restrictions on OP_Return outputs, specifically the 80-byte and 1 output per transaction standardness rules. The rationale behind this proposal is to potentially eliminate transaction pinning vectors. However, the author of the email does not consider this concern to be significant.The author acknowledges that removing standardness restrictions may introduce new pinning vectors, but they argue that this is a potential issue with any relaxation of standardness rules. Despite their dismissal of the concern, they still send this email as a notice of their intent. They mention that some miners are already mining non-bitcoin-core-standard transactions, which implies that these pinning vectors may already exist due to the hash power of those miners.For further information on transaction pinning, readers can refer to the Bitcoin Operations Guide's article on the topic [1]. Additionally, more insights on this subject can be found on Peter Todd's website [2]. To contact Peter Todd, his email address is peter@petertodd.org.</p>
