    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sjors Provoost has suggested sending an email to the mailing list to notify them about the intention to merge a pull request. The pull request aims to remove the standardness restrictions on OP_Return outputs, which currently limit them to 80 bytes and 1 output per transaction. The rationale behind this proposal is that removing these restrictions could potentially open up additional transaction pinning vectors.Transaction pinning refers to the practice of intentionally including certain transactions in blocks to prevent other transactions from being confirmed. While some may consider the potential for transaction pinning to be a problem, the author of the email does not view it as a significant concern.The author also mentions that some miners are already mining non-bitcoin-core-standard transactions.</p>
