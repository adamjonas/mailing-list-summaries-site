        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this email, Greg provides some additional information related to a topic discussed in a previous conversation with Brandon. He mentions the term "OP_2" and suggests that it should be sent to "OP_4" instead. Additionally, Greg points out that BIP118 allows for the use of the pubkey "1" as a substitute for the taproot inner pubkey. He suggests that simply adding an opcode like "OP_INNER_PUBKEY" could achieve the same effect.Greg also highlights that BIP118 addresses taproot malleability bugs by allowing non-APO signatures to have a sighash digest that commits to additional data. He includes a link to a discussion on GitHub for further exploration of this topic.Overall, Greg acknowledges that these details are not crucial but suggests that it would be beneficial to address them if possible.</p>
