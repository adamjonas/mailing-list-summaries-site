    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context provided, the issue of granularity in applying limits and suggestions for improvement are discussed. The current practice of determining the limit based on when it is applied is described as a UX nightmare. To address this, it is suggested to select a useful granularity and include enough bytes of an integer that can accommodate future needs. For example, using 3 bytes or 24-bits to represent days would provide a range of 45,000 years, which is deemed sufficient.One potential drawback of an alternative suggestion is highlighted. It is argued that this suggestion would result in a protocol that degrades over time, as the granularity of newly created addresses increases. This is contrasted with situations like CTV/CLTV, where something is being created now with a limit set in the future. In the case of silent payments, it is predicted that even 100 years from now, people would still want to create addresses that expire after a certain period, such as 30 days. However, the alternative suggestion does not allow for this flexibility.To further explore these ideas and perspectives, additional information and insights can be found on Peter Todd's website at the link provided: <a href="https://petertodd.org">https://petertodd.org</a>.</p>
