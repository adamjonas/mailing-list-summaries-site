    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the issue of determining the granularity of a limit when applying it to a certain context. It suggests that instead of basing the limit on the specific time it is applied, it would be easier to choose a useful granularity and include enough bytes of an integer to ensure it remains effective in the future. The suggestion is made that using 3 bytes or 24-bits for days would provide a limit of 45,000 years, which is considered sufficient. The email also mentions that implementing a suggestion like this would prevent the protocol from degrading over time, as the granularity of newly created addresses would increase. It distinguishes this situation from CTV/CLTV, where something is being created now with a limit set for the future. The email concludes by pointing out that even in the distant future, if silent payments still exist, people would still want to create addresses that expire after a certain period (e.g., 30 days), which the suggested approach allows for.</p>
