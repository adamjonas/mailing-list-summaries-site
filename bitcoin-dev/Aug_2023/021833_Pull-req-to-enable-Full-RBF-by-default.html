    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been pointed out that the research conducted by Daniel Lipshitz, representing GAP600, is not thorough and has led to an incorrect conclusion. Lipshitz asserts that GAP600 services multiple merchants, such as Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly, who accept unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions with the use of mitigation tools. In response, Peter Todd, in an email, disputes this claim and questions the validity of Lipshitz's findings.Todd clarifies that both Coinpayments and Coinspaid are payment processors, rather than individual merchants accepting unconfirmed payments. Todd couldn't find any evidence on their websites indicating acceptance of unconfirmed transactions. As for Changelly, Todd argues that their website clearly states an average transaction speed of 5-40 minutes, which does not qualify as an unconfirmed payment. Todd further verifies this by conducting test transactions, which confirm that Changelly does not accept unconfirmed payments.In light of these discrepancies, Todd challenges Lipshitz to provide a genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions and relies on first-seen behavior. Todd also highlights that based on his findings, there has been no impact of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) on double spend rates for GAP600 transactions, suggesting that GAP600 does not have clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.Lipshitz is requested to provide additional evidence, including emails and contacts from mining pools that have adopted full RBF, to support his claims.</p>
