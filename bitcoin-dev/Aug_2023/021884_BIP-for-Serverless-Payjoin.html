    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dave is concerned about the security of posting payment URIs in a way that can be seen by others. He mentions a scenario where Alice posts her BIP21 URI for Bob to pay, but Eve can also see it. Dave questions whether Eve could establish her own session to the relay, intercept Bob's PSBT (partially signed Bitcoin transaction), modify it to include her output, and then submit it for Bob to sign and broadcast. He acknowledges that currently, users don't treat posting BIP21 URIs as a significant risk to funds but rather a privacy risk. However, he believes it would be better to have a protocol where eavesdropping doesn't create a risk of funds loss.</p>
