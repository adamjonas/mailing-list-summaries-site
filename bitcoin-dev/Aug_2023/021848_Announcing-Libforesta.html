    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Davidson Souza has announced the development of `libfloresta`, a derivate of the project called Floresta, which is an Utreexo-powered, fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main goal of the project is to create a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for end-users, particularly for low-power devices like single-board computers (SBCs) and smartphones. Davidson is writing the main logic in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere through WebAssembly (WASM).The project is currently in an early stage but has been successfully used on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be addressed before setting them up as Utreexo peers. The project is available on Davidson's GitHub page, and he has also written a blog post explaining how to use it in Rust. Feedback on the project is welcome.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that the project does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to use the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future to minimize misimplementations leading to splits. He is also cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they cause problems.Davidson expresses his gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta.In response to questions raised by leohaf, Davidson confirms that the implementation of Floresta is not able to start other nodes, whether they are on the reference implementation or on Floresta. Floresta is a prune-first node meant to be used with only outgoing connections. Switching from Bitcoin Core to Floresta without causing a new Initial Block Download (IBD) is not trivial, but it is possible by reconstructing the accumulator locally with the position of each leaf provided. Floresta is also working towards being backward compatible with Bitcoin Core's RPC commands, particularly those used in the watch-only wallet and for pulling general chain data.Overall, this announcement introduces `libfloresta`, a compact and fully-validating Bitcoin full node built on Utreexo technology. It aims to provide a user-friendly experience while running efficiently on low-power devices.</p>
