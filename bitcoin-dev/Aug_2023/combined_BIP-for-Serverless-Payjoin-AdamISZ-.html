        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email discusses the interest in standardizing a protocol. The sender suggests using base64url encoding instead of base64 encoding for the psk in the URI to improve readability and avoid complexity. They express appreciation for feedback from "waxwing" and mention that they have resolved the mentioned flaws. The sender explains their decision to use a symmetric key over DH for receiver authentication to avoid additional communication rounds. They propose a solution to mitigate attacks by having the receiver share a public key of a per-request keypair. They mention the use of BIP 47 codes and ephemeral keys for enrolling multiple buffers at a relay simultaneously. The sender acknowledges the concern of relays having metadata that could be used for timing attacks and suggests a random delay based on a Poisson distribution as a mitigation. They refer to a research study by S. Ghesmati in 2020 which supports the idea of payjoin transactions. The sender expresses reluctance to require Tor for deployment and suggests considering Oblivious HTTP instead. They address the concern of timing correlation attacks and suggest a specified delay. The sender agrees that padding should be a requirement and discusses the buffer size, noting the overhead of PSBTs compared to consensus transactions. They thank the recipient, Dan, for the feedback.</p>
