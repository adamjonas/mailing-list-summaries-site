    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Samson Mow questions the 180-year limit for planning and suggests considering a longer timeframe. He compares this limit to the relatively short time since the invention of practical electric motors (137 years ago) and light bulbs (143 years ago). However, Peter Todd counters that 180 years is indeed a long time. To provide perspective on longer timescales, Todd mentions that 3 bytes would be sufficient for 45,934 years. To emphasize the significance of this, he notes that agriculture, which is essential to human civilization, has only been around for 12,000 years. Additionally, Todd playfully mentions that as a "toxic bitcoin carnivore," Samson may find the invention of the bow and arrow 70,000 years ago more interesting. This exchange highlights the different perspectives on the concept of time and the need to consider various factors when planning for the future.</p>
