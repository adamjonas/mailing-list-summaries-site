    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>137 years ago, the first practical electric motor was invented, and 143 years ago, the first practical light bulb was invented. These inventions have significantly impacted our lives over the past 180 years. However, in terms of technology, even a small amount of data can hold a vast amount of information. For example, 3 bytes of data can store information for 45,934 years. Looking back in history, the invention of agriculture is only 12,000 years old, which marks a significant milestone in human civilization. However, for those with a specific interest in technology, the invention of the bow and arrow, 70,000 years ago, may be more relevant.
