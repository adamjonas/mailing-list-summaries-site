    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Wallets can be compromised or lost, resulting in the addresses generated from those wallets becoming toxic data. This means that funds sent to those addresses can be easily lost forever. While all Bitcoin addresses have this problem, existing Bitcoin addresses are not supposed to be reused. However, Silent Payments addresses are meant to be reused multiple times without privacy concerns. Therefore, it is crucial for Silent Payment addresses to eventually expire in a reasonable amount of time.The solution to this problem is simple: adding a 3-byte field to Silent Payments addresses that encodes the expiration date in terms of days after a certain epoch. The suggested duration is 2^24 days, which is equivalent to 45,000 years. However, even 2 bytes (equivalent to 2^16 days or 180 years) should be sufficient, considering the longevity of Bitcoin itself.In order to ensure usability, wallets should set a default expiration date for newly created addresses, such as 1 year. If someone attempts to pay an expired address, the transaction should fail with a simple message stating "address expired". This approach is similar to how Lightning invoices expire for user experience reasons, even though they do not technically require expiration.Implementing these changes would help prevent the loss of funds and improve the overall functionality of Silent Payments addresses.</p>
