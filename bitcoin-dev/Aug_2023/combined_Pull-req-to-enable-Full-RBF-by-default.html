        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Claims of "trxs activity" being meaningful without proof of reliance on unconfirmed transactions are questioned. The OpenTimestamps calendars have been creating full-rbf double spends daily, indicating the availability of test data. The lack of awareness of full-rbf replacements by the claimed "real-time risk engine" raises doubts about its effectiveness. Concrete examples of merchants relying on unconfirmed transactions are requested to validate the service's value.GAP600 clarifies that their research is based on monitoring main net transactions and network activity, but they do not engage in specific hashing pool assessments. They explain that providing client names is not feasible due to competition, but they offer validation through root addresses associated with Coinspaid. They suggest reaching out to Max at Coinspaid for confirmation. They also mention contacting Changelly for verification. The company disputes the assumption of dishonesty and offers clarification on their statistics and risk assessment process.The request for examples of actual merchants using Coinspaid, Coinpayments, and Changelly platforms accepting unconfirmed payments goes unanswered. Verification shows no evidence of unconfirmed transaction acceptance by these platforms. GAP600's mitigation tools aim to prevent negative impacts on merchants and users who accept 0-conf transactions. They provide statistics and CEO feedback from Coinspaid as evidence. The impact of full RBF adoption on double spend rates is disputed, and the need for a "first seen safe" rule is emphasized.The author's pull request to Bitcoin Core proposes enabling full-rbf by default. Some block explorers, nodes, and pools have already adopted full-rbf. Successful full-rbf replacements are observed, but limited node relay poses challenges in multi-party transactions. Opposition to full-rbf adoption is questioned, as there is no evidence of actual use of unconfirmed transactions by Bitrefill. Test transactions conducted by the author required confirmation, indicating the absence of unconfirmed payment acceptance.In recent times, there has been a trend towards eliminating the option to set non-BIP125-rbf transactions. Various wallets, such as Electrum, Phoenix, Green, Nunchuck, and Zeus, have already removed the ability to turn off BIP125. The main reason behind this shift is that these wallets consider "non-replaceable" transactions to be a support headache. The author of the context argues that the idea of using Bitcoin for "on-chain coffee payments" is no longer feasible. This is due to the fact that a significant portion of hashing power in the network ignores the BIP125 distinction.In light of this, the proposal suggests enabling full-rbf (replace-by-fee) by default in the upcoming release of Bitcoin Core's GitHub master, specifically in version 26.0. To further support this suggestion, the author proposes deprecating and eventually removing all BIP125 code and associated complexity in future releases. It is believed that this step would streamline the system and eliminate unnecessary complications.Throughout the context, several references are provided to reinforce the points made. These references include examples of block explorers enabling full-rbf, nodes running full-rbf, multi-party transactions with full-rbf, opposition to full-rbf from Bitrefill, removal of non-BIP125-rbf transactions in on-chain wallets, and the value of enabling full-rbf by default. By utilizing these references, the author strengthens their argument and provides additional information to support their viewpoint.</p>
