        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context has submitted a pull request to Bitcoin Core to enable full-replace-by-fee (full-rbf) by default. They argue that around 40% of the total Bitcoin hash power is already mining full-rbf replacements across various pools. Block explorers like blockstream.info and mempool.space have also enabled full-rbf on their nodes, and BTCPay Server and MyNode installations have full-rbf enabled by default.However, the author acknowledges that only a minority of nodes currently relay full-rbf replacements, which creates a barrier to utilizing them in multi-party transactions. To address this issue, they propose enabling full-rbf by default in Bitcoin Core's GitHub master, with the release of v26.0. The author suggests deprecating and eventually removing all BIP125 code and associated complexity in future releases.The author provides references to support their arguments. These references include information on block explorers and nodes enabling full-rbf, as well as opposition from Bitrefill, who claimed to have a use for unconfirmed transactions but could not find evidence of their continued acceptance.The context also includes a discussion between the author and Daniel Lipshitz of GAP600, a service provider for BTC transactions. Lipshitz argues that implementing full RBF without a "first seen safe" rule would have a negative impact on merchants and users who accept 0-conf transactions. He mentions clients like Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly that rely on GAP600's services. However, Peter Todd, the author, questions whether these platforms actually accept unconfirmed payments and requests genuine examples of merchants who rely on unconfirmed transactions.Todd further points out that on-chain wallets have been moving towards removing the ability to set non-BIP125-rbf transactions, as they consider them a support headache. He believes that maintaining the BIP125 distinction is unnecessary when a significant portion of hashing power ignores it.In conclusion, the author argues for enabling full-rbf by default in Bitcoin Core to address the limited adoption of full-rbf and proposes removing BIP125 code and complexity in future releases. However, questions regarding the acceptance of unconfirmed transactions by certain platforms and the impact on merchants and users remain unresolved.On the other hand, GAP600, a service provider for BTC transactions, argues that implementing full Replace-By-Fee (RBF) without a "first seen safe" rule could negatively impact merchants and users accepting 0-conf transactions. To mitigate this, GAP600 requires replacement transactions to include original outputs, preventing negative impacts. They have observed strong usage for BTC, with approximately 350k unique transaction hashes per month over the past three months. Notable clients of GAP600 include Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly.When the Mempool is full, there is an increase in the fee required to be approved by GAP600 for transactions. This use case has been significant and can be easily maintained as it currently stands. Statistics and direct feedback from the CEO of Coinspaid provided by GAP600 suggest that the stated figure of 40% adoption of full RBF by miners is questionable. The lack of impact on double spend rates for their transactions indicates that the adoption rate may not be as high as claimed.GAP600 anticipates that once the default setting for RBF is changed, their service's adoption will be greatly influenced. Their model aims to minimize errors by reimbursing clients for any incorrect predictions of double spends. It is important to note that GAP600 is not a payment processor but provides services to payment processors, merchants, and non-custodial liquidity providers for non-custodial wallets.In conclusion, the addition of a "first seen safe" rule is crucial to avoid the negative consequences of implementing full RBF in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
