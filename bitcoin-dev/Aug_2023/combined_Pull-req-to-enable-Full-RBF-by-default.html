        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Daniel Lipshitz, representing GAP600, has defended the use of unconfirmed transactions by Coinspaid and challenged the skepticism of Peter Todd. However, Todd disputes Lipshitz's claims and questions the validity of his findings. Todd clarifies that Coinpayments and Coinspaid are payment processors, not individual merchants accepting unconfirmed payments. He also argues that Changelly does not accept unconfirmed payments based on their website information and test transactions. Todd challenges Lipshitz to provide concrete examples of actual merchants accepting unconfirmed transactions.In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the proposal to add a "first seen safe" rule to mitigate the negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users accepting zero-confirmation transactions was raised. Lipshitz expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of full RBF and mentioned the strong usage of GAP600's services for Bitcoin. However, Todd's investigation reveals that there is no evidence of actual merchants using Coinpayments and Coinspaid platforms to accept unconfirmed payments. The lack of impact on double spend rates for GAP600's transactions suggests they don't have clients relying on unconfirmed payments.GAP600 has provided statistics and feedback from the CEO of Coinspaid to support their claims. They argue that the addition of a "first seen safe" rule is crucial to avoiding the negative consequences of implementing full RBF in Bitcoin transactions. They also reimburse their clients for any incorrect predictions of double spends. It is important to note that GAP600 is not a payment processor but provides services to payment processors, merchants, and non-custodial liquidity providers serving non-custodial wallets.The author of the context has submitted a pull request to enable full RBF by default in Bitcoin Core. They claim that around 40% of the total Bitcoin hash power is mining full RBF replacements across multiple pools. However, only a minority of nodes currently relay full RBF replacements, which poses a barrier to utilizing them in multi-party transactions. The author believes that enabling full RBF by default will address this issue.The context includes references to block explorers, such as blockstream.info and mempool.space, enabling full RBF, nodes running full RBF, multi-party transactions with full RBF, opposition from Bitrefill, removal of non-BIP125-RBF transactions in on-chain wallets, and the value of enabling full RBF by default.</p>
