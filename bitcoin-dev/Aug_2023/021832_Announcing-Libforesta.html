    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Davidson Souza introduced a project called `libfloresta` to the Bitcoin devs mailing list. `Libfloresta` is a derivative of the project `Floresta`, which is an Utreexo powered, Fully-Validating Bitcoin Full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main aim of `libfloresta` is to provide a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for end users, especially on low-power devices like SBCs and smartphones. Davidson is writing the main logic in Rust and generating bindings to the original code and compiling to WASM to make it run virtually anywhere.The project is currently in an early stage but has been used on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be resolved. Davidson encourages users to check out the project on his GitHub page and provides an initial blog post explaining how to use `libfloresta` in Rust. He plans to write more documentation as the project matures and becomes available on other platforms. Feedback is welcome.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to use the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. While this approach doesn't guarantee consistency, it minimizes misimplementations that could lead to splits. Davidson is also cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they become problematic.Davidson expresses gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta.Overall, Davidson Souza introduces `libfloresta`, a project aimed at providing a compact and ready-to-use full node for Bitcoin on low-power devices. He shares his progress, encourages feedback, and clarifies the approach to consensus.</p>
