    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was made to add a first seen safe rule to mitigate the negative impact of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) on merchants and users who accept zero-confirmation transactions. The idea behind this rule is that a transaction can be replaced, but it must include the original outputs.Daniel Lipshitz, representing GAP600, expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users who rely on 0-conf transactions while using mitigation tools like GAP600. He mentioned that their platform has seen strong usage for Bitcoin, with approximately 350k unique transaction hashes requested per month over the last three months. Some of their clients include Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly.To investigate further, it was noted that Coinpayments and Coinspaid are both merchant processors. However, no examples could be found of actual merchants using their platforms that accept unconfirmed payments. Their websites also do not provide any documentation indicating acceptance of unconfirmed transactions.Regarding Changelly, their website explicitly states that they ensure swift transactions with an average speed of 5-40 minutes, which indicates that they do not accept unconfirmed payments. Test transactions were also conducted with BIP125 disabled and a sufficient fee, confirming that unconfirmed payments are not accepted by Changelly. Their exchange flow clearly states that once BTC is confirmed in the blockchain, they will start exchanging it.Based on this investigation, it seems that the lack of impact from full RBF on double spend rates for GAP600's transactions is because they don't actually have clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.In conclusion, there doesn't appear to be a genuine example of an actual merchant accepting unconfirmed transactions as payment and relying on the first-seen behavior.</p>
