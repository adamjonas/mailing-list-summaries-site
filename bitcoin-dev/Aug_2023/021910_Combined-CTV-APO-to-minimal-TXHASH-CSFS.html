The sender acknowledges that this change is a valuable addition.The sender then mentions that if the proposed feature moves forward, they will carefully consider the hash contents for each mode, as indicated in a table provided at the end. They also mention the possibility of having mode 0 (referred to as "CTVish") commit to the spend_type and annex.
