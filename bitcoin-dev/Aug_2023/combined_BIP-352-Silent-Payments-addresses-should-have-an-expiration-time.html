        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Josie expresses gratitude to Peter for his feedback on BIP352 and acknowledges that expiration dates are a general problem in Bitcoin. Instead of proposing expiration dates as part of BIP352, Josie suggests that they should be discussed as their own BIP. Josie raises skepticism about the effectiveness of expiration dates, arguing that they weaken the value of silent payments and do not address the problems described by Peter. Multiple scenarios are presented to support this viewpoint. Instead of expiration dates, Josie suggests allowing users to revoke their silent payment addresses and proposes building a wallet protocol on top of silent payments to facilitate this. The privacy implications of expiration dates are also highlighted. Josie notes that Peter's proposed solution is not enforceable as any wallet can ignore the extra bytes and send to the address/xpub/static payment code regardless. For expiration dates to be useful, they would need to be enforced by consensus, but Josie is uncertain if this is a good idea. Expiration dates are seen as a separate problem beyond the scope of BIP352, but if a more general solution is found, it could potentially be added to a future version of silent payments. The proposal suggests encoding expiration dates with varying levels of granularity, allowing users to encode their expiration dates in 1 or 2 bytes currently, with the flexibility to degrade in the future by requiring additional bytes. This approach avoids the immediate requirement of using 3 bytes and provides a more efficient encoding scheme now. Josie argues that a more secure alternative is needed for non-expiring addresses and proposes a custom compact encoding scheme that indicates the number of extension bytes and the encoded granularity based on the position of the first 0-bit. This scheme includes various byte lengths, each with a different level of granularity and maximum expiration period. It allows for day-based and block-based expiration periods, accommodating both common and precise expiration requirements. The compatibility of block-based expiration with operations like OP_CLTV OP_VAULT_RECOVER or OP_CLTV OP_CHECKSIG is highlighted, making it beneficial for users who need to match CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) values embedded in their scripts. The question of why there is a 180-year limit is raised, suggesting the exploration of reasons behind this time frame. Longer planning horizons may be necessary to address challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and demographic shifts. However, striking a balance between long-term vision and short-term practicality is crucial for effective decision-making. Wallets are not permanent and can be compromised or lost, leading to addresses becoming toxic data. Silent Payments are designed to allow users to safely pay to a single address multiple times without privacy concerns. Adding a 3-byte field to silent payment addresses is proposed, encoding the expiration date in terms of days after a certain epoch. This allows for an expiration period of up to 45,000 years. Alternatively, 2 bytes could be used, allowing for an expiration period of up to 180 years. Setting a reasonable default expiration period for newly created addresses and handling failed transactions for expired addresses ensures usability. Expired silent payment addresses can also be applied to Lightning invoices for a similar user experience. Wallets can provide a safer and more reliable experience for users.</p>
