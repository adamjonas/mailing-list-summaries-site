        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email discusses the issue of expiration dates for Bitcoin addresses, specifically focusing on Silent Payment addresses. It states that if expiration dates are desired, they should be proposed and discussed as their own standard that can work with various address formats. The email then presents several scenarios highlighting potential issues with expiration dates, such as compromised wallets, lost keys, and missed payments. It suggests that a better solution would be to allow users to revoke their silent payment addresses. The email also mentions privacy concerns and the need for expiration dates to be enforceable by consensus. It concludes by stating that expiration dates are a separate problem and not within the scope of the current proposal. Additionally, the email provides information about encoding expiration dates and refers to Peter Todd's website for further resources. Another topic discussed is the issue of granularity in applying limits and suggestions for improvement. The email explains an alternative method using custom compact encoding, allowing for varying levels of granularity and maximum expiration periods. It emphasizes the longevity and security of bitcoin addresses provided by this encoding scheme. The question of why there is a 180-year limit is raised, and different perspectives on planning horizons are presented. Some argue for longer planning horizons to address complex challenges, while others prioritize shorter-term practicality. The email concludes by stating that the choice of planning horizon depends on perspective and context. Lastly, the email addresses the issue of expiration dates for Silent Payment addresses, highlighting the risk of toxic data from compromised or lost wallets. It proposes adding a field to encode the expiration date in days after a certain epoch. It suggests using 3 bytes for a range of 45,000 years or 2 bytes for a range of 180 years. The email recommends setting a default expiration period and failing transactions to expired addresses. Overall, implementing an expiration mechanism for Silent Payment addresses ensures the safety of funds and enhances the user experience.</p>
