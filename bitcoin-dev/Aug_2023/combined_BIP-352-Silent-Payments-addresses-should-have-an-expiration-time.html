        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Silent Payments addresses are at risk of becoming toxic data, resulting in the loss of funds. To address this issue, it is proposed to add a 3-byte field to Silent Payments addresses that encodes the expiration date in terms of days after a specific epoch. The suggested duration is 2^24 days, which is equivalent to 45,000 years. However, even 2 bytes (2^16 days or 180 years) should be sufficient.By including an expiration date, Silent Payments addresses can be reused multiple times without privacy concerns, while ensuring that they eventually expire within a reasonable timeframe. Wallets can set a default expiration date for newly created addresses, such as 1 year, to ensure usability. If someone attempts to pay an expired address, the transaction would fail with a message stating "address expired. "Implementing these changes would prevent the loss of funds and improve the overall functionality of Silent Payments addresses. It is important to consider the longevity of Bitcoin itself when determining the expiration duration.</p>
