        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The ability to trick someone into thinking a new address came from Bob by modifying a donation address is referred to as "updating the expiration". The effectiveness and difficulty of updating an address are questioned, considering the ease of updating social media, webpages, and GitHub repos. Comparisons are made between checksums and expiration in terms of enforcement and effectiveness. It is suggested that implementing an expiration time in payment requests, such as through Silent Payments or a new BIP 21 URI parameter, could solve the issue of address expiration. Josie expresses skepticism about the effectiveness and enforceability of expiration dates and proposes alternative solutions like allowing Bob to revoke his silent payment address or building a wallet protocol on top of silent payments. The granularity of encoding expiration dates is discussed, with the binary representation of the expiration date determining the byte-length and granularity. The historical inventions of practical electric motors and light bulbs are mentioned to highlight the significance of technological advancements. The issue of granularity in applying limits is discussed, suggesting an alternative approach to selecting a useful granularity. Non-expiring addresses pose a risk, and a custom compact encoding scheme is proposed as a secure alternative. The question of why there is a 180-year limit is raised, and advocates for longer planning horizons argue that many significant issues require a perspective beyond 180 years. The choice of a planning horizon involves trade-offs between short-term practicality and long-term vision. Wallets can be compromised or lost, leading to addresses becoming toxic data, and Silent Payments offer a solution for safely paying to a single address multiple times. To avoid mistakes, Silent Payment addresses should eventually expire, and a proposed solution is to add a field encoding the expiration date in terms of days after a certain epoch. Implementing a simple expiration mechanism for Silent Payment addresses is crucial to prevent loss of funds and maintain Bitcoin's integrity.</p>
