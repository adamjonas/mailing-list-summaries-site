    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The question of whether storage for blockchain is sufficiently limited can be answered with a 'yes' based on several factors. In a worst-case scenario, where the maximum block size is 4MB and the block time is 10 minutes, the growth would amount to 210.24GB per year. While some pruning can be done, let's assume no pruning is desired. Currently, the entire blockchain is around 500GB, indicating a significant growth potential. However, considering the current cost of hardware, a 5TB hard drive can be obtained for less than $150, providing storage that would last 21 years before running out of space. This equates to less than $0.02 per day, making it a manageable expense even in the worst-case scenario.Furthermore, it's important to note that the cost of hardware tends to decrease over time, further reducing the burden of storage costs. Additionally, efforts are being made to optimize the amount of data that needs to be stored by individual nodes. One such initiative is Floresta, a node implementation that utilizes utreexo to enable nodes to operate without maintaining the full UTXO set. This optimization potential, along with other initiatives, offers the possibility of significantly reducing the amount of space required by individual nodes. Overall, while the growth potential of blockchain may seem substantial, the combination of affordable hardware and ongoing optimization efforts ensures that storage remains sufficient for practical usage.</p>
