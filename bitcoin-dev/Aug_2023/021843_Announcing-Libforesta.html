    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the project called `libfloresta`, which is a derivate of the project called `Floresta`. `Floresta` is an Utreexo powered, Fully-Validating Bitcoin Full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main goal of `libfloresta` is to create a low-power device-friendly full node for end-users. The project is being developed using Rust and will generate bindings to the original code and compile to WASM, allowing it to run virtually anywhere.The project is in its early stage but has been successfully used on signet. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues that need to be solved with bridge nodes. The project is available on GitHub, and the developer has written an initial blog post explaining how to use it in Rust. Feedback is welcomed.It is clarified that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. It uses `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to use the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future to minimize misimplementations leading to splits. Cross-testing against Bitcoin Core is being done to find any inconsistencies before they cause trouble.The developer acknowledges Vinteum for supporting their work with utreexo and Floresta.In the discussion, various aspects of `libfloresta` are addressed. Firstly, it is pointed out that the utreexo bridge peers are not the only real Bitcoin nodes. Floresta is mentioned as a Compact State Node (CSN) that performs everything a bridge or regular node does but with different storage and I/O requirements. CSNs are the reason why utreexo is relevant. The consensus parts are implemented using Core's set of shared libs, and the chain is validated from genesis as usual.The misconception that one can't use -only- libfloresta to be a node is corrected. Bridge nodes can be eliminated in theory, but the goal is to create a drop-in replacement for a node + EPS with Floresta. Technically, mining can be done with libfloresta by building a block dispatcher, but it is out of scope for the project's main target, which is end-users who may not want or be able to use a node due to hardware requirements. Normal transactions cannot be built with libfloresta, but the goal is to integrate the node and (if needed) the watch-only wallet in a wallet that implements these procedures.The confusion regarding why web browsers are being targeted is addressed. The goal is to create a fully validating node with a small footprint so that even browsers and smartphones can run an actual node. Browsers are just one possible target, and even big computers would benefit from a low-footprint node.Overall, `libfloresta` aims to provide a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for Bitcoin users on low-power devices, with bindings generated to run virtually anywhere. It utilizes existing libraries for consensus and cross-tests against Bitcoin Core to ensure consistency. The project is in its early stage but has been used successfully on signet, and feedback is welcomed.</p>
