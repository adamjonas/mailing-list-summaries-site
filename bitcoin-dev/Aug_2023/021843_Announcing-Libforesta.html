    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Davidson Souza, the developer of Floresta, introduces a project called libfloresta to the Bitcoin developers mailing list. Libfloresta is a derivative of Floresta, which is an Utreexo powered, fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The goal of libfloresta is to provide a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for end users, particularly on low-power devices like single-board computers (SBCs) and smartphones. To achieve this, the main logic of libfloresta is being written in Rust, with bindings generated to the original code and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), allowing it to run virtually anywhere.Although the project is still in its early stages, Davidson has been using it on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues that need to be resolved with bridge nodes and setting them up as utreexo peers. The libfloresta project is available on Davidson's GitHub repository, and he has also written an initial blogpost explaining how to use it in Rust. He plans to write more as the project matures and gets running on other platforms, and welcomes feedback from the community.Davidson clarifies that libfloresta does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using libbitcoinconsensus and plans to use the full libbitcoinkernel in the future. This approach minimizes the risk of inconsistencies and splits. Davidson is also cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any potential inconsistencies before they cause trouble.Davidson expresses his gratitude to Vinteum for supporting his work with utreexo and Floresta.</p>
