    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Hi Dave, Based on the information provided, you are looking for the exact location of a proposal. The link provided, Merkle.fun, directs to a comment labeled as "WIP" (work in progress), which mentions OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY. However, your description above refers to "core opcodes" in plural form, indicating that there might be more to it than what is mentioned in the comment. This discrepancy has left you feeling uncertain about whether the mentioned comment is indeed the "complete proposal" you were expecting. You were anticipating a draft BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) when you read about a "complete proposal." It seems like you are unsure if the WIP comment on Merkle.fun is the comprehensive proposal you are searching for since it only mentions OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY and does not match your expectation of multiple core opcodes.</p>
