    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Peter Todd and Russell O'Connor discussed the possibility of solving the problem of replacing transactions that have been offered a new transaction with a higher fee rate. Todd expressed his belief that it is not possible to solve this issue because someone has already consumed network bandwidth that should be paid for with fees. He stated that any attempt to replace a transaction without paying those fees would be vulnerable to attack and likened it to what an attacker would try to do. However, he did mention that if the attack isn't significant enough, it may not matter. O'Connor agreed with Todd's assessment but still believes that pursuing the proposed change in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policy is worthwhile as the current policy is problematic in practice for normal transactions.</p>
