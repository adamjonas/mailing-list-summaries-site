    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj responded to a question about the use of Bulletproof Confidential Transactions (CT) in an election. He mentioned that MimbleWimble works under the assumption that the sender needs to reveal some secrets to the receiver, and the receiver will then know if it received 0 or 1 coin from that sender. ZmnSCPxj believes that if voters send vote-coins directly to "The Party," then "The Party" knows the votes of particular voters, and may then dispatch subcontractors to dispatch those voters. However, there is a possibility that aggregators/mixers can be used to obscure the source of coins. In any case sending directly from the tx of the Voting Authority to another tx to the selected party would let The Party members who secretly control the Voting Authority records to figure out which voters got which txouts of the Voting Authority. Jose Femenias Canuelo initiated the discussion by sharing his thoughts on the use of Bulletproof CT in an election. Jose suggested that the Voting Authority should send a coin (1 coin = 1 vote) to each citizen above 18. Later on, each voter sends her coin to her preferred party, as part of a Bulletproof CT, along with 0 coins to other parties to disguise her vote. In the end, each party will accrue as many votes as coins received. Jose asked if there are any missing features required in Bulletproof to support this use case.</p>
