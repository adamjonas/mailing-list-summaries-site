        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Daniel Robinson is exploring Peter Todd's client-side verified single-use-seals via proof-of-publication model, which creates an anti-double-spend primitive. The model requires a proof-of-publication and many proofs-of-non-publication to verify that a seal is closed correctly. To create a system using this model, Daniel is looking at what Merkle-tree-like structure for the "transaction root" would best allow efficient proofs of non-inclusion in a block. Peter Todd suggests a bitfield where each possible value under that node is represented by a single bit. In this method, the marginal size of the non-inclusion proof is m bits, where m values are under that point in the tree. This new method competes against a Merkle tree built from a hash function with k bits, which takes approximately k*log2(m) bits to prove non-inclusion. Peter Todd introduces a new type of inner node that commits to a merkle-mountain-range (MMR) tip and a 2^j element bitfield. However, he discusses the challenge of choosing when to use a bitfield-based inner node instead of a standard one. Assuming keys are randomly distributed, it makes sense to do so when the bitfield table is partially empty, but how empty? It's a trade-off between multiple parameters, including the size of proofs-of-publication. Although the latter may be OK to ignore as the number of proof-of-non-publication needed should usually greatly outnumber proofs-of-publication.For a proof-of-publication to be secure, it must ensure that any attempt to construct a false proof-of-non-publication will fail. In the pruning model, a proof-of-publication is simply the data necessary for the proof-of-non-publication verifier to return false. Peter Todd suggests that using probabilistic data structures such as bloom filters may be more space-efficient than a bitfield.</p>
