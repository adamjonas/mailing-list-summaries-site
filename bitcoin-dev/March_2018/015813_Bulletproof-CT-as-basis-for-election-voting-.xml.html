    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Tim and JOSE FEMENIAS CAÃ‘UELO is about the potential use of blockchain in electronic voting. Tim points out that homomorphic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs have been used in e-voting for quite some time and a bulletin board is required to store ballots. While a blockchain can be helpful in some specific cases, it may not be necessary in all cases. He suggests reading literature on e-voting, including a paper on blockchains and e-voting. JOSE proposes a simple implementation for e-voting using Bulletproof Confidential Transactions to hide the amount transferred, where each citizen is issued a coin representing a vote and voters send their coins to their preferred party. Tim does not point out any specific issues with JOSE's proposal but suggests discussing such topics elsewhere.</p>
