    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, Peter Todd expressed his opinion that it is not possible to solve the problem of unconfirmed payments. Specifically, he was referring to the case where Alice resends her unconfirmed payment. He believes that an attack aimed at replacing a transaction without paying fees would be just as vulnerable as not having any protection in place at all. Todd suggests that solving this issue may not be of great importance and could be tolerated. Russell O'Connor had asked Todd for clarification on whether he meant there was a specific problem with a proposal to replace transactions when offered a new transaction whose fee rate exceeds the package fee rate of the original transaction or if there was another issue he foresees.</p>
