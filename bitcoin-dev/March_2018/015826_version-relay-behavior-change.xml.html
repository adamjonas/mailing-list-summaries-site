    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eric Voskuil reported on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list that /Satoshi:0.15.0/ and later nodes appear to be no longer honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37). Andrew Chow responded, suggesting that it might be a bug rather than an intentional change and asked for specific details to reproduce the problem. Eric replied that he had reviewed the relevant Core sources and did not see any issue. They also synced against a Core node locally and did not observe the problem. However, they suspected it was Core since it was very common and all of the User Agents were consistent. The behavior started infrequently with 0.14.0 peers and has become more common over time. Eric wondered what fork would report as Core and be that common, and suggested reinstating the behavior of dropping peers who did this for protocol noncompliance.</p>
