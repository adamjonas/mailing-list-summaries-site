        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Eric Voskuil raised concerns about nodes that no longer seem to be honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37) in /Satoshi:0.15.0/ and later versions of Bitcoin Core. Andrew Chow responded, suggesting that these nodes may not actually be forked from Bitcoin Core, but rather fake nodes that do not follow the protocol or perform verification. These fake nodes can set any user agent they want, including Bitcoin Core's user agents. Despite reviewing the relevant Core sources and syncing against a Core node locally, Voskuil still suspects that this behavior is related to Core, as it is very common and all user agents are consistent.Voskuil does not see any issues with Core sources or his own flag and version settings. However, he has previously dropped peers for noncompliance with the protocol and is considering reinstating this behavior. It is unclear whether this behavior is intentional or a bug, and specific details on how to reproduce the issue have been requested.In summary, Eric Voskuil reported on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that nodes running /Satoshi:0.15.0/ and later versions are not honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37). Andrew Chow suggested that these nodes may be fake and not actually connected to Bitcoin Core, while Voskuil suspects that the behavior is related to Core due to its commonness and consistent user agents. The cause of this behavior, whether intentional or a bug, remains unclear, and further details have been requested to reproduce the issue.</p>
