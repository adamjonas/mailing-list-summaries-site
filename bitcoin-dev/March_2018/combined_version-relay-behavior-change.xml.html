        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Eric Voskuil posted on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list that Satoshi:0.15.0 nodes were no longer honoring the version.relay=false flag (BIP37). Andrew Chow responded saying that he did not think that behavior had changed, and suggested that Eric might be connected to fake nodes that don't actually follow the protocol. Eric stated that they had synced against a Core node locally and reviewed relevant Core sources, so he didn't see any problem. He suspected it was Core because all user agents were consistent except for occasional exceptions for forked nodes. Andrew suggested that if what Eric was seeing was true, it is likely a bug and not an intentional change, and asked for specific details on how to reproduce. Eric said that this behavior started infrequently with 0.14.0 peers and has become more common over time. Eric is considering reinstating the behavior of dropping peers for protocol noncompliance.</p>
