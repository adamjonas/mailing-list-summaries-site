        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Daniel R, an intermediate programmer with knowledge of Python, C/C++, and Java, is eager to contribute to Bitcoin Core. He has already cloned the git repository and seeks guidance on learning more about the structure of Bitcoin Core. Additionally, Daniel wants to work on specific problems that will allow him to gain experience with the source code. With a strong understanding of cryptographic concepts and procedures, Daniel is also teaching himself math related to elliptic curves.Ryan, offering direction to Daniel, suggests starting with simple and seemingly mundane changes to organically develop a better understanding of Bitcoin Core. Ryan recommends visiting <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls</a> to find issues, reproduce the problem, test potential fixes, and learn from others' solutions. According to Ryan, there is a significant demand for practical problem-solving skills, rather than advanced mathematics, in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space.Notably, while Daniel pursues his goal of contributing to Bitcoin Core, he is concurrently working on his bachelor thesis. The thesis focuses on exploring the utilization of blockchain technology in the car industry, meticulously analyzing various aspects of protocol design.</p>
