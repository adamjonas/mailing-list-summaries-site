    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin's Replace-by-Fee (RBF) policy, Russell O'Connor suggested that replaced transactions should require a fee increase of at least the min-fee-rate times the size of all the transactions being ejected. Peter Todd raised concerns about weakening anti-DoS protections, but O'Connor clarified that he was not suggesting removing them entirely. The issue of institutional wallets sweeping unconfirmed outputs was also discussed as they seem to be happy to sweep unconfirmed outputs, which is potentially problematic. Additionally, there was a discussion about miner incentives and developing a reasonable standard RBF policy that aligns with those incentives. There was some disagreement about whether miners and full nodes have slightly different priorities. Nonetheless, Todd agreed to try the new replacement behavior in a release and see what happens. If people use this new replacement behavior, it may discourage institutions from sweeping unconfirmed outputs, which can be dangerous in reorgs.</p>
