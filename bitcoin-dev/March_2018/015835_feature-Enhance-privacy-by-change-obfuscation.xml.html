    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core has introduced an 'Enhanced privacy' option for transaction creation, which enhances privacy by change obfuscation. The feature allows the user to randomly distribute change across up to twenty output addresses (minimum five), as long as each output is not dust. It is suggested that the total random number of addresses to distribute to should be limited by change amount. Additional inputs can be selected if available to increase change, although this may eventually result in a decrease in obfuscation in some cases when the outputs are spent. However, the transaction cost will be higher for the initial spend with the change due to increased outputs and possibly for later spending the change depending on the future spend amount(s) and the number of inputs required.Although transaction linkage is still possible, it is far more difficult to guess what was retained by the owner of the originating utxo's unless the new change outputs are spent together in the same transaction. Overall, the 'Enhanced privacy' option provides an improved level of privacy for Bitcoin Core users.</p>
