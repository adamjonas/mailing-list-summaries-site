    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Russell O'Connor proposed a change in RBF policy, but Peter Todd argued that solving this problem is impossible because it opens up an attack by relaxing anti-DoS protections. Todd stated that normal users creating issues does not happen often and can be avoided by skipping the use of RBF replacements if someone spends an unconfirmed output that was sent to them. He also pointed out that the argument of normal users not attacking each other has nothing to do with the issue at hand and that any protection scheme will be as vulnerable to attack as not having protection in the first place. Ultimately, Todd suggested that the attack may not be important enough to matter.</p>
