    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A programmer named Daniel R wants to contribute to Bitcoin Core. He has intermediate programming skills and knowledge of cryptographic concepts and procedures. He knows Python, C/C++, and a bit of Java. He is currently working on a bachelor thesis about Blockchain usage in the car-industry. He asked for direction regarding sources where he can learn more about the structure of Bitcoin Core and specific problems where he can gain experience working with the source code. Ryan suggested starting with simple and boring changes and organically gaining a better understanding. He also recommended going to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls</a> to find issues, reproduce the problem, test the fix, and look at how the person did it. Ryan believes that there's a lot more demand for elbow grease than advanced maths stuff in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.</p>
