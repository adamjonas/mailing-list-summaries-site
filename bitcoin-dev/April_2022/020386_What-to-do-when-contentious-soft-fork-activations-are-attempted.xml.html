    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post, Michael Folkson discusses the recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork on Bitcoin and raises the issue for discussion of what should be done differently if it is tried again in the future. He questions whether the attempt worked as designed or if we were all woefully unprepared for it. He believes that it is totally unacceptable for one individual to bring the entire Bitcoin network to the brink of a chain split and there has to be a personal cost to dissuade them from trying it again. Folkson expresses his uncertainty about the matter and requests thoughts from others. He acknowledges that Bitcoin is a permissionless network and no authority can stop things like this from happening again. However, he hopes that people will actively resist such attempts and prevent the network from being fundamentally broken. Folkson expresses gratitude to those who expressed concerns publicly and engaged with the conversation on the topic. He also mentions that if an individual can go directly to miners to get soft forks activated bypassing technical concerns from many developers, bypassing Bitcoin Core and bypassing users, then Bitcoin is fundamentally broken. Folkson provides links to his previous posts highlighting the dangers of such attempts.</p>
