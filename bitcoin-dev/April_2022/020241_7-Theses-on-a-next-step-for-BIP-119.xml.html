    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Folkson, a member of the Bitcoin community, responded to a message from Robin Linus regarding covenant enabling proposals and specifically CheckTemplateVerify (CTV). Folkson explained that although he has looked into CTV several times, he is not convinced that it is the best tool for any of its intended use cases. He also stated that if someone wants to change the consensus rules, it is up to them to get community review and consensus. He added that there are other alternative proposals to CTV that people are working on, but they do not support an upcoming activation of CTV. Linus criticized Folkson for not contributing anything tangible to progress on covenants, while Jeremy has been investing a lot of time, work, and patience in his contributions to covenant enabling proposals such as CTV. Linus argued that pointless activation drama is a huge issue in Bitcoin protocol development and can be draining for developers. He urged Folkson to work on what he thinks is the right path forward rather than just criticizing Jeremy's work.  Folkson did not respond further and expressed his intention to focus on FROST, which is Taproot related, until there is clear community consensus for a future soft fork.</p>
