    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is scrambling to prepare for a Speedy Trial signaling period for a CTV soft fork planned to start on May 5th, which has angered and surprised some people who oppose the activation. The Bitcoin Core 23.0 release candidate does not include any CTV code or activation code, and if a miner runs this version out of the box, it will not signal for CTV. However, it is possible that CTV could activate through another software release, in which case Bitcoin Core releases would not apply CTV rules but also wouldn't reject blocks that apply CTV rules. In response, Michael Folkson has tentatively labeled the effort a User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF), but he is open to better names and encourages those who dislike or oppose UASFs to contribute. He has set up a ##ursf channel on Libera IRC to monitor developments and discuss working on an additional release that may ultimately reject blocks that signal for CTV. The goal is to provide additional direction and incentive to miners that the community does not want this soft fork to be activated. Folkson acknowledges that this is not how Bitcoin consensus changes should be attempted and cautions against rushing the process.</p>
