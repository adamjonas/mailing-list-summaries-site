    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is debating the best way to measure user support for proposed soft-fork changes. One proposal involves allowing transactions themselves to signal for upgrade, with a mapping between free bits in the transaction version field and signaling bits in the block header. Under this scheme, a user could influence miner decisions by making their fee active economic pressure for miners to signal in the affirmative or negative. While some may view this as "pay to play," the proposal would be measurable en-protocol and would not require trust in institutions that fork futures. The biggest question posed to the forum is whether such a scheme affords a better view into consensus than the current system of miner signaling.</p>
