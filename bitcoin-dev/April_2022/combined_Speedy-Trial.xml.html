        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list recently had a lively discussion about the need for a mechanism to prevent "evil forks." Jorge Timón argued that such a mechanism was necessary, while Anthony Towns disagreed and stated that rejecting bad premises would be a better solution. The article also talks about the possibility of a hashrate veto as a way to protest against proposed changes and the consequences of a hard fork in Bitcoin's network. The author believes that a hard fork may be the best choice if Bitcoin fails in the future due to factors like complacency or adherence to outdated dogma.The email thread discussed various aspects related to the activation of soft forks in Bitcoin. The discussion covered the differences between BIP8 and speedy trial, hypothetical cases where flawed proposals make it through activation parameters, and how users can coordinate to have a proposal never activated in their chains.Ultimately, the context emphasizes the importance of resolving issues through communication and finding problems with proposals while they are being discussed rather than waiting until after activation. The author stresses the need to avoid drastic measures that may cause irretrievable loss of funds from other bitcoiners.</p>
