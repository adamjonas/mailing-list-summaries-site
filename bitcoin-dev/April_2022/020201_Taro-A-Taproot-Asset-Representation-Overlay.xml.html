    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposes "miner-based commitments" as a possible solution to increase the benefit of adding commitments to Taproot outputs. A mechanism could be created for standardized miner-based commitments, such as having a sorted merkle tree of commitments. However, the author acknowledges that users cannot control miner-based commitments and stresses the need for a payment mechanism for miners to include commitments. ZmnSCPxj suggests implementing `OP_BRIBE` from Drivechains to offer payments. In contrast, using existing mechanisms such as transactions that implicitly pay fees might be better for privacy and censorship-resistance. The author also notes that multiple users could aggregate their data to make a sum commitment and make a single transaction that pays for the privilege of committing to the sum commitment.</p>
