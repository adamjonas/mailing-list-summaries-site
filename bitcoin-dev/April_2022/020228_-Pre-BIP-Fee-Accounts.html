    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses various topics related to blockchain technology. Jeremy Rubin apologizes for any confusion caused by marketing schemes regarding the concept of "blockchain schemes as world computers." The importance of technical materials and their impact on journalists and scammers is also mentioned. The discussion then moves on to whether the progress made in committing data is useless or not, and it is concluded that even if progress is not maximally useful, it is still progress. The technical specification of Open Timestamps is discussed, and it is suggested that explanatory materials with graphics would be helpful. The idea of having a chain of transactions to linearize the history of OTS commitments is also discussed. Finally, an opinion is expressed regarding fee accounts implementation, suggesting that it should be opt-in.</p>
