    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation begins with someone expressing uncertainty about their technical ability to comment on a certain point related to tennis. The topic then shifts to technical arguments against a proposed change in consensus rules for Bitcoin, called CTV. One of the main arguments against it is that there is no clear consensus for the change. Other arguments include that another proposed change, called APO, is better suited for a certain aspect of the system, and that CTV lacks recursion. However, some argue that TLUV is better for certain use cases than CTV. Overall, no one seems to think CTV is "bad," but there are concerns about its suitability for certain scenarios. It is noted that if resources were unlimited, it would be possible to evaluate all proposals on an equal footing.</p>
