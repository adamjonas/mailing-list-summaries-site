    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Darosior proposed the use of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT in place of CTV. They asked for people's sentiment about doing a slightly tweaked version of BIP118 before or instead of BIP119. Darosior argued that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT has been discussed for over six years and presents proven and implemented use cases that are demanded and more widely accepted than CTV's. They suggested that CTV could be considered an optimization of APO-AS covenants if its "ANYONECANPAY" behavior is made optional. Darosior also noted that several applications, such as eltoo, blind statechains, and spacechains, could leverage ANYPREVOUT. Pushd disagreed with Darosior's proposal, calling it premature and stating that they do not find the use cases interesting. They also pointed out that not enough documentation, pull requests, and testing tools are available for BIP118.</p>
