    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition results are expected to be published soon. The last reply on the thread predicted that the results would be out by the end of March, but it seems like they will now be published by the end of April. Both NTRU and NTRU Prime made it to round three for the public key encryption/exchange and digital signature categories, but there is some patent controversy surrounding them currently. Meanwhile, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev suggested implementing a similar address type (secp26k1+NTRU) and associated validation as a soft fork, which would allow people to opt-in to quantum safe addresses. However, it would require a lot of work and extra validation for nodes, so adding a fee premium for using these addresses could be a reasonable solution. While some are in favor of this idea, others believe it is too premature.</p>
