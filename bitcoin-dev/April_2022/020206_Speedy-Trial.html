    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange between Anthony Towns and Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev, the discussion revolves around the issue of blocking a fork in Bitcoin. Jorge argues that any approach that allows blocking of an evil fork, even when everyone else doesn't agree it's evil, would also allow an enemy of Bitcoin to block a good fork that everyone recognizes is good. He suggests that any solution that works for an implausible hypothetical and breaks when a single attacker decides to take advantage of it is not a good design.Anthony disagrees with Jorge's argument and states that bip8/lot=true is better than speedy trial in cases where a flawed proposal makes it through getting activation parameters set and released but doesn't achieve supermajority hashpower support. Anthony explains that bip8/lot=true is advantageous because of its "trial" part, where activation can fail, and you can go back to the drawing board without having to get everyone to upgrade a second time, and also the "speedy" part, where you don't have to wait a year or more before you know what's going to happen.The conversation then proceeds to an alternative hypothetical scenario where someone being able to block a change is undesirable. They discuss a case where an enemy of Bitcoin tries to stop a good idea despite most of Bitcoin being enthusiastically behind it. However, Anthony clarifies that his initial statement was not directed towards Jorge, but rather intended to be the simplest possible case of where someone being able to block a change is undesirable.Jorge feels like his concerns are not being addressed and ends the conversation, stating that he is tired of trying to explain and that they seem to understand different things by "addressing concerns."</p>
