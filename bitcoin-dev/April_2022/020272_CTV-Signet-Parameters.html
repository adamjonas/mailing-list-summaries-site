    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the use of bare CTV outputs in James O'Beirne's simple-ctv-vault, which may suggest that it was not tested on signet. Anthony Towns points out that the purpose of testing is to identify bugs like "wouldn't be broadcastable since it's nonstandard," and argues that if these ideas are still in the preliminary stages, and no one is interested enough to make them consistent with proposed consensus and policy rules, it's premature to change those rules. The conversation then moves to the potential benefits of bare CTV, which only saves bytes when spending, but may be beneficial in certain scenarios involving multiple customer tiers. However, Towns notes that the closest thing to real user data suggests that nobody will benefit from bare CTV. Finally, the group discusses the possibility of using OP_SUCCESSx in segwitv0 CTV, but ultimately decides that if someone desires new features, they may need to upgrade old hardware that cannot support them.</p>
