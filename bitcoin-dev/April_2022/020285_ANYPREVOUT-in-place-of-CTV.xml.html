    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin Protocol Discussion mailing list has suggested using (a slightly tweaked version of) BIP118 instead of BIP119, and is seeking feedback on the idea. The person argues that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, which has been discussed for over 6 years, presents proven and implemented use cases that are demanded and more widely accepted than CTV's. They propose that CTV can be emulated just fine with SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT if its "ANYONECANPAY" behavior is made optional. However, they note that there is not enough documentation or pull requests available for BIP118, and not enough tools for testing. Additionally, since Taproot soft fork was recently activated, it may be too soon to consider another soft fork. The author suggests that BIP118 could benefit more (if not most of) Bitcoin users in the meantime, and asks whether people would oppose APO-AS part of BIP118, since it enables CTV's features, for the same reason they'd oppose BIP119.</p>
