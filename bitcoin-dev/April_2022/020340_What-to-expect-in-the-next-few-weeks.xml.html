    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the need to add a seed node set to peer with other forkd runners and ensure that forkd is responsible for adding them. The conversation also touches upon the concept of Nuclear Deterrence game theory and how it relates to the current situation. The use of scripts to support a URSF validation requirement is discussed, and the advantages of a separate binary release versus a binary + script are debated. The challenges of handling a chain split are highlighted, including the risk of ending up isolated and the need to split coins across different chains. The limitations of forkd in addressing all the problems that a chain split would create are acknowledged, and it is suggested that changes should only be made with caution and consensus.</p>
