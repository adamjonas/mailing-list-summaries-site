        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jonas Nick, along with Tim Ruffing and Elliott Jin, has proposed a new MuSig2 BIP that is compatible with BIP340 public keys and signatures. This new BIP supports tweaking, which allows deriving BIP32 child keys from aggregate keys and creating BIP341 Taproot outputs with key and script paths. The draft BIP is available on GitHub and can be used to write an implementation based on the BIP that passes the basic test vectors. It also contains a reference implementation in Python. However, it should be noted that this is only a draft, and there may still be necessary tweaks to the algorithms and test vectors.One developer has made a pull request to add JSON test vectors to make it easier for other implementations to integrate existing vectors and update them as needed. They have been following the BIP for a few months and have been updating their implementation for `btcsuite/btcd` in lockstep. They commended the authors' approach in specifying more performant and safe algorithms while supporting both normal and x-only tweaks.The developer also mentioned that their team has been integrating their implementation into lnd to get more familiar with the proposed API and crafting real transactions that use musig2 in the wild. They hope to cut a release next month (lnd v0.15.0) that includes an experimental API intended to give developers safe access to musig2 signing and key aggregation. They have concurrently started working on a proposal for a new taproot native LN channel type that natively uses musig2 where applicable.The developer also discussed a case that the BIP doesn't touch on, which is something any implementation will need to account for if they wish to support the two signing modes that are mentioned. They noted that in order to support signing for a key that uses BIP 86 derivation or an external key that commits to a tapscript root, an implementation must make the pre-tweaked combined key available to the caller. They also explained how they handle this case in their implementation.Finally, the developer asked Jonas Nick to elaborate on a fragment of the BIP that describes a "shortcut" when a specific signer is meant to send their nonces last. The developer's reading was that if there's a signer that will always send their nonce last, then they don't actually need to generate real randomness and can just fully specify all the new optional arguments.</p>
