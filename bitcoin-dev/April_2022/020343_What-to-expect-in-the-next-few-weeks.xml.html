    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A mailing list post was not made regarding a potential plan for the CTV Bitcoin Client because it was offered up for discussion to a public working group for feedback and was not a committed plan. On April 17th, Jeremy Rubin posted on his personal blog that software builds for the client would be available within a week, but he clarified in the mailing list that this was not a committed plan and that there was no clear next step yet. Michael Folkson expressed skepticism that the soft fork activation attempt would obtain community consensus and warned against rushing into running things without understanding the implications. He also criticized Rubin for his past suggestions, including the Binance hack rollback and the NACKing then coin flip suggestion on Taproot activation. Folkson urged the community to pay attention and make informed decisions, while Rubin defended himself by saying that the correct set of check and balance tools were made available and asked for specific feedback on the advantages of a separate binary release rather than a binary + script that can handle both cases.</p>
