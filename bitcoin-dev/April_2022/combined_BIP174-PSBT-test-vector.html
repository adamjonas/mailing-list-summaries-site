        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Tobin Harding recently reached out to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, seeking assistance with parsing the extended private key seed from the BIP174 test vector. He explained that he was in the process of implementing the test vector PSBT workflow in Rust and had encountered an issue with generating the extended private key using the provided seed. Harding provided links to the BIP174 specification and the specific section of the workflow where the seed was required. In order to give context, he included the xpriv and seed values from the test vector. However, despite his attempts to decode the seed as both base64 and base58, he was still unable to create the extended private key.In response to Tobin's query, Achow101 clarified that the seed is actually encoded as a WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key. Decoding it as a WIF key will yield the 32 byte seed, which can then be used according to the specifications outlined in BIP 32.Andrew also chimed in on the email thread, confirming this information.</p>
