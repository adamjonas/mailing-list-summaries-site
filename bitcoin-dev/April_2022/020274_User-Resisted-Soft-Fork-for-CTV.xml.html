    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Keagan McClelland suggested that finding ways to activate non-invasive changes should be everyone's goal, even if they personally may not have an immediate use case. However, Zac argues that any change that increases the number of use cases of Bitcoin affects all users and is not non-invasive. This is because more blockchain usage will increase the price of a transaction for everyone. Zac believes that any change made to Bitcoin must benefit all users, as per Peter Todd's maxim. To achieve this, every change must have well-defined and transparent benefits. He further suggests that the only additions to the protocol that would still be acceptable are those that clearly benefit layer 2 solutions such as LN and do not carry the dangerous potential of getting abused by freeloaders selling commercial services on top of "free" eternal storage on the blockchain.</p>
