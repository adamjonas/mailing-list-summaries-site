    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On a forum post, Jeremy Rubin suggests that while reverting Segwit is impossible, it is possible to do an additional softfork. This would either weigh witness data at the full 4 WU/Byte rate or reduce the total weight limit so as to extend the witness discount to non-Segwit transactions. However, someone points out that such a move could lead to confiscation of funds if the increase in weight made the transaction invalid. In response, Jeremy says that it would be absurd to make such a spending condition, and all soft forks would have to be ruled out if this were the case. The conversation then moves on to the variant of Speedy Trial being used, which according to Jeremy is only meant to sabotage parallel UASF efforts. When asked why he didn't upstream the code that was used for actual activation, he says that the patches were done, reviewed, and deployed in time for Taproot. Luke then accuses Jeremy of sabotaging efforts to get it merged into Core, violating the community's trust in it by instead merging his BIP9 ST without consensus.</p>
