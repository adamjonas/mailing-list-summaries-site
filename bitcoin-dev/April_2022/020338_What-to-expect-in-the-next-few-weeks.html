    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are various discussions going on about the contentious CTV soft fork and its activation parameters. The formal critiques of CTV, also known as the "3 NACKs," are largely based on whether or not to swing the racquet in tennis, rather than if one should be at the ball. There is skepticism about obtaining community consensus over the next three months for this soft fork activation attempt, which has been postponed from May 5th to August 1st, 2022. Michael Folkson urges those interested in Bitcoin's consensus rules to pay attention and make informed decisions on what software to run and support. In particular, he recommends listening to trusted individuals who were around in 2015-2017 and being cautious of motivated parties who may seek to take advantage of a contentious soft fork activation attempt. Folkson emphasizes transparency and ample time to research and prepare before making decisions on what software to run. He also encourages users to rely on the status quo and tried and trusted options like Bitcoin Core when in doubt.
