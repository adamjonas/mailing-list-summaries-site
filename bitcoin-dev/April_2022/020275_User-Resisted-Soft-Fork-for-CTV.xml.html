    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Folkson, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed his opposition to the attempt to activate the CTV soft fork without community consensus. He argues that Bitcoin's consensus rules define the cryptocurrency and should only be changed with community consensus. If soft forks are activated without consensus, it sets a precedent for future proposals to be activated regardless of community support. Folkson also mentions that once consensus rules are changed, they generally require a hard fork to revert. He believes that decentralized decision making requires high bars when considering changes to the most important and dangerous part of Bitcoin. Folkson responds to Keagan McClelland's argument that resisting changes that do not affect you is not consistent with the ideals of freedom. Folkson argues that the CTV proposal does not have community consensus and that attempting to activate it anyway is not how Bitcoin consensus changes should be attempted. He points out that prominent developers such as Matt Corallo, Adam Back, Murch, Bob McElrath were against attempting the activation. Folkson labels the effort to prevent the attempted CTV soft fork activation a User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF). The URSF would monitor developments and discuss working on an additional release that may ultimately reject blocks that signal for CTV. This would provide additional direction and incentive to miners that the community does not want this soft fork to be activated. Folkson emphasizes that running a Bitcoin Core release will not signal for a CTV soft fork out of the box, and if a miner runs a Bitcoin Core release, it will not signal for CTV.</p>
