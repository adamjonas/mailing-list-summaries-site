    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his support for the Consensus-enforced Transaction Validity (CTV) proposal. He stated that CTV could benefit layer 2 users and is simple to implement. With a pure `OP_CTV` SCRIPT on a P2WSH / P2SH, only 32 bytes + change on the output and 32 bytes + change on the input/witness are required. In contrast, signature-based schemes require at least 32 bytes + change on the output and 64 bytes + change on the witness if they use the Taproot format. ZmnSCPxj believes that hashes used by `OP_CTV` are CPU-cheaper and memory-cheaper than even highly-optimized `libsecp256k1` signature validation. Moreover, he thinks that recursive covenants deserve more general research and thinking before enabling them. ZmnSCPxj views `OP_CTV` as the "AND" to the "OR" of MAST. Both cases involve a hash-based tree, but in `OP_CTV`, all pre-agreed cases are required, while in MAST, only one is needed. Although other proposals, such as SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, could benefit L2 solutions more, they are signature-based and would be larger in this niche.</p>
