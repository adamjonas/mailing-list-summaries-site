    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread, Jeremy Rubin outlined three questions that can be used as a guide to determine if a new feature proposal is ready for implementation. He suggested testing whether transactions can be made using the new feature with bitcoin-cli, other libraries, and most common libraries. Additionally, Rubin asked if anyone had created usable prototypes of major use cases for the new feature. Using these criteria, Rubin argued that CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) has not yet met the standards for being considered sufficiently tested, as there are still no usable prototypes of the major use cases for CTV.Despite this, Rubin acknowledged that CTV has been used in many different ways and highlighted Sapio as an example of how CTV can be used for a diverse set of applications. However, the use cases for CTV are targeted for long-term store of value rather than a medium of exchange and measured in decades rather than minutes or days. While people may be excited about these use cases, there is no rush to implement them and demo them on the CTV signet that already exists.According to Rubin, an unbiased observer would expect to see a toy implementation of eltoo using ANYPREVOUT, which could handle fees and layered transactions. However, it will take some time to update LN to taproot and PTLCs, so eltoo is not on the immediate horizon. Additionally, TLUV's design parameters do not seem optimal, and alternatives like OP_EVICT are still on the whiteboard.Overall, Rubin suggests that there is no need to rush to adapt consensus to these use cases until they are fully fleshed out and can be demonstrated in public.</p>
