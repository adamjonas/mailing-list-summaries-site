    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on April 24, 2022, Jorge Tim√≥n expressed his concern that the consideration of user resistance was missing in certain cases. In response, AJ Towns reiterated his claim that activating a bad softfork using bip8 is never superior to speedy trial and sometimes worse. He challenged anyone who disagreed with him to present a single example where he was wrong. AJ further explained that bip8 with lot=true is only worse than speedy trial when miners correctly see that a bad fork is bad. Otherwise, both methods are the same. He noted that any resistance method that works against bip8 also works against speedy trial, and if it fails against speedy trial, it also fails against bip8. Jorge apologized for his aggressive tone but expressed frustration when people repeatedly ignore some of his points. In response, AJ suggested that Jorge examine the beam in his own eye.</p>
