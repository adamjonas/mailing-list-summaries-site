    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a post to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list is proposing a tweaked version of BIP118, which they argue could be a more useful and efficient alternative to CTV. The author notes that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT can emulate CTV, albeit with some additional costs and limitations, and suggests that it could be considered an optimization of APO-AS covenants. While the author acknowledges some potential drawbacks to APO, such as concerns over quantum computing and higher witness satisfaction costs, they argue that these issues have already been addressed and that the benefits of APO outweigh the costs. The author suggests that if APO proves to be successful and widely adopted, CTV could still be rolled out as an optimization. Overall, the author proposes that BIP118 is a soft fork candidate that could benefit more Bitcoin users than BIP119.</p>
