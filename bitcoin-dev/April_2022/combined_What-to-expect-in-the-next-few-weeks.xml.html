        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin discussed the need for scripts to support a URSF (User Activated Soft Fork) that works with source code he had previously pointed out on his blog. Running a client with a validation requirement of "blocks must (not) signal" can handle the possibility of a chain split, where the preferred ruleset ends up on the less-work side. However, forkd isn't quite enough to do that reliably as it starts disconnecting nodes who forward blocks to you that were built on the block you disconnected. Being able to see the other chain has more work might be valuable to add some sort of user warning signal. If there is a non-trivial chain split, then everyone has to deal with splitting their coins across different chains. It seems hard to do all that stuff in a separate script without updating the node software itself. While forkd is state of the art, it doesn't come close to addressing all the problems that a chain split would create. Without some sort of existential threat, it seems better to take things slowly and hold off on changes until either pretty much everyone who cares is convinced that the change is a good idea or someone has done the rest of the work to smooth over all the disruption that a non-trivial chain split could cause. Michael Folkson, in his email, requested people to pay attention to Bitcoin's consensus rules and make informed decisions on what to run and support. He warned that if all the information is presented at the last minute, it may confuse users. When in doubt, it is generally better to rely on the status quo and tried and trusted, which would be Bitcoin Core. Alternative releases should only be considered if one is informed about exactly what they are running.</p>
