    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on achieving consensus in the Bitcoin community continues, with some suggesting that the current system of "verbal and social wrangling" is the best we have, but wondering if there could be a better way. One suggestion is to establish a minimum and maximum amount of things required for deciding consensus, and to incorporate non-developer stakeholders into the process. The idea of wallet votes has been proposed, but concerns about centralization pressures have been raised. Coin-weighted polling may be a useful alternative, providing a signal about what the consensus is among coin owners who take the poll. There are also discussions on the role of developers, miners, and holders in the decision-making process, with suggestions that a consensus among all of them should be ideally sought after for a smooth upgrade. Meanwhile, on the technical side, there are questions about how nodes decide which blocks are orphaned when only some of them have to signal, and others don't.</p>
