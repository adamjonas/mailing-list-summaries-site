    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Folkson, a Bitcoin Core contributor, has expressed his view that attempts to actively resist the proposed CTV soft fork should be done outside of Bitcoin Core in an alternative client. He argues that getting anything consensus-related into Bitcoin Core is extremely difficult and directing people to have this discussion on a particular PR in the Bitcoin Core repo would be counterproductive and a massive distraction to other work that is going on in Bitcoin Core. Additionally, he mentions that there have been online attacks on Bitcoin Core by CTV proponents claiming an "old guard trying to assert dictatorship over the Bitcoin protocol". Michael advises that discussions on resisting the proposal should take place in the Libera (and Freenode now) IRC channel ##ursf, which has been set up to discuss an alternative client.Currently, there is no PR to actively resist the proposal on bitcoin core, and unless it becomes really messy and poses a true existential threat to Bitcoin itself, he thinks it best that attempts to actively resist the proposal are done outside of Bitcoin Core. Michael tentatively labels this effort a User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF), but he is open to better names. Michael also mentions that currently, they are facing a contentious soft fork activation attempt of CTV using an alternative client, which they expect to be a Speedy Trial deployment. Once this is resolved, they can discuss the lessons and observations that come out of this. There is a blog post [1] and a Twitter thread [2] that provides some additional context for this discussion. It is prudent to prepare for an eventuality where the miner signaling threshold might be reached, but the community wants to prevent the attempted soft fork from activating. A URSF release may ultimately reject blocks that signal for CTV, providing additional direction and incentive to miners that the community does not want this soft fork to be activated.In summary, Michael Folkson suggests that discussions on resisting the proposed CTV soft fork should take place in an alternative client, and he advises against directing people to have this discussion on a particular PR in the Bitcoin Core repo. There is currently no PR to actively resist the proposal on bitcoin core, and Michael tentatively labels this effort a User Resisted Soft Fork (URSF), but he is open to better names. The intention of this URSF release would be to provide additional direction and incentive to miners that the community does not want this soft fork to be activated.</p>
