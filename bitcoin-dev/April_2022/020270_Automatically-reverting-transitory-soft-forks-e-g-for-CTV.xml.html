    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Anthony Towns proposed that the use cases for CTV (Consensus-enforced Transaction Validity) are very long-term in nature and hence incompatible with any sort of sunset that's less than many decades away. He suggests that it might be better to just have it available on a signet. Dave, in response, acknowledged that a temporary test cannot fully replicate a permanent condition but suggested that if people truly believe CTV vaults will significantly enhance their security, it would be worth using them for most of the deployment. Users would receive years of added security and the opportunity to convince other Bitcoiners to make CTV permanent by demonstrating real-world usage.If sunsetting were a good idea, Dave offered a way to implement it through coding. He suggests defining at the outset how we'll signal years later if we want to keep the rules, which he believes is an intelligent approach.</p>
