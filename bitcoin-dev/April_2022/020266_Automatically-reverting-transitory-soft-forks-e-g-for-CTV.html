    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between David A. Harding and Matt Corallo, they discussed the use cases for Bitcoin covenant designs and how they align with Bitcoin's goals. While there is demand for covenant designs, including CTV, there is no clear evidence that it is favored over other designs. They also express concern about determining the best approach and acknowledging that there is no universal best design. The technical community must determine which design is best for real usage data and optimizing demonstrated needs. Additionally, they discuss the risk of doing a fork to begin with and the importance of having a test bed with real paying users. However, Matt Corallo believes that there is demand for some kind of covenant design, regardless of which one is activated.</p>
