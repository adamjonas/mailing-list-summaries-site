    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Robin criticizes Michael's opinions on the activation of CTV and accuses him of stalling protocol development. Robin argues that bike shedding is a way to sabotage protocol development and that Michael's radical opinions could be mistaken for an attack. He also accuses Michael of downplaying the support for CTV and refusing to spend time working on activating covenants while criticizing their activation. Robin believes that Michael's desire to stall development is hard to distinguish from an attack and questions his motives. In response, Michael denies being a full-time CTV developer or advocate and states that the onus is on those proposing the consensus rules to get community review and consensus. Michael has looked into CTV but is not convinced it is the best tool for any of its intended use cases. He also points out that others are working on alternative proposals to CTV and do not support its upcoming activation. Robin suggests that Michael should work on what he thinks is the right path forward instead of criticizing Jeremy's work on CTV.</p>
