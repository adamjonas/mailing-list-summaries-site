    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the discussion revolves around the idea of implementing a new soft fork called BIP 118 as an alternative to BIP 119. The author suggests that BIP 118 could be a more beneficial option since it has been in development for over six years and presents proven and implemented use cases. However, there are several reasons why some people oppose BIP 118, including the fact that it is still in the research phase of implementing covenants in Bitcoin, there is not enough documentation available, no pull request in core for BIP 118 can be reviewed, and there are not enough tools available for testing. Additionally, the author plans to maintain a page for all the NACKs against BIP 118 based on the thread. Luke Dashjr agrees with the author but opposes any soft forks that utilize only speedy trial.</p>
