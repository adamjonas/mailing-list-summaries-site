        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context has been analyzing various covenant proposals from the perspective of wallet vaults. While CTV is considered the minimal covenant opcode that eliminates malleability, other proposed opcodes have interactions that could introduce potentially undesirable effects. TXHASH+CSFS can enable identical capabilities to CTV but its additional features make it more complex, whereas APO wallet vaults are considered hacky, inefficient, and limited. TLUV + IN_OUT_AMOUNT allows infinitely recursive covenants, but it has limitations around multi-input transactions. OP_CHECKOUTPUTVERIFY is an interesting opcode that allows recursive covenants but has similar awkwardness as TLUV + IN_OUT_AMOUNT around multi-input transactions and is also expensive to use beyond simple covenants.Few of these covenant opcodes have been concretely specified and analyzed enough to know whether they're worth pursuing, and all but CTV (potentially TXHASH+CSFS) have significant flaws that would need to be fixed. Overall, none of the other ideas seem to be of high enough quality to be put into Bitcoin in their current state. The author prefers CTV due to its simplicity, blockspace efficiency, and the ability to be used even without taproot. Recently, there have been discussions and explorations on topics related to CTV and other covenant proposals. Some questions were raised regarding whether Bitcoin already has opcodes with overlapping features and whether it is possible to have multiple ways with some overlapping features to do Bitcoin covenants with some tradeoffs - to which the answer was yes. The author also raises a question about the tradeoffs between CTV, APO, TLUV, and TXHASH+CSFS. While the first question was answered by Jeremy and sheshek in the CTV chat, the consensus on the second question is not clear.When comparing the different options, the author prefers CTV due to its simplicity, block space efficiency, and ability to be used even without taproot. It is necessary to cover bare script, as in segwit v0, to expose a pubkey in case of an EC break can lead to a disaster, and vaults imply very long-lived storage. As quantum computing becomes more prevalent, forcing everyone into a quantum-unsafe position is unsustainable. However, other developers may prefer a different way to do Bitcoin covenant for various reasons. For example, Russel O'Connor prefers the general OP_TXHASH design.</p>
