    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The contentious CTV soft fork activation attempt has been delayed and may now start around August 1st, 2022. The drama seems to have been averted for now, but Michael Folkson remains skeptical that this soft fork activation attempt will obtain community consensus in the next three months. Folkson urges everyone to be transparent and take ample time to research and prepare before making decisions on what software to run.Jeremy Rubin explains that the proposal was not a committed plan but rather offered up for discussion to a public working group for feedback as a potential plan. Rubin assures that there already are scripts to support a URSF that work with the source code he pointed out in his blog. The bitcoin developers care about the industry despite differing viewpoints on some issues.Michael Folkson, a member of the Bitcoin community, is warning users about a potential contentious soft fork activation attempt. He encourages users to be informed on the situation and to rely on trusted sources like Bitcoin Core. He fears that information may be withheld until the last minute and confusion may be intentionally created to sway users. If users are interested in resisting the contentious soft fork activation attempt, they can join ##ursf on Libera IRC. Folkson hopes that those behind the attempt will see sense so that the Bitcoin community can move on to more productive endeavors. The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.Personal attacks will not stop a chain split but they might derail the covenants research and development.</p>
