    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There was no mailing list post about a potential plan to support a URSF because it was only offered up for discussion to a public working group for feedback. Jeremy Rubin, who had been hoping to share something with the list soon, has not been able to get coherence on a best next step among those interested in discussing. There are already scripts available to support a URSF that work with the source code pointed out in Rubin's blog, and he believes it is important to keep this in mind. Michael Folkson had previously communicated that Speedy Trial miner signaling for the contentious CTV soft fork is no longer going to start on May 5th as previously communicated, and may instead start around August 1st 2022. He expressed skepticism that this soft fork activation attempt will obtain community consensus and will no longer be contentious even in the next 3 months. Folkson urged the community to come to an informed view independently and not be rushed into making decisions. He also warned against being convoluted and confusing in presenting information, and advised relying on the status quo and tried and trusted approach like Bitcoin Core.Billy Tetrud criticized Folkson's suggestion of blindly trusting authorities from 2015-2017 and implied that it goes against the bitcoin ethos. Folkson had urged users to pay attention so they can make their own informed view on what to run and what to support, and hoped that things will not be made as convoluted as possible in a way intended to confuse. He expressed concern that information will be withheld until the last minute, and recommended alternative releases such as those seeking to attempt to activate CTV or indeed those seeking to resist the activation of CTV only be considered if users are informed on exactly what they are running.</p>
