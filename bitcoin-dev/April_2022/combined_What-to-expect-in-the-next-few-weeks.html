        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson expressed concern about the potential chaos that could arise in the Bitcoin community regarding consensus rules. He emphasized the importance of paying attention and making informed decisions on what software to run and support. Folkson acknowledged that those who were present during the period from 2015 to 2017 would have an idea of what to expect and highlighted the success of the right outcome in 2017. However, he cautioned against blindly trusting authorities, as it contradicts the ethos of Bitcoin and could be detrimental to the community.Folkson also voiced apprehension that crucial information may be withheld until the last moment and that certain parties might exploit a contentious soft fork activation attempt. He warned that these attempts could be deliberately convoluted to confuse participants. To mitigate this risk, Folkson recommended relying on the tried and trusted status quo, particularly Bitcoin Core. He advised individuals to consider alternative releases only if they possess comprehensive knowledge about them.Furthermore, Folkson invited those interested in resisting the contentious soft fork activation attempt of CTV to join ##ursf on Libera IRC. By joining this platform, individuals can collaborate with others who share similar concerns and work towards a resolution. Folkson expressed hope that the parties behind the activation attempt would reconsider their stance, allowing the community to refocus on more productive endeavors instead of resisting contentious soft forks.Overall, Folkson's message serves as a reminder for the Bitcoin community to remain vigilant and well-informed during a potential challenging period. It emphasizes the significance of relying on trusted sources and seeking detailed understanding before making decisions. The invitation to join ##ursf on Libera IRC provides a platform for like-minded individuals to come together and address the issues at hand.</p>
