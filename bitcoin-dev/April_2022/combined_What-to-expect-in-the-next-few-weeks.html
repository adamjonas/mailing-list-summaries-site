        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is currently engaged in discussions about a potential contentious soft fork activation attempt known as CTV and its activation parameters. Various technical arguments and challenges related to adding a seed node set, using scripts to support validation requirements, and handling a chain split have been raised. There are concerns about obtaining community consensus for this attempt, which has been postponed from May 5th to August 1st, 2022.Michael Folkson, a Bitcoin developer, warns users against rushing into running things without understanding their implications and being convoluted and confusing in presenting information. He recommends relying on the status quo and using tried and trusted releases like Bitcoin Core, unless users are well-informed on alternative releases. Folkson is skeptical that this soft fork activation attempt will obtain community consensus in the next three months.Jeremy Rubin explains that there are already scripts available to support a URSF (User-Activated Soft Fork) with the source code provided on his blog. However, there is skepticism about obtaining community consensus over the next three months for this soft fork activation attempt. The challenges of handling a chain split are highlighted, including the risk of ending up isolated and the need to split coins across different chains.
