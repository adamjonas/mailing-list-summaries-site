    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ongoing debate over the activation of the CTV soft fork on Bitcoin Core has been a contentious issue among developers. Michael Folkson, a developer on the platform, has expressed his concern that if Jeremy Rubin's activation attempt causes uncertainty and confusion, it will make future soft forks that do have community consensus orders of magnitude harder to pull off. There are a number of individuals who have stated opposition to attempting to activate a CTV soft fork in the near term. However, Folkson urges developers to keep the assumption of good faith unless they are actually accusing people of being an NSA-adjacent asset.Folkson explains that the latest Bitcoin Core release candidate does not contain any new soft fork code, either CTV code or any new activation code. Running Bitcoin Core 23.0 out of the box will not signal for any new soft fork and will not enforce any new soft fork rules (CTV or otherwise). Most of those individuals who have opposed the activation of the CTV soft fork have not logged their opposition on Jeremy's site, which means their views haven't been included or discussed in Jeremy's latest blog post.According to Folkson, assuming 90 percent of miners don't signal for the CTV soft fork, then the activation attempt will have failed, and it will be back in Jeremy's court whether he tries again with a different activation attempt. Assuming 90 percent of miners do signal for it, then the CTV soft fork could activate unless full nodes resist it. This resistance would most likely be in the form of a UASF style client, which rejects blocks that apply the CTV rules and/or includes transactions that don't meet the CTV rules post-activation.Folkson advises those who oppose this soft fork activation attempt to voice their opposition, run full node software that doesn't include CTV and CTV activation code such as Bitcoin Core and if/when necessary and available run full node software that proactively rejects application of the CTV rules. He states that the primary focus should be resisting soft forks that don't have community consensus and ensuring Bitcoin doesn't splinter into a large number of different assets/blockchains with different combinations of soft forks active.In conclusion, the activation of the CTV soft fork on Bitcoin Core remains a contentious issue among developers. Folkson urges developers to keep the assumption of good faith unless they are actually accusing people of being an NSA-adjacent asset and advises those who oppose this soft fork activation attempt to voice their opposition and take necessary measures to resist it.</p>
