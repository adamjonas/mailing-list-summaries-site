    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to Michael and Jorge, Ryan Grant expressed his belief that it is ethically inappropriate to make personal attacks on the trustworthiness of participants on a list, especially based on vague grounds such as disliking an activation proposal. He provided a link to Wikipedia's "Assume Good Faith" page to support his argument. Ryan then went on to express his frustration with how some people disregard dissent based on the assumption that it comes from "people who just look for dissent." He clarified his bias against Jeremy and stated that he believes it is fair to speak the truth. However, he also feels that it is hypocritical and unethical to have rules that are only expected to be followed by some.Ryan disagreed with the idea that it is against the spirit of the project to base judgments of a technical solution on who presents them. He apologized for not being able to distrust every other developer as much as he can distrust Jeremy. Ryan argued that if someone disagrees with ideas, they should shoot them down on technical merits rather than basing their judgment on who presented them. He cited examples of BIP8 and speedy trial, which he believes were discarded based on who promoted them rather than their technical merits. Ryan felt that there has been a biased against people like Luke-jr or himself. However, he acknowledged that this view could be subjective and that he may be paranoid.Finally, in response to the suggestion that disagreements should be taken to smuttier sections of the internet, Ryan made a playful joke about taking it to Twitter.</p>
