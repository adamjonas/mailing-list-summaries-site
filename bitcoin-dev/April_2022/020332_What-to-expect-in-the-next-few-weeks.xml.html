    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to recent updates, the Speedy Trial miner signaling for the contentious CTV soft fork will not start on May 5th as previously communicated and may instead start around August 1st, 2022. The author is skeptical that the soft fork activation attempt will obtain community consensus in the next three months, and believes a URSF effort will be required down the line. The author emphasizes the importance of transparency and ample time to research and prepare before making decisions on what software to run. The mailing list appears to be bypassed in favor of personal blogs and messaging apps, but the author promises to keep the list informed if necessary. The author also cautions against rushing into running things without understanding their implications and only signaling for a soft fork if there is community consensus. The author encourages interested parties to join ##ursf on Libera IRC if they are interested in the effort to resist the contentious soft fork activation attempt of CTV.</p>
