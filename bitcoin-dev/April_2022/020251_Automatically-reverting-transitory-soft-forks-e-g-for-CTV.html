    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>David Harding has proposed the idea of making CTV an automatically reverting consensus change with an option to renew. This would mean redefining OP_NOP4 as OP_CTV for five years from BIP119's activation date and then reverting to OP_NOP4. However, some concerns have been raised about this proposal, such as usage and maintenance burden. To mitigate these concerns, an expiry height could be encoded in the address and pubkey, and CTV could be honored for UTXOs during the active period. The main issue with CTV is the miner-decision route, either it has community support, or it doesn't. If it does, miners shouldn't have the ability to veto it. If it doesn't, miners shouldn't have the ability to activate it (making it a 51% attack). Luke Dashjr agrees with the idea of an automatically reverting soft fork for CTV but believes that a UASF client compatible with a speedy trial release for BIP 119 could be a better way to activate CTV. Users can decide if they prefer mining pools to make the decision for them or they want to enforce it irrespective of how many mining pools signal for it.However, there are downsides to the proposal, such as creating a big footgun where anyone who uses CTV without adequately preparing for the reversion could easily lose their money. Miners would also be incentivized to censor spends of the reverting opcode near its reversion date. Despite these issues, an automatically reverting soft fork gives us the ability to experiment with new features without committing ourselves to live with them forever.</p>
