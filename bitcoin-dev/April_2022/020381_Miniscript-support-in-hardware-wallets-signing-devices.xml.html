    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this email is discussing the difficulty in determining what should be sent to a mailing list without either bombarding readers with company promotional materials or focusing solely on contentious consensus changes. They provide an example of Miniscript, a project that has been in development for several years and was recently merged into the Bitcoin Core wallet. The author links to a blog post by Salvatore Ingala explaining his work to get Miniscript support in the Ledger hardware wallet, which only requires around 20 lines of code but has additional complexity not covered by the code snippet. Ingala also includes a short video demonstrating the potential user experience on a Ledger Nano. The author notes that the Policy/Miniscript compiler(s) currently do not support Taproot trees of scripts, so the focus is primarily on pre-Taproot Bitcoin scripts. Finally, the author mentions that a Bitcoin Core PR review club on Miniscript will be hosted on May 18th for those interested in learning more.</p>
