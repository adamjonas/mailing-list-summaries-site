    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Michael and Robin, Michael expresses his opposition to the activation of CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) soft fork. He argues that the activation of CTV poses a potential chain split risk if full nodes resist it, and therefore opposes its activation. However, Robin questions Michael's opposition and suggests that he is not being constructive with his arguments as they do not reflect the truth of the situation. Robin believes that CTV is intentionally designed to be a simple and conservative upgrade towards full-featured covenants, which are important for many use cases and interesting areas of research such as vaults and scalability solutions.Robin also believes that Michael's concerns about chain split risk apply to any upgrade and that opposing CTV without trying to find a common way forward to activate covenants increases this risk. Robin urges Michael to invest his time in formulating a better solution, rather than simply opposing CTV due to inaccurate framing or opposition to soft forks in general. Michael counters by suggesting that registering opposition to the CTV soft fork activation attempt on Jeremy Rubin's site and running full node software that rejects application of the CTV rules when necessary are the best options for those who oppose the activation.In a separate email, Jeremy Rubin advocates for the activation of CTV and shares his next steps towards achieving this goal. Rubin believes that CTV is the right course of action to take at this time and provides seven reasons why he believes this to be the case. Overall, the debate centers around whether CTV poses a significant enough risk to warrant opposition, or whether it is a necessary step towards enabling important use cases and research opportunities.</p>
