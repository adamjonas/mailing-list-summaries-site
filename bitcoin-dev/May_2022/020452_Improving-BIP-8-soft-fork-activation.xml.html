    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Bitcoin developer has proposed a solution to recent disagreements surrounding BIP 8 and LOT. The developer has removed LOT from BIP 8 and created a new proposal that calculates the MUST_SIGNAL state based on the threshold reached. They have shared a BIP draft with no code and some changes to BIP 8 on GitHub, along with a state transitions diagram. This proposal removes lockinontimeout flag and allows for a longer period for MUST_SIGNAL state if LOCKED_IN was not reached. The MUST_SIGNAL state is calculated as ((100-t)/10)*2016 blocks, where t is the threshold reached. Blocks that fail to signal in the MUST_SIGNAL phase will be invalid. An example scenario was provided, where this activation method is used for a soft fork, only 60% of miners signaled readiness, and the MUST_SIGNAL phase lasts for 4*2016 blocks. The locked-in and active states remain the same as BIP 8, and the soft fork is activated with a delay of two months. The email was sent using ProtonMail secure email.</p>
