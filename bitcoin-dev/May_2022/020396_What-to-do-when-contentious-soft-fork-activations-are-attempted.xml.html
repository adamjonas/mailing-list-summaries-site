    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alicexbt, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, suggests that natural skepticism from ignorance should not be interpreted as opposition to the proposal and should be given small weight. The community needs time to understand, get their questions answered, and come to terms with it. The right approach is to educate those who aren't educated on the proposal and gather consensus on what people think when they understand enough about it to contribute to that consensus. Alicexbt also provides some tips on what to do when contentious soft forks activations are attempted, such as reading all posts in detail with different opinions, avoiding personal attacks, and looking at the technical details, code etc., and comment on things that could be improved.In a separate email thread, Michael Folkson discusses his thoughts on the recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork. He is unsure if the whole thing worked as designed or whether it was the first time a contentious soft fork activation was attempted, and they were all woefully unprepared for it. He believes that it is totally unacceptable for one individual to bring the entire Bitcoin network to the brink of a chain split and proposes a personal cost to dissuade them from trying it again. However, he acknowledges that Bitcoin is a permissionless network, and no authority can stop things like this from happening again.</p>
