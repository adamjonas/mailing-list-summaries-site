    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Jonas Nick and waxwing/AdamISZ, they discussed the idea of key aggregation failing if duplicate keys are found. Waxwing believes that identifying dishonest signers is not entirely useful, as there are an infinite number of ways an implementation can be broken. However, Jonas argues that aborting in KeyAgg when encountering duplicate public keys is compatible with the MuSig2 BIP draft. They also discussed the consequences of allowing duplicate public keys versus aborting on them. While waxwing thinks that identifying the disruptor is complex, Jonas disagrees. The email exchange also discusses how to handle persistent identities not tied to secp256k1 curve points, and how to handle attackers attempting to disrupt the protocol. In conclusion, while Jonas acknowledges that applications can make progress by identifying at least one attacker, waxwing still believes it's better to abort early in most usage scenarios.</p>
