    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Jorge Timón and John Tromp on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has sparked a discussion on irony. Timón accused Tromp of making personal attacks against Andreas Antonopoulos for his opinions on bip8. However, Tromp pointed out that Timón himself had made a personal attack by calling Jeremy ignorant about bip8. This led to a discussion on how ironic it is that people who base their arguments on personal attacks are also the ones who complain the most about personal attacks. Timón claimed that those against bip119 are simply ignorant about it, just as one could claim that those against bip8 do not really understand it. The conversation then turned to the spreading of misinformation, with both sides accusing the other of doing so. However, as one participant noted, the people claiming to be concerned about misinformation are often the ones who spread the most misinformation themselves. In summary, the email exchange highlighted the irony in the behavior of those involved in the discussion.</p>
