    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email is reflecting on a recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork on Bitcoin and discussing what should be done differently if it happens again in the future. He acknowledges that some users were misled, but notes that well-known Bitcoin educators brought attention to the dangers, and a movement against the activation gained momentum. However, the author was disappointed that an organization called Bitcoin Optech didn't cover his previous posts highlighting the dangers. The author suggests that there must be a personal cost to an individual who brings the entire Bitcoin network to the brink of a chain split. He questions whether the personal cost the community is now prepared to impose on the instigator(s) is sufficient to dissuade them from trying it again. The author believes that Bitcoin is fundamentally broken if an individual can bypass technical concerns from many developers, bypass Bitcoin Core and users, and go directly to miners to get soft forks activated. The author advises readers to avoid considering something contentious just because someone said it on a mailing list, to avoid spreading misinformation, to read all posts in detail with different opinions, to avoid personal attacks, and to look at the technical details and code before commenting on things that could be improved. The email concludes with the author expressing gratitude to those who expressed concerns publicly and actively resisted the contentious soft fork activation attempt.</p>
