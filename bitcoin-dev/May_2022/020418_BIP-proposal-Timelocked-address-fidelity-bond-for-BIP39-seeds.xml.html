    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Chris Belcher and ZmnSCPxj on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the possibility of renting fidelity bonds for generating yield. While this idea may appeal to hodlers who don't wish to go through the hassle of running a full node and yield generator, it comes with the risk of a random income not covering the fixed rent cost. The discussion goes on to highlight the potential market of lessors and the possibility of surveillors creating multiple fake identities to obtain privacy data by paying rent money to the lessor market. However, Chris proposes a solution to this issue by removing the intermediate certificate keypair and having the fidelity bond UTXO key sign the endpoint directly to eliminate the possibility of fidelity bonds in cold storage. This would have to be done for privacy reasons and seems like a feasible solution to the problem. It is interesting to note that JoinMarket/Teleport has about 600 bitcoins locked up and advertised, which must be all on hot wallets due to a lack of cold storage solutions for fidelity bonds yet. The discussion also mentions defiads, where Chris and Tamas concluded that rental would happen inevitably. They prioritized propagating advertisements with larger bonded values * min(bonded_time, 1 year) as a solution for defiads, but caution against using it for privacy-sensitive applications like JoinMarket/Teleport.</p>
