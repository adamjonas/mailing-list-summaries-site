    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chris Belcher, a developer of JoinMarket and Teleport, responded to ZmnSCPxj's inquiry about using the same fidelity bond (FB) in both JoinMarket and Teleport. He stated that it is an intended feature and can be used across different applications without being abusable. However, he acknowledged that it would be problematic if two makers in the same application used the same FB and noted that JoinMarket takers are already coded to check for this, while Teleport takers will soon follow.AdamISZ, also known as waxwing, questioned the use of the same FB in both JoinMarket and Teleport from an economic perspective. He suggested that it would be fine for a closed system, but not an open one, as participants may not have fixed the set of possible usages in advance, leading to an effective Sybilling problem. To address this issue, AdamISZ recommended including domain separation via part of the signed message, which Chris Belcher agreed with.</p>
