    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, has addressed the negative outcomes that have arisen from his post on "7 Theses on a next step for BIP-119". He apologized for any role his actions had in leading to the spread of disinformation and confusion within the Bitcoin community. While he is not advancing a Speedy Trial activation of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-119 (BIP-119) CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) at this time, Rubin believes that it is critical to address concerns and improve Bitcoin's technical consensus process. Rubin identified three main negative outcomes from his post: confusion about Bitcoin's technical consensus process, fear about the safety of covenants, and misunderstandings around activation and release mechanisms. To address these issues, Rubin believes that the Bitcoin technical community should work towards better documenting Bitcoin's technical consensus process, addressing concerns about covenants, renewing conversations about activation and release mechanisms, and systematizing knowledge around covenant technologies. Rubin acknowledges that these conversations may be messy but believes that they represent important opportunities to participate in defining the future of Bitcoin. He welcomes feedback and criticism from the community on how to work towards consensus going forward. Ultimately, Rubin believes that this work is critical to the future of Bitcoin and to making the world a freer place.</p>
