    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about rationality and how it relates to different goals. The author defines rationality as an attempt to use one's available tools to maximize their goals, which can be completely arbitrary. The idea that someone can be "more rational" than someone else is challenged as everyone has different skills and proficiencies. The conversation then shifts towards discussing the objective goals of Bitcoin and how to achieve alignment among Bitcoiners. A futures market for predictions is suggested as a means to better understand people's goals without revealing them directly. However, it is noted that persistent irrationalities embedded in the design of the human mind will still be difficult to break.</p>
