        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Fidelity bonds are being proposed as a way to create trust-minimized federations for chaumian ecash servers or sidechains. This system involves deliberately sacrificing bitcoin value in a way that can be proven to a third party, with the value of a fidelity bond being calculated as a greater-than-linear power of the bitcoin sacrifice. While fidelity bonds don't solve the trust issue entirely, they strongly incentivize different fidelity bond owners to actually be different people, which makes it difficult for a sybil attacker to distribute their bitcoins over many different bonds. ZmnSCPxj, a blockchain developer, has suggested a new scheme in which transaction fees from the sidechain or ecash server are divided among the fidelity bonds in proportion to their value. This scheme is similar to his old idea of "mainstake," where funds are locked up on the mainchain for constructing new sidechain blocks. The share of the sideblocks will be proportional to the value of the mainstake that was locked up. This scheme can also be used for anything that requires a federation, such as statechains which could use a similar scheme for selecting federation members. Users can also be guided by fidelity bonds to select federation members for smart contracts that are unchained. This system has already been deployed in JoinMarket since August 2021, and about 600 btc have been locked up, some for several years. Anyone can create a fidelity bond and advertise it in the market, making it very much in keeping with the cypherpunk ethos. In this scheme, each fidelity bond owner would create a key in the multisig scheme, and transaction fees from the sidechain or ecash server would be divided amongst the fidelity bonds in proportion to their fidelity bond value. While fidelity bonds don't completely eliminate trust issues, they provide a strong incentive for different bond owners to actually be different people, making it more difficult for attackers to control the system.</p>
