    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a proposal for a new activation mechanism for soft forks, Alice suggests removing the lockinontimeout (LOT) flag and instead calculating the MUST_SIGNAL state based on threshold reached. The proposal also includes using tri-state version signaling that can encode both active support as well as active opposition to an active soft fork. Some miners may use signaling to signal support or opposition and refuse to become ready if they do not support the change. Russell agrees with the idea of using orphaning to alert miners to the fact that a fork has already locked in, but such a thing should be done at a low level. However, he suggests there are other design choices available better than a MUST_SIGNAL state that does not risk potentially taking a large fraction of mining hardware offline for a protracted period of time. Billy provides feedback on the proposal, suggesting specifying minimum_activation_height as minimum_activation_blocks and giving a concept ACK.</p>
