    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the removal of OP_CAT from Bitcoin and its association with covenants. The reason for the removal of OP_CAT was due to its behavior leading to 2^N memory usage. Covenants were first expressed as a possibility during discussions around P2SH when the problem of k-of-n multisignature arose. The sender is paying for the security of the receiver, which was considered unfair. Thus, `OP_EVAL` and the P2SH concept was conceived. `OP_EVAL` could be used to create recursive scripts by quining using `OP_CAT`, but people were talking about re-enabling it somehow by restricting the output size of `OP_CAT`. Because of concerns related to recursive covenants, the modern P2SH is now "just a template" with an implicit `OP_EVAL` of the redeemScript but without any `OP_EVAL` being actually enabled.</p>
