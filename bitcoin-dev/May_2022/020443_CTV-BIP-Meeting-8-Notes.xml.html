    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of covenants in creating walled gardens, which require dynamic rather than recursive covenants for practical implementation. While CTV allows for an arbitrarily long string of covenants, it only permits a predefined iteration of transactions, making the coins locked into a predetermined sequence and unable to be used like normal coins. Even with infinite recursion, creating practical walled gardens is challenging because they would be static and unable to accommodate new addresses. To create a wallet garden, it is necessary to dynamically specify destination addresses so that users can send funds to arbitrary public keys while still ensuring that the government can spend the funds. OP_CHECKOUTPUTVERIFY can provide this kind of dynamicness, enabling more secure wallet vaults. The fear of potential attacks based on covenants, such as visacoin, which requires recursive covenants, is unwarranted as OP_CTV cannot be used for such a thing. Recursion is not possible with OP_CTV, and thus it cannot enable visacoin regardless of political views.</p>
