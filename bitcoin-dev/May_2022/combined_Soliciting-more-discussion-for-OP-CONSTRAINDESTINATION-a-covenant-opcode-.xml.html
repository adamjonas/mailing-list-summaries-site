        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author proposes an opcode, OP_CONSTRAINDESTINATION, to be added to the discussion of covenants and alternative covenant proposals. This proposed opcode enables infinitely recursive covenants but does not prevent malleability on its own. It provides more flexibility than OP_CTV in creating wallet vaults, allowing for spends from a wallet vault that can spend arbitrary amounts and send the rest back to a change address. However, compared to OP_CTV, it has some downsides such as increased implementation complexity and complexity of the possibility space. The opcode's primary purpose is to ensure that only certain addresses are sent to, which is simpler than CTV, but counting output values pushes it into more complex territory.To limit fees with this opcode, an additional opcode called OP_LIMITFEECONTRIBUTION is required. The author also suggests using sponsor transactions alongside the opcode to pay fees. Combining OP_CONSTRAINDESTINATION and OP_PUSHOUTPUTSTACK allows the creation of better wallet vaults, but it increases complexity by pushing dynamic state onto transactions, thus increasing the possibility space of covenant chains.The author believes that wallet vaults are crucial for enabling more secure self-custody setups without sacrificing usability. Making it easier for people to securely self-custody their bitcoins is an essential area of development. Even if other covenant opcodes make CTV obsolete, a 4-6 year head start on better self-custody mechanisms could go a long way to saving many people who need bitcoin a lot of pain.</p>
