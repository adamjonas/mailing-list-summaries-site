        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion on the use of recursive covenants in Bitcoin continues, with some arguing that they are necessary for programmable money while others express concerns about their potential harm if misused. The consensus appears to be that as long as users generate their own addresses and understand the covenants they are using, they can benefit from more powerful contracting. However, some people may refuse to send money to non-covenant addresses. In terms of specific opcode proposals, factors such as functionality, efficiency, ease of use, bug prevention, and maintainability should be considered. Some proposals are weak in one or more of these areas, such as CTV and APO being weakest in functionality, CAT/CSFS being weak in ease of use and bug prevention, and OP_TX being weak in maintainability. The discussion also touches on the re-enabling of OP_CAT, which was previously removed due to its potential enabling of covenants. Some propose creating a new OP_CAT2 as a softfork to enable covenants again. There are different covenant proposals, with simplicity being considered the best by some but more difficult to review and test than speedy covenants (OP_CAT2), which has been implemented for longer. Overall, the discussion around covenants in Bitcoin is ongoing, with different opinions and proposals being considered and evaluated based on various factors.</p>
