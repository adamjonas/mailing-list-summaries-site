    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list touched on various topics related to bitcoin development. One user expressed concern about potential attacks based on covenants, citing visacoin as an example. The thread discussed possible attacks that could be enabled by covenants, including adding demurrage fees to coins or mandating visacoin covenants for withdrawals from Canadian or European exchanges. The discussion also touched on the supposed war on "misinformation" and censorship in the west, leading to fears of attacks on bitcoin.The meeting summary covered several topics, including an APO version of the simple vault, APO as an alternative to CTV, fiatjaf's CTV spacechain demo, comparing CTV with other covenant proposals, recursive covenants, and responding to FUD. The APO version of the simple vault was found to be vulnerable to the half-spend problem, but could use APO-as-spec'd with SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY to solve the problem. APO was found to be unusable as a CTV alternative, with main drawbacks being the additional witness satisfaction cost and network-side full-node validation costs. Recursive covenants were discussed, with some users expressing aversion to infinite recursion due to potential risks. Responding to FUD, it was suggested that concerns about recursive covenants be clearly explained and that blacklists be included in the bug bounty offer. In conclusion, the bitcoin-dev mailing list covered various topics related to bitcoin development, including concerns about attacks based on covenants, APO versions of the simple vault, comparisons between CTV and other covenant proposals, and discussions on recursive covenants and responding to FUD.</p>
