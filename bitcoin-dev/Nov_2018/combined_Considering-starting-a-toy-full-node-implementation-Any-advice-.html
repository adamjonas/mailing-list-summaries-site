        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, an individual expressed their intention to develop a toy full-node implementation for educational purposes. They sought advice on which resources to use as a reference for the protocol, where to start, and any general tips or advice for such a project. Artem, in response, advised the individual to start small and take small steps, such as connecting to nodes and downloading blocks. They also suggested that the individual should not dismiss the idea of creating a wallet or mining capabilities, as these can provide a good understanding of keys and transactions. Additionally, Artem warned that the individual should be prepared to work with large and diverse sets of data. They also mentioned that new exploitable signatures are unlikely to be found, as there are constantly bots scanning the blockchain for weak keys and signatures.Artem provided several references for the individual, including bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference, en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation, and github.com/bitcoin/bips. They wished the individual luck and fun in their project. The individual mentioned considering using btcd as a reference since they are unfamiliar with C++. They clarified that they do not intend to include a wallet or mining capabilities in their implementation. It is worth mentioning that one reply in the discussion warned against using an SSD or SD card due to the potential damage caused by repeated downloading of the blockchain, based on previous experiences. Finally, another reply cautioned about the presence of artwork and puzzles in the early blockchain, highlighting its historical significance.</p>
