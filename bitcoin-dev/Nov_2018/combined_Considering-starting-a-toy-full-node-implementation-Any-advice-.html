        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has expressed an interest in developing a toy full validating node implementation for educational purposes. They are seeking advice on which resources to use as a reference for the protocol, where to start, and any other general tips for such endeavors. Replies suggested starting small and building up, while also being prepared to work with large amounts of data and non-standard scripts. One reply warned against using an SSD or SD card due to the repeated downloading of the blockchain, which led to damage during previous attempts.Various resources were recommended for reference, including bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation, and BIPs on Github. Another reply noted that while it may be tempting to try exploiting signatures found on the blockchain, such vulnerabilities have already been exploited and bots are constantly scanning for new ones. Finally, one reply warned of the presence of artwork and puzzles in the early blockchain. Artem advised the individual to start small and aim for small steps, such as connecting to nodes and downloading blocks. They also suggested that the individual not write off making a wallet or mining, as they can provide good understanding of keys and transactions. Furthermore, Artem warned that the individual should expect to work with huge and varied sets of data and that new exploitable signatures are unlikely to be found due to bots constantly scanning the chain for weak keys and signatures. Finally, Artem provided references, such as bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference, en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation, and github.com/bitcoin/bips, and wished the individual luck and fun in their project. The writer is planning to develop a toy full validating node implementation solely for educational purposes. They seek suggestions regarding the reference for the protocol, advice on which part to start with, and any general tips or advice. The writer has considered using btcd as a reference since they are unfamiliar with C++. They do not intend to include a wallet or mining capabilities in their implementation.</p>
