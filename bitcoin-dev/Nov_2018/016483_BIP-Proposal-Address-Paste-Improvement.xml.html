    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the mechanism for end-users to transfer an address from a web page to the wallet address input field. QR code scanning of a Bitcoin URI, bitcoin: URI intent or BIP70 payment message intent can be used for this purpose. However, in many cases, addresses are presented as text, which users have to copy. There are concerns that this may incentivize users to use copypaste functionality extensively. A counter-argument was made that crypto hijackers use the clipboard because it is the most convenient thing to hijack, not because they can only hijack that. If Bitcoin users would move to other ways of specifying destinations, that may end up being just as much of an issue too. The rest of the conversation was about crypto hijackers, which is off-topic in this thread.It is noted that there is already a work-in-progress implementation in Wasabi. For cases where the payee is a well-known entity, the BIP70 payment protocol has authentication via certificates; however, it does not work for the "the person in front of you is the only trust anchor you have" use case. There are also BIP75 and BIP47 that may help; however, the number of wallets that support these protocols is small, likely due to their relative complexity.</p>
