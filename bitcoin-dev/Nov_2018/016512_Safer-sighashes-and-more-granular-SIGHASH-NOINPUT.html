    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Bob McElrath recently shared his experimental wallet that implements Bitcoin Covenants/Vaults using "Pay-to-Timelock Signed Transaction" (P2TST). The concept is to deposit funds to an address for which the private key is unknown and construct a second transaction sending it to a timelocked staging address with a private key, along with an IF/ELSE condition. One must delete the private key of the deposit address or generate a signature directly using a RNG. This construction of covenants/vaults requires NOINPUT, as standard sighash's commit to the txid, which in turn commits to the address, which commits to the pubkey, resulting in a circular dependency on the pubkey. Sipa's proposal, bip-schnorr, is compatible with this vaulted construction by using SIGHASH_NOINPUT | SIGHASH_SCRIPTMASK to remove the scriptPubKey/redeemScript from the sighash, thus removing the circular dependency.McElrath believes that covenants could be made using OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK or OP_PUSHTXDATA. He also expressed excitement to combine the above idea with Taproot/Graftroot/g'Root.</p>
