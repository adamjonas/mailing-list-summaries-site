        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The writer is proposing a change in the language of seed words in BIP-39 to support inter-operability. They suggest a standalone third-party tool that can convert mnemonic sentences from one language to another, which would not make wallets more complicated or increase development costs. The symmetric function in SLIP-0039 is suggested as a good idea to help with migration of existing wallets. The writer believes that changing the language will not further complicate wallets, and multiple language support could provide an additional benefit of doing checksums in different languages.The lack of localized words for recovery phrases causes more money loss than supporting it, according to Jon's comments, which worries the writer. They believe that providing a way for everyone to master their crypto assets is essential, especially for those who cannot handle English. The writer suggests allowing representation of the seed in decimal numbers to be helpful for those without a native language wordlist.The writer emphasizes that supporting multiple languages is crucial, and only using English is not ideal. They suggest that wallets don't have to support all languages, but providing a way for users to switch languages is important. The writer also suggests that the symmetric function in SLIP-0039 can help with migration of existing wallets.</p>
