    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list asked for advice on developing a toy full validating node implementation for educational purposes. Replies suggested starting small and building up, while also being prepared to work with large amounts of data and non-standard scripts. One reply warned against using an SSD or SD card due to the repeated downloading of the blockchain, which led to damage during previous attempts. Various resources were recommended for reference, including bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation, and BIPs on Github. Another reply noted that while it may be tempting to try exploiting signatures found on the blockchain, such vulnerabilities have already been exploited and bots are constantly scanning for new ones. Finally, one reply warned of the presence of artwork and puzzles in the early blockchain.</p>
