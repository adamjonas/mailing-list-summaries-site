    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there was talk of finding a way to sign an additional script that is not committed to by the witness program. One suggestion was to use the annex to contain both the script and signature concatenated. However, it was pointed out that this is not possible since the entire annex is signed. The suggestion could work if the signed "script" doesn't require further input, such as per-input lock-time, relative lock-time, or check block hash. The conversation ended with regards from ZmnSCPxj.</p>
