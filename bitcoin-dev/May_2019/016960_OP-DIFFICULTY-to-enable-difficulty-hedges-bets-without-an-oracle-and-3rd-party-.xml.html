    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer proposes the use of a new opcode, OP_DIFFICULTY, to manage the risk associated with difficulty changes in mining. This opcode would put the value of difficulty for the current block onto the stack and allow the output script to compare it with a strike using a key that can spend it. The input of the transaction would be a multi-sig escrow of those who entered the bet, and the winner would broadcast. This transaction would not have any counterparty risk and would not require an oracle to settle according to the bet. Tamas plans to draft a BIP for this proposal, which he believes would serve a significant economic interest of the Bitcoin economy and is compatible with Bitcoin's aim not to introduce a third party. However, Nathan Cook suggests using OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT as proposed by Luke Dashjr, but Tamas points out that this opcode fetches the block hash and not the content of the header.</p>
