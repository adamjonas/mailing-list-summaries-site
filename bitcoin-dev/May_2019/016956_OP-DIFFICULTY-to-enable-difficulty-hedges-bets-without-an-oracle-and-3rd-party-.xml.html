    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by Tamas Blummer to introduce a new OP_DIFFICULTY opcode that would allow for the creation of a transaction using nLocktime denominated in block height, which would be valid after the difficulty adjusted block in the future. The transaction would use a multi-sig escrow input of those who entered the bet and the winner would broadcast. This would not carry any counterparty risk and would not need an oracle to settle according to the bet. Blummer plans to draft a BIP for this as he thinks this opcode would serve significant economic interest of Bitcoin economy, and is compatible with Bitcoinâ€™s aim not to introduce 3rd party to do so. Nathan Cook had suggested using OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT as proposed by Luke Dashjr instead of the proposed opcode, but it was pointed out that it would not help as it fetches block hash and not the content of the header. Tamas Blummer invites contributions and feedback on his proposal.</p>
