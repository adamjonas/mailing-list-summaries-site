    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, users discussed the standardness of transactions. It was noted that documenting standardness is difficult as it varies from version to version. James provided a reference for default TX_NONSTANDARD policies in v0.18. However, this only applied to v0.18 and may already be outdated. The discussion continued with questions about whether non-usual transactions will propagate normally and how to know what nodes will accept or not. P2PKH and P2WPKH cannot have custom scripts. However, any custom script can be wrapped in P2SH and P2WSH and it will be propagated. The old SHA bounty transactions were propagated before `isStandard`, and today an SHA bounty can still be propagated if it's wrapped in a P2SH or P2WSH. Nodes on Bitcoin Cash were also discussed, but it was deemed off-topic.</p>
