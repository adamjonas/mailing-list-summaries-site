    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread discussing Tapscript, Russell O'Connor proposed changing the specification to require the stack to be empty upon completion rather than containing a single non-false value. This would remove a potential malleability vector and simplify development, as well as allowing for easier implementation of conjunctions and disjunctions of policies. Pieter Wuille commented that the spending cost of Miniscript policies would not change significantly and that the benefits would only be marginal. Additionally, he suggested requiring the last element of the stack to be 0x01 to align with MINIMAL_IF semantics, but noted the downside of needing to add an additional OP_0NOTEQUAL in some cases. Overall, it was decided that the proposed changes were not necessary and would cause more confusion than benefit.</p>
