        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new Bitcoin opcode, OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY, has been proposed by Jeremy Rubin to implement a trustless congestion control technique via a rudimentary, limited form of covenant. The changes would allow Bitcoin users to confirm payments to many users in a single transaction without creating the UTXO on-chain until a later time, improving the throughput of confirmed payments at the expense of latency on spendability and increased average block space utilization. The BIP covers this use case in detail and proposes deploying the change simultaneously with Taproot as an OPSUCCESS. An initial reference implementation of the consensus changes and tests that demonstrate how to use it for basic congestion control is available at <a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/congestion-control">https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/tree/congestion-control</a>. ZmnSCPxj commented that the CoinJoin concept is not much improved by the COHV opcode but cross-input signature aggregation makes it easier to do a coinjoin during a high fee period. ZmnSCPxj thinks lightning is improved by this as it makes it cheaper to create lightning channels during a high fee period. However, he cannot support replacing SIGHASH_NOINPUT with this opcode. He also believes that if the coinjoin group stays around in a Layer 2-ish protocol and coordinates to cut-through transactions, that could provide a scaling and privacy benefit but comes with much harder coordination problems. Two possible improvements to the COHV opcode have been suggested: relaxing the “one input” rule to a “first input” rule and adding more inputs as an alternative to CPFP if the value is insufficient to pay the required outputs; and allowing non-minimal push without requiring minimal push since minimal push is never a consensus rule. Matt Corallo suggests that if covenants are going to be added, they need to have a flexible solution that provides more features than just the OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY opcode.</p>
