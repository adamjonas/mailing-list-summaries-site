        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Blockchain developer Tamas Blummer has proposed a new opcode, called OP_DIFFICULTY, to hedge risks in Bitcoin mining. The proposal involves using nLocktime denominated in block height, and the output script would compare the value of difficulty with a strike which key can spend it. The input of the transaction would be a multi-sig escrow of those who entered into the bet, and the winner would broadcast.However, concerns were raised about the potential for the same transaction to become invalid in some other block mining it and the need to break some existing encapsulations during implementation. Pieter Wuille suggested that if the difficulty can be directly observed by the script language, it would complicate the implementation of mempools and make reasoning about validity of unconfirmed transactions harder. In response, Natanael suggested that the value exposed should be the sum of accumulated proof-of-work (PoW), or in other words, the sum of each block's difficulty value in the entire chain. This would only rise unless there is a reorganization after a difficulty drop caused by blacklisting a valid block several blocks back in the chain. Tamas Blummer agreed with this suggestion, stating that log2work is already computed and would be a strictly increasing value, like time.Blummer's proposal aims to provide a native solution within Bitcoin that does not carry any counterparty risk and does not need an oracle to settle according to the bet. Difficulty changes have a profound impact on miner’s production and introduce the biggest risk while considering an investment. Commodity markets offer futures and options to hedge risks on traditional trading venues, but some might soon list difficulty futures. Nathan Cook had suggested using OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT as proposed by Luke Dashjr instead of the proposed opcode but was pointed out that it would not help as it fetches block hash and not the content of the header. Pieter Wuille responded to Tamas Blummer's suggestion with concerns about the implementation of mempools and the reasoning about the validity of (chains of) unconfirmed transactions if the difficulty can be directly observed by the script language. He believes a similar construction is needed for observing block difficulty, either by having an opcode that posts an assertion or having the assertion be part of the transaction structure.In summary, Tamas Blummer has proposed a new opcode called OP_DIFFICULTY, which could be used to create a transaction using nLocktime denominated in block height. Nathan Cook suggested another way to achieve a similar effect, but it was pointed out that it would not work. Natanael suggests that the value exposed should be the sum of accumulated PoW, and Tamas agrees with this suggestion.</p>
