    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2017, while in college, the author produced a paper on Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) applications and Bitcoin. The paper referenced research done by Gavin Andresen and Rusty Russell. The author admits that they have not looked at this paper or Bitcoin since 2017 and that it was not peer-reviewed; it was only for class. Recently, the author came across the paper while cleaning out old documents and decided to send it to bitcoin-dev in case it could contribute to anything. An HTML attachment was scrubbed, and a non-text attachment of the paper in PDF format was provided.</p>
