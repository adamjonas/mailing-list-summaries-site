        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses a Bitcoin Testing Project. Steve expresses frustration about not being able to do testing as planned and inquires whether donations for the project will be given to the foundation. Peter suggests that the Foundation fund it if crowdfunding is insufficient and proposes moving the current specification into unit tests so that anyone could validate their alternate bitcoin implementation. Steve offers his services in creating a detailed QA process based on the game certification process. Another email author joins the thread, expressing interest in Quality Assurance (QA) discussions but is confused about foundations and their purpose. Gavin responds by discussing the need for proper foundations to ensure long-term usefulness and selecting the right tools for the job. He suggests using 3rd party software and emphasizes the importance of detailed test scripts and plans. In response to concerns expressed by the original email author, Gavin offers to step back and let someone else handle the issue if they feel strongly that he is going about it the wrong way. Two unrelated emails follow the discussion, one advertising AppDynamics Lite, which helps developers determine how slow their code is in production, and the other being a signature from Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab.</p>
