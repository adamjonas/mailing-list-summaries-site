    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In October 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed that the tree be frozen following the release of version 0.7.1 until ultraprune was either added or rejected. Wladimir agreed with this proposal and had already pulled small changes that were already approved for post-0.7.1. However, Wladimir later realized that 0.7.1 was still in rc (release candidate) and not final. He had merged #1901 from laanwj/2012_10_remove_strlcpy, #1900 from Diapolo/optionsmodel_getters, #1913 from sipa/noi2p, and #1879 from sipa/fdatasync, but did not believe any of these changes would cause issues in rc2. If there were problems, a branch would be created for 0.7.x at eb49457 and master would become the 0.8.x branch.</p>
