    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin version 0.7.1 release candidate 1 is now available for download from the sourceforge website. This new version is focused on bug fixes, with some minor changes and features added. The new features include a boolean argument to the RPC 'stop' command, which sets -detachdb to create standalone database .dat files before shutting down. A new command-line option "-salvagewallet" is also added, which moves any existing wallet.dat to wallet.{timestamp}.dat and then attempts to salvage public/private keys and master encryption keys (if the wallet is encrypted) into a new wallet.dat for corrupted wallets. Additionally, the software now automatically imports $DataDir/bootstrap.dat if it exists. On the dependency front, Windows builds now require Qt 4.8.2, and openssl 1.0.1c has been updated for security reasons. In terms of bug fixes, running -testnet uses RPC port 18332 by default, and there are better detection and handling of corrupt wallet.dat and blkindex.dat files. An uninitialized variable bug that could cause transactions to be reported out of order has been fixed, as well as a bug that could cause occasional crashes on exit. Lastly, users are now warned that they need to create fresh wallet backups after encrypting their wallet. Gavin Andresen, one of the core developers behind Bitcoin, shared the details of the update.</p>
