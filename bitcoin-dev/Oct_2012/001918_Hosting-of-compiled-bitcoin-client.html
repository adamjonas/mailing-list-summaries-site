    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on October 14, 2012 at 8:52:33 PM, Kyle Henderson expressed concerns about SourceForge restricting access to certain countries at the request of the USA. He requested clarification on the legality of this situation to ensure that US developers were not made liable for it. The reason for SourceForge's restrictions should be made known so non-US developers and gitian builders can evaluate their own laws and determine if they are in a jurisdiction that allows access. It was also noted that GitHub, which is also located in the US, may present a similar problem for hosting purposes.</p>
