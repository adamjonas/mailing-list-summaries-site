    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concern has been raised about Sourceforge being attacked and a backdoored client being uploaded. While some people don't check signatures, Sourceforge has had some vulnerabilities in the past due to their "your own website on Sourceforge" feature. Github is considered to take security more seriously than Sourceforge. It has been suggested that the best option would be to ask for free hosting from a reputable security conscious bitcoin enthusiast. However, this would create another Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in the coineverse, as Tux is already an SPOF. Moreover, it seems that Sourceforge downloads are blocked in China due to the Great Firewall of China. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to bypass these restrictions.</p>
