        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user named Arklan requested a link and instructions to test a project. Bitcoin Core developer, Pieter Wuille, announced that he had merged his "ultraprune" branch into mainline, which involved significant changes and welcomed any testing. The ultraprune feature uses an ultra-pruned copy of the block chain for validation instead of a transaction index into the block chain, resulting in better performance and a smaller working set size for validation. The changes made include new files, directories, and RPC calls, with LevelDB replacing Berkeley DB for better I/O performance. Wuille believes this is an evolution towards separation between validation nodes and archive nodes, which is needed. Some small changes have been made such as changing the blk000?.dat to blocks/blk000??.dat files of max 128 MiB, pre-allocated per 16 MiB. Instead of a Berkeley DB blkindex.dat, there is now a LevelDB directory blktree/ which only contains a block index, no transaction index. A new LevelDB directory coins/, has also be added which contains data about the current unspent transaction output set. New files blocks/rev000??.dat contain undo data for blocks (necessary for reorganization). Additionally, two new RPC calls are added: gettxout and gettxoutsetinfo.The most noticeable change should be performance: LevelDB deals much better with slow I/O than BDB does, and the working set size for validation is an order of magnitude smaller. Overall, the changes made would prepare for pruning in the future and also facilitate separation between validation nodes and archive nodes. However, this may have profound effects on the network, so discussion may be needed before implementation. No link or instructions were provided for Arklan.</p>
