    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Foundation has disclosed that approximately 3-5% of its initial members double-spent due to a tiny UI issue in web wallets without double-click prevention. In an email conversation, Gavin Andresen agreed to the need for a payment protocol to address issues such as securing bitcoin addresses against man-in-the-middle attacks and providing receipts after sending payment. He also suggested including information on where to send refunds with payments so that overpayments/refunds can be handled efficiently and displayed intelligently in the customer's wallet. Andresen further proposed a protocol for gathering signatures from multiple devices, which could enhance financial controls for companies that operate without bank accounts by allowing bookkeepers to input payments while owners approve them. However, he emphasized the importance of solving critical problems first before addressing other issues.</p>
