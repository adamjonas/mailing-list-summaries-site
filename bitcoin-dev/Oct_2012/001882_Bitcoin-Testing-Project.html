    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Vessenes has sent a detailed and professional response to Steve's question. Steve thanks Peter for his response and also clarifies that he had some confusion in his mind which now has been cleared by Peter's response. Peter accidentally did not reply-all to Steve, but he is cc-ing the detailed response on the list since people are wondering about how the Foundation fits in. The email includes a PGP signature and version information.</p>
