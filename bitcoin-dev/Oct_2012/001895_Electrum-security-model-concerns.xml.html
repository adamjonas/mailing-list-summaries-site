    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security model of Electrum is a growing concern due to the lack of detailed information about it on the website. The website only has vague statements such as "Your private keys are not shared with the server" and "A compromised server cannot compromise your client." However, these claims are factually incorrect, and users need a better understanding of the security of the software they're running. A proper discussion, similar to "Understanding the bitcoinj security model," is needed to avoid misunderstandings that result in users taking riskier behaviors. While the bitcoinj security model gives a reasonable overview, it also makes some false claims regarding detecting double spends. Therefore, a more thorough examination of Electrum's security model is necessary.</p>
