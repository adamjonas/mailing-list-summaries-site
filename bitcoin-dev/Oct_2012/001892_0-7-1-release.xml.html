    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 3, 2012, Gavin Andresen suggested the addition of '-reindex' to perform in-place reindexing of blockchain data files. He also agreed that it needed testing. In another suggestion, he agreed to not request blocks from peers with fewer blocks than them. Another proposal was made to add the new RPC "lockunspent" to prevent spending of selected outputs. Jeff Garzik agreed to this proposal but raised concerns about how lockunspent would miss raw transactions that spend outputs not in the wallet since it is wallet-based like listunspent. Nonetheless, he thinks it's okay because listunspent is already wallet-based and it should be noted.</p>
