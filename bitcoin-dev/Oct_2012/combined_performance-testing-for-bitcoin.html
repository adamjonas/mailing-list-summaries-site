        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context is a discussion between Ian Miers and Jeff Garzik about how to obtain performance numbers for modifications to Bitcoin. Ian Miers was looking for ways to speed up the process of measuring performance as profiling it while running on testnet would take a long time. Jeff Garzik suggested being specific about what aspects of performance are being measured since "performance" is vague. He also recommended measuring blockchain performance by importing blocks via -loadblock=FILE but noted that other performance measurements such as how fast a block can relay through the network cannot be easily measured.Joel Joonatan Kaartinen chimed in with his opinion that benchmarking only good approximations of real-world traffic is not enough, and that worst-case scenarios should be benchmarked to avoid creating a DoS vulnerability. Finally, there was a call to action to deploy New Relic APM for application performance management.Additionally, an email exchange between Ian Miers and Jeff Garzik on October 3, 2012, revealed that Ian was primarily concerned with script evaluation performance and was experimenting with adding new instruction types. To achieve accuracy, he wanted his simulated traffic to approximate real-world traffic. Jeff responded that many aspects of blockchain performance can be measured by importing blocks via -loadblock=FILE, but other performance measurements, such as how fast a block relays through the network, cannot be easily measured. Ian also asked if there was any benchmarking or instrumentation in bitcoind, but the email exchange ended without further information on this topic.There is also a question on the best way to obtain performance numbers for modifications to bitcoin. While profiling it while running on testnet might work, it would take a long time to get data. The query is whether there is any way to speed this up if we only needed to provide relative performance between tests, in a sense a fast performance regression test. One possibility suggested is to replay real bitcoin transactions to a test-net-in-a-box network that has the actual blockchain history loaded into it but then operates at a far reduced hash difficulty to facilitate running quickly. However, the writer is interested in knowing if there are existing techniques/scripts for some kind of perf testing with traffic that approximates real-world traffic since the test infrastructure that ships with bitcoin does not appear to provide this. It is unclear whether the writer intends to use any of these methods or wants to know about them in general.</p>
