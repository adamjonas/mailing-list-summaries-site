    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a need for a payment protocol to solve some of the current problems faced by Bitcoin users. The critical issues that need to be addressed include the insecurity of Bitcoin addresses against man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be solved by implementing a payment protocol that ensures the authenticity of donation links. Additionally, after sending a payment, a receipt should be issued to prove that instructions were followed. A protocol for gathering signatures from multiple devices should also be implemented. Another feature that could be included is where-to-send-refund information with payments to handle overpayments and refunds efficiently. However, other features can wait until later versions of the protocol.</p>
