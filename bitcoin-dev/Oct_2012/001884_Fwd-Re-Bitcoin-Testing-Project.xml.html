    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread revolves around a Bitcoin Testing Project. Steve, who signed up to work on the project and organize it, expresses frustration about not being able to do testing as planned. He inquires whether donations for the project will be given to the foundation and whether the foundation supports it. Peter responds positively to the idea of a testing project and suggests that the Foundation fund it if crowdfunding is insufficient. He also proposes moving the current specification into unit tests so that anyone could validate their alternate bitcoin implementation. Steve offers his services in creating a detailed QA process based on the game certification process.However, the conversation ends with Steve feeling frustrated and useless about his work so far. Another email author joins the thread, expressing interest in being involved in discussions related to Quality Assurance (QA). They are confused about foundations and their purpose and ask whether joining the foundation is necessary for involvement in QA discussions.Gavin responds by discussing the need for proper foundations to ensure long-term usefulness and selecting the right tools for the job. He suggests using 3rd party software and emphasizes the importance of detailed test scripts and plans. Gavin believes that having specific test cases can show which tests have not been run. In response to concerns expressed by the original email author, Gavin offers to step back and let someone else handle the issue if they feel strongly that he is going about it the wrong way. Two unrelated emails follow the discussion, one advertising AppDynamics Lite, which helps developers determine how slow their code is in production, and the other being a signature from Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab.</p>
