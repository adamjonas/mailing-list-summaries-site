        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author is sharing their experience of redownloading blockchain information using the latest git version (tagged v0.7.1rc1) on a fast connection with an SSD disk. However, they are facing issues with duplicate blocks being processed, which is slowing down the process and not increasing the chain height anymore. The author wonders if this is expected and if there is a way to limit unnecessary block downloads.The text then showcases a series of SetBestChain messages, indicating new best chains at different heights and dates. While the author received some accepted blocks, they also encountered several errors where they already had the block or fetched inputs that were not found in the mempool.In the end, the author added addresses from two different IP addresses and received more blocks, including one that was already in their possession. Overall, the author's experience with redownloading the blockchain information using the latest git version has been mixed, with some successes and some challenges.</p>
