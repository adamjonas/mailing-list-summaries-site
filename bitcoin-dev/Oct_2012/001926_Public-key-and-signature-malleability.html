    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille suggested implementing rules to prevent malleability in Bitcoin transactions. If people want these rules, they would first need to find software that doesn't produce non-complying data. Then, the rules could be enabled as a check similar to IsStandard(), making it hard for non-complying transactions to get into blocks, but still allowing them to be accepted when they aren't standard. Finally, when no significant amount of non-standard transactions are seen anymore, a BIP can be written and enforcement of the rules can begin as a network rule.The idea was strongly supported because malleability has caused unexpected outcomes and there may be additional security or denial-of-service problems that arise from allowing it.</p>
