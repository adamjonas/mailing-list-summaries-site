    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message has written a draft BIP that describes the bloom filtering protocol extension they have developed with Matt. They have shared a link to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0037 and asked for feedback on any missing details or inaccuracies. While writing the BIP, the author realized that delaying the reception of invs is somewhat ad-hoc. They suggest it may be better to send a bloom filter in the version message itself. However, having a flag to delay invs allows for the filter to be calculated in parallel to bringing up network connections. Although creating a Bloom filter is fast, deterministic wallets may require many calculations to find the keys to scan for. The author acknowledges that there is a process for getting allocated a number for the BIP, but feels that it is overkill for this particular proposal.</p>
