        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In October 2012, Gavin Andresen proposed the addition of '-reindex' to perform in-place reindexing of blockchain data files. He suggested that it needed testing. Another proposal was made to add the new RPC "lockunspent" to prevent spending of selected outputs. Jeff Garzik agreed to this proposal but raised concerns about how lockunspent would miss raw transactions that spend outputs not in the wallet since it is wallet-based like listunspent. The Bitcoin community decided on a 0.7.1 release to fix the Windows bug related to "click on a bitcoin: URI and nothing happens." It was also proposed to fix the "I upgraded from a binary running an incompatible version of BDB and now I get a DB_RUNRECOVERY error on startup" problem. A pull request was made to fix half of the above-mentioned problem along with several other cases of broken wallets. Another proposed solution involved deleting the bad blkindex.dat file and re-creating it from the blk000?.dat files. Gavin Andresen had an email conversation with Wladimir on October 3, 2012. They decided to do a 0.7.1 release to fix the "click on a bitcoin: URI and nothing happens" bug on Windows. They agreed to add a pull request for in-place reindexing of blockchain data files and another one for adding LOCK() for proxy-related data structures to avoid random crashes due to missing synchronization primitives. These were considered as very-high-priority pull requests that should go into the 0.7.1 release while the rest could wait. Overall, the Bitcoin community discussed multiple proposals and solutions to fix bugs and improve the system's functionality. The focus was on high-priority pull requests, including fixing the Windows bug and addressing issues related to blockchain data files and broken wallets.</p>
