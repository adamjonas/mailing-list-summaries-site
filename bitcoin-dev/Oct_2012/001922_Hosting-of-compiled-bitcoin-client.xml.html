    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate around cryptography has been ongoing for several years. However, according to a recent statement made by a user on social media platform Reddit, the issue is not cryptography itself but rather the trade with sanctioned countries. The poster argues that merely making files available to download can be considered trade and may lead to restrictions on certain downloads. This issue is not new as back in 2005, when the user lived in Sudan, Sourceforge would block certain downloads but not the project site. Despite the restrictions, it was easy to bypass them at the time. The argument presented by the user highlights the complexity of the issue of cryptography and trade restrictions. While many argue for strong encryption protocols to protect privacy and sensitive data, others are concerned about the potential misuse of such technologies by individuals or groups operating outside the law. Additionally, there are concerns about the impact of trade restrictions on innovation and open access to information. Overall, the issue of cryptography and trade with sanctioned countries remains a contentious topic. As technology continues to advance and global tensions rise, it is likely that this debate will continue to evolve and impact the development and distribution of encryption technologies.</p>
