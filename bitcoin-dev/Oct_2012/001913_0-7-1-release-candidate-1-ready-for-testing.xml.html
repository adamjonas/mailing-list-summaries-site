    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Bitcoin community has asked for a Bitcoin-test mailing list to be created for discussion around testing, tools, ideas, and chatter. The request comes after the release of Bitcoin version 0.7.1's first candidate, which includes minor bug fixes, new features, and dependency changes. The most significant new feature is the addition of a boolean argument to the RPC 'stop' command that sets -detachdb to create standalone database .dat files before shutting down. Additionally, the release includes the -salvagewallet command-line option, which moves any existing wallet.dat to wallet.{timestamp}.dat and then attempts to salvage public/private keys and master encryption keys into a new wallet.dat. There were also changes in dependencies, including Qt 4.8.2 for Windows builds and openssl 1.0.1c. Better detection and handling of corrupt wallet.dat and blkindex.dat files was fixed, along with occasional crashes on exit, an uninitialized variable bug that could cause transactions to be reported out of order, and warnings about creating fresh wallet backups after wallet encryption.</p>
