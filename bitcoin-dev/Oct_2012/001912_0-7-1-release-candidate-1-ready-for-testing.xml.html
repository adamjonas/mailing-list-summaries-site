    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen inquires about the progress on a release candidate QA sanity testing plan to which the respondent replies that they have come around to his way of thinking. They discuss testing and the process involved. It is revealed that everything that needs to be covered for a newbe or someone upgrading clients has been covered and is available in many formats at the moment. They have tried to separate the tests into what can be automated, recorded and checked by watching the video with sanity checks along the way. The GAT tests in bettermeans are protocol-based and should be run against all releases. They talk about getting a technet license with the donations so far. The respondent suggests creating a bitcoin-test mailing list for discussion of testing, tools, ideas, chatter, etc. without reporting bugs as the dev list seems focused. They have provided a link to the Bitcoin version 0.7.1 release candidate 1, which is a bug-fix minor release. The email also highlights some new features, dependency changes, and bug fixes included in this release.</p>
