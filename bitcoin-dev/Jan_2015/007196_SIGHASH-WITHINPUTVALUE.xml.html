    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion dated January 23, 2015, Gregory Maxwell and Alan Reiner talked about the possibility of implementing a soft-fork variation that would require coins to enter a wallet with a modified TxOut script in order to achieve a specific benefit. However, this approach was deemed unreasonable by Maxwell, who proposed a straightforward soft-fork approach that is safe, but would only work for people who want the new capability. This approach would require newly created addresses to get coins using the new signature type, which is preferable to expecting everyone else to replace their software with an incompatible new version just to accommodate transactions they may not care about or need to change urgently. Maxwell added that anything requiring coins to originate in a wallet with some special form is a non-starter, and the new SIGHASH type allows transactions to be signed with any coins already in a wallet, imposing no requirements on anyone paying a cold wallet.</p>
