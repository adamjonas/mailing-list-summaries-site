    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen on January 19, 2015, the two discussed the use of protocol buffers in BIP 70. Mike Hearn explained that he chose to use protocol buffers because he designed and implemented the original prototype and was familiar with them from his time working at Google. He also mentioned that JSON was a runner-up for encoding. However, XML+ASN.1 was ruled out due to their complexity, which is considered an enemy of security. Both XML and ASN.1 are disliked by many in the Bitcoin community. Gavin Andresen signed off as the Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation.</p>
