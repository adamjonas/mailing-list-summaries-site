    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the potential risks of an isolated signing device without memory. One such risk is the possibility of someone isolating the node and getting the user to sign away their whole wallet to fees, which can then be sold to a mining pool for mining before the user realizes what has happened. However, it is suggested that nodes not relaying excessive fee transactions could reduce financial risk. The signature request must carry information to validate the value to avoid signing away a large percentage as fees. It is simple and elegant, but there is no live beta mechanism to test this approach, and upgrading the full network would be an issue if it is not backwards compatible.</p>
