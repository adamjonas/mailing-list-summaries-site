    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer, a blockchain developer, highlighted the difference between ownership and ability to deal with an asset in German law. He explained that knowing the private key and owning linked coins is not necessarily the same in front of a court. In other words, being able to deal with an asset does not automatically make one the owner. This contradicts what many people believe about Bitcoin. The idea that Bitcoins have an owner independent from the parties with access to the private keys controlling their disposition, is difficult to reconcile from a technological perspective. Therefore, what newbies in the /r/bitcoin community are being told may be incorrect.</p>
