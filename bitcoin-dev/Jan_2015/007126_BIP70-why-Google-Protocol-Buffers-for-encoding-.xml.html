    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the choice of Google Protocol Buffers for payment request encoding in BIP-0070. Richard Brady argues that performance is not relevant since payment requests are not broadcast, and it would be challenging to attach binary format data to a non-binary format like HTTP. He suggests that human-readable formats like HTTP/JSON/XML are easier to read, write, and contain examples, making it easier to test and debug. Brady also mentions that these formats are specified by independent standards bodies such as the IETF. Jeff Garzik counters this argument by stating that text formats such as XML or JSON are far less deterministic, are more loosely specified, have wide variance in parsing, and are not very hashable. The line between security considerations and performance considerations is blurred for some members of the discussion group.</p>
