    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 4, 2015, Ross Nicoll wrote to a group of individuals about his work on atomic cross-chain trading between Bitcoin and Dogecoin blockchains. He had developed a mostly functional prototype but encountered an issue where the refund transaction being relayed before the actual spend transaction would block the legitimate spend transaction from being accepted into the memory pool. Nicoll had drafted a patch to address this issue but was looking for feedback while he continued testing it. The patch has not been raised yet due to concerns about the amount of discussion that may occur on GitHub.One member of the group responded to Nicoll's message stating that unless there was a serious bug he was not aware of, the unlocked transaction would not be mempooled until right before it locks and therefore would not be relayed. Another member expressed concern that the patch did not have any protection against denial of service attacks, as a single user could potentially update their transaction rapidly and exhaust the relay bandwidth of the entire network.</p>
