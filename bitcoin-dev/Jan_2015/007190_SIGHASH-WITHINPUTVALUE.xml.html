    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a major attack vector in which an attacker isolates a node and gets the owner to sign away their whole wallet to fee, which is then sold to a mining pool to mine before the owner can figure out why their transactions aren't making it to the network. In this scenario, relay rules are not relevant, and if the attacker can conduct a DoS attack for 24 hours, it doesn't take much mining power to make the attack highly likely to succeed. Tamas Blummer suggests reducing financial risk by having nodes not relay excessive fee transactions. The most likely scenario in such an attack is that malware sends the transaction directly to the attacker's pool/miner without pushing it with excessive fees to the network.</p>
