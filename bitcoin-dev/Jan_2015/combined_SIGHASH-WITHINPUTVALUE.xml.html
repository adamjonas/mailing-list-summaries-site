        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a series of emails dated January 23, 2015, on the Bitcoin development mailing list, several developers discussed the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork. Alan Reiner discussed that there was no soft-fork way to achieve the benefit of SegWit that had favorable properties. Most of the soft-fork variations required the coins being spent to have originated in a special way. Slush suggested a straightforward soft-fork approach, which was safe but required people who wanted new capabilities to use newly created addresses to get coins that used the new signature type. Slush also discussed how TREZOR is streaming and validating complex transactions and how they need to stream all previous transactions into the device for every signed input to sign a transaction with hundreds of inputs on a device with limited memory capabilities.</p>
