    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the concerns about the jurisdiction of wallet providers and the challenges faced in doing business. The writer urges people to move away from web wallet businesses due to constant demands for information by governments. They argue that this is no longer viable, citing the extra financial surveillance provisions passed on third party matters post-cromnibus. Instead, the author recommends moving towards peer-to-peer solutions like Core, Electrum Wallet, Mycelium, Local Trader, and Open Bazaar which avoid centralizations and do not collect user data or require identification. They also suggest auto-notifications for updates rather than auto-updating itself. Another participant in the email thread argues that being outside the jurisdiction of wallet providers makes it harder for users to reclaim funds taken by them and easier for the legal hurdles to force confiscation through a wallet provider if the target user is not domestic.</p>
