    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Richard Brady questioned the use of Google Protocol Buffers for payment request encoding in BIP-0070. He argued that text formats such as HTTP/JSON/XML are more desirable due to their human readability on-the-wire, ease of parsing and manipulation, and thorough specification by independent standards bodies such as the IETF. He also noted that payment requests are not broadcast but rather follow a request/response flow similar to a web request. Despite his concerns, he expressed excitement for the growth of the payment protocol regardless of the encoding choice. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist, was copied on the email.</p>
