    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The engineers at Google are familiar with the existence of ASN.1, as stated by one of them. The protobuf FAQ and an email thread provide more information on the topic. ASN.1 should not be used for modern formats due to simplicity and quality of open source implementations, according to those who have worked with both ASN.1 and protocol buffers. Performance is not a concern and HTTP transmits files as binary on the wire. Protocol buffers also have good language support. BIP-0070 does not contain code, but rather a description of what fields a message can contain and their types. JSON is considered unsuitable for applications where correctness matters and binary structures are involved.</p>
