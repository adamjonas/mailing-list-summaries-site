    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A conversation between two individuals, Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd, was held on January 4th, 2015. Maxwell requested the raw transaction from Todd, but figured out the issue himself which involved a problem with the behaviour on testnet. He stated that non-mempooling is enforced by IsStandardTx which is bypassed in testnet and should be enforced elsewhere. Maxwell mentioned that this issue doesn't occur on the real network. There is a pull-req open to fix this issue which can be found on GitHub. Lastly, Peter Todd provided his contact information and a digital signature.</p>
