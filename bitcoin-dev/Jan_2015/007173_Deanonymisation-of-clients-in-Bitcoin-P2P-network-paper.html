    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of Tor to improve Bitcoin wallet security. Distributors of consumer wallets can use research to distribute wallets with policies that are less prone to attacks, especially for mainstream users. A common core can be used for different types of wallets, both mainstream and those designed for crypto geeks. One possible direction is to use Tor for writing to the network and use general link encryption and better Bloom filtering for reading it. Startup speed is an issue for reading from the network and syncing the block chain via clearnet and connecting to Tor in parallel can help alleviate this issue. BIP70 is another interesting option which moves the issue from the payer to the payee, but it may or may not partially relieve network-related issues depending on the usage scenario.</p>
