    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ross has developed a functional prototype for atomic cross-chain trading between the Bitcoin and Dogecoin blockchains, but there's an issue where if the refund transaction is relayed before the actual spend transaction, it blocks the legitimate spend transaction from being accepted into the memory pool. He wants to enable TX replacement in such cases when all conflicting transactions are not final, and the replacement is final. Ross has drafted a patch for this and is looking for feedback while he continues testing that patch. For more background on this topic, refer toÂ <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2516">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2516</a>. Ross hasn't raised a PR yet, as he believes it leads to a lot of discussion on Github which is better suited for a mailing list.</p>
