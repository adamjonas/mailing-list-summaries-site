    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of HTTPS and x509 certificates makes implementation safer and easier for developers as they delegate certificate verification to the platform they are running on. However, if the developer is responsible for checking certificate validity, a different codebase needs to be developed for each platform being targeted, leading to multiple chain verifications and certificate parsing. This can be time-consuming, so many developers end up delegating parsing and trust verification to a third-party service. X509 is an international standard used in common practice, making it a highly portable choice. While protocol buffers may not be the best possible serialization method, one had to be picked, and just like JSON, there are bindings for many languages. However, JSON parsers are much more diverse, which has caused problems for people using Bitcoin Core's RPC, such as difficulty handling large numbers. There is no obvious best choice for serialization method.</p>
