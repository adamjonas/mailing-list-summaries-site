    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between members of the Bitcoin Development mailing list in January 2015, Eric Lombrozo recommended against using Base58 for anything other than copy and pasting by the end user. He stated that internally, public keys are DER-encoded integers. In response to this, Jeffrey Paul sought clarification on the recommendation, asking if it applied to the raw bytes of the public key itself, and not the ASCII Base58 representation of the public key hash. CryptoCorp recommended that their customers sort lexicographically by the public key bytes of the leaf public keys, which was the same as BitPay's convention. Andy Alness of Coinbase also contributed to the thread, indicating that they were using the BitPay convention for their multisig support. Eric Lombrozo further stated that Ciphrex was using this convention well before BitPay, and BitPay's BIP32 implementation was at least partly taken from theirs.</p>
