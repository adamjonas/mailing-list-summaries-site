    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is asking whether there has been any progress or discussion on the issue of hardware wallets becoming more widespread. They provide a link to a BitcoinTalk forum post and note that they do not insist on a specific solution but rather emphasize the importance of finding one. They mention sitting next to a TREZOR device for 40 minutes while it streams and validates a complex transaction, stating that a proposed solution would reduce the signature time to a matter of seconds. The writer argues that finding a solution would not only optimize time, resources, and hardware costs but also simplify firmware and increase security. They ask the community to work towards finding a widely agreed upon solution to this real-world problem.</p>
