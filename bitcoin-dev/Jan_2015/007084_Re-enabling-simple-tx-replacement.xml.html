    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and an unidentified recipient on January 4, 2015, Maxwell requested the raw transaction data for a website, which was not available through the site's API. He later discovered that the problem he was encountering was specific to the testnet, where non-mempooling is enforced by IsStandardTx, which is bypassed in testnet. Maxwell expressed relief that this behavior was not present on the real network. The recipient thanked Maxwell and stated that they would try a patch for testnet the following day.</p>
