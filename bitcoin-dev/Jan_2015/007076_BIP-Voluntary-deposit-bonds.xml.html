    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sergio Lerner, a Bitcoin developer, has proposed allowing miners to add real inputs to the coinbase transaction, which would allow them to voluntarily lock funds. Currently, only pseudo-inputs can be added to the coinbase transaction. This modification to the code is minimal and involves mostly removing code. Lerner believes that this change will help secure the blockchain in the future when the subsidy is lowered, as increasing the number of confirmation blocks could make Bitcoin less competitive with other payment networks. However, some people, including Peter Todd, another Bitcoin developer, have concerns about this proposal. Todd believes that it changes the incentives and makes it easy and secure for individuals to pay miners to mine specific blocks rather than transactions. He also expressed doubts about his own PowPay micropayments scheme, which works better with large mining pools and could incentivize pools to get bigger. Regarding the hard-fork vs. soft-fork debate, Gregory Maxwell's comments were cited as being in line with Todd's opinion.</p>
