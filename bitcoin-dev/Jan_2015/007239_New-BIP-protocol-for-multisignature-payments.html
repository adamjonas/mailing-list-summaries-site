    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is considering implementing a protocol in the future, but would like to receive feedback from the community first. They believe that pairing a protocol specification with an implementation is beneficial as it can identify design issues that were not previously considered. Additionally, implementing a protocol is much more work than simply outlining the protocol's procedures and specifications, so users are unlikely to implement the protocol unless they have confidence in its design and a compelling reason to use it, such as interop with other users.</p>
