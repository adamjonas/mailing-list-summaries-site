    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn discussed the use of protocol buffers in BIP 70 instead of other encoding options such as JSON, XML+ASN.1, or S-expressions. Hearn stated that he chose protocol buffers because of their nice properties and his familiarity with them from his time at Google. Andresen added that XML+ASN.1 was not an option due to the complexity of both formats, which can be seen as enemies of security. The discussion also briefly touched upon the fact that if SPKI had won out, S-expressions would have been used instead of X.509 certificates.</p>
