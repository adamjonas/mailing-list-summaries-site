    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Nicolas DORIER and Wladimir on January 28, 2015, they discussed the use of protocol buffer and x509 by BIP70. While DORIER agreed that the use of these protocols was poor, Wladimir defended their use by stating that x509 is an international standard widely used for portability. He also pointed out that HTTPS makes little sense as TLS internally uses x509 as well. When it comes to serialization methods, Wladimir admitted that one had to be picked and while he wasn't sure if protocol buffers were the best possible choice, it was necessary to make a decision. Similarly, JSON parsers are much more diverse, which has caused problems for users of Bitcoin Core's RPC who have difficulty handling large numbers. Ultimately, there is no obvious best choice for serialization methods.</p>
