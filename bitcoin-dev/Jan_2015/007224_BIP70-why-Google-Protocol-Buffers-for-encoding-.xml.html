    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown person discusses the limitations of BIP70, a payment protocol standard used in Bitcoin transactions. The unknown person argues that while BIP70 has its uses, it is not a good client-side technology due to the burden of certificate verification on developers. They suggest that a standard using JSON and HTTPS would be easier for today's use cases. Mike Hearn counters by stating that platforms supporting HTTPS but not certificate handling are rare, and the embedding of certificates in BIP70 is necessary to make signed payment requests verifiable by third parties. This creates a form of digital receipt that can be automatically verified as legitimate. Additionally, BIP70 requests can be signed by things other than HTTPS servers, allowing for more identification options.The conversation also touches on the difficulty of implementing BIP70 on certain platforms, such as Windows RT and iOS, and the pros and cons of bundling a custom root store versus leveraging the platform for automatic updates. Java can do OCSP checks, but a better solution would be to implement an OCSP stapling extension to BIP70.</p>
