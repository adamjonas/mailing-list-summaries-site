    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Ruben de Vries, CTO of BlockTrail, suggested that a standard way of sorting public keys would make it easier for services that implement some form of multisig to be compatible with each other without much hassle. Ryan from BitPay had previously brought up this issue and in bitcore they have implemented lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key. However, de Vries was unable to find any other library that has a sorting function, let alone using it by default. Miron / devrandom from CryptoCorp recommended that their customers sort lexicographically by the public key bytes of the leaf public keys, which is the same as BitPay. The discussion concluded with Eric stating that everyone is pretty much following this standard now.</p>
