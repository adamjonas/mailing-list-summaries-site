    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>One potential attack on a Bitcoin node is someone isolating the node and getting the owner to sign away their entire wallet to a fee, which the attacker then sells to a mining pool to mine before the owner realizes their transactions aren't making it to the network. In this type of attack, relay rules are not relevant and if the attacker can DoS (Denial of Service) the node for 24 hours, it doesn't take much mining power to make the attack highly likely to succeed.Tamas Blummer suggested a potential solution to reduce financial risk in such attacks: not relaying excessive fee transactions. However, this is not a complete fix to the problem.</p>
