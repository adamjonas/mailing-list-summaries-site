    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the difference between ownership and the ability to deal with an asset. Tamas Blummer points out that knowing the private key and owning the linked coins is not necessarily the same in front of a court as, at least in German law, there is a distinction between ‘Eigentum’ (ownership) and ‘Besitz’ (ability to deal with it). This means that being able to deal with an asset does not make one the owner. Matt Whitlock questions the common belief that Bitcoins have an owner independent from the parties who have access to the private keys that control their disposition; this notion is difficult to reconcile from a technological perspective. The conversation suggests that, although technology can be a strong argument before a court, it may not always fully align with legal definitions.</p>
