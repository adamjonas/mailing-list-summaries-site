        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin has been facing security issues with regards to taking transactions backwards, and a potential threat to the cryptocurrency space is that if Bitcoin addresses were stolen instead of credit-card details, it could lead to the collapse of an organization. An optional identity layer modeled after the Internet itself could be the solution to this problem, requiring collaboration and time to create. The BCI (Bitcoin Identity) layer would provide a killer app and could be a solution for the industry. TNABC (The North American Bitcoin Conference) could provide a platform for collaboration on the issue. However, it is unclear how identity can help with incidents like the Bitstamp hack where KYC was already in place for customers. Requiring all transactions to have attached identity information would not be feasible for Bitcoin. In the long term, minimalist secure hardware that has additional policies on top could adequately defend private keys, and very tight hot wallets that risk analyze instructions have been proposed in the past. The lack of such hardware currently exists primarily due to implementation lagging behind ideas, but the Bitstamp event may spur development forward.The author suggests that the proposal of an optional identity layer should be provided to allow billions of dollars of value to flow through Bitcoin, which should be modeled after the Internet itself. It could potentially allow for the legacy financial system to migrate to a more regulated sidechain with a stronger identity layer. Market forces should regulate the nexus between custodial and non-custodial address spaces, similar to the rules currently governing coin issuance. The author also suggests that the development of new technologies for securing private keys should move forward in light of recent events, such as the Bitstamp hack.</p>
