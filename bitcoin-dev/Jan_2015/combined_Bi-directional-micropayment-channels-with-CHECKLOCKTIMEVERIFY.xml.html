        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn expresses his view that Bitcoin needs to be able to withstand attacks from malicious miners who may try to break the system in order to gain more money. He explains that even a small percentage of malicious miners could be enough for an attacker to have success. There is objective proof that substantial miners have behaved maliciously in the past. However, he also acknowledges that compromises may sometimes be necessary, and he outlines a risk analysis approach that prioritizes absolute soundness, followed by cryptographic, economic, and honesty soundness.Hearn argues that trust is a major issue in security and privacy, and history has shown that people can convince themselves of justifications for violating trust. He believes that cryptographic tools can offer stronger assurances and cut out most of the trust issues. He also warns against ignoring known risks and emphasizes the importance of being cautious about compromises.In another email, Hearn challenges the idea that micropayment channels can only flow in one direction, pointing out that the original protocol as designed by Satoshi did not have this limitation. However, he disagrees with the idea of expecting replacement solutions to work and be enforced, arguing that this is unsafe.</p>
