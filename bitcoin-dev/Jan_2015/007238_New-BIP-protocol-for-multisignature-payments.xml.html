    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Martin Habovštiak shared his thoughts on how to solve the security problems of servers holding large amounts of bitcoins. He suggested an idea that is an extension of BIP70 and supports the making of multisig transactions dynamically. The user provides their address as the most important thing. However, Mike Hearn replied to Martin saying that he was on the right track but his write-up was similar to the high-level overview given in the Bitcoin wiki. To make 2-of-3 dispute mediation work requires implementing a wallet that supports it and the tools mediators need to manage incoming tickets. The BIP70 extension is probably the smallest part of the project. Martin responded that he knew about the wiki page and just wanted to design a protocol that would make it easier to use. He also wanted feedback from the community.</p>
