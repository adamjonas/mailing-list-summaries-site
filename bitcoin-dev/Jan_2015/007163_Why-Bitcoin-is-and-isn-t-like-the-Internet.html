    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message suggests that third-party and web wallets are no longer viable, as they can burn customers and divulge their data to governments and corporations. The author urges those managing bitcoin.org to reconsider the criteria for what is posted on the website, suggesting that the "web wallet" section should be removed, with the exception of CoinKite, which has made advances in privacy and merits usage by people. Additionally, the author recommends only a few wallets, namely Electrum, Mycelium, Core, and hardware wallets Trezor and HW1. The author further states that there is a major crossroad ahead regarding a suitable platform for the average non-technical mainstream user in Bitcoin. Two extremes currently exist: do-it-yourself security and privacy, or let a third-party service do it for you. The author believes multisig solutions did not really increase security and that creating true two-factor authentication/authorization schemes can improve personal security dramatically to a point where third-party wallet services will become a thing of the past. Finally, the author urges those working for Coinbase customer operations or Bitpay to resign from their employment, suggesting their skills are in high demand elsewhere. A link is provided to Alon Muroch's bitcoinauthenticator.org protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy and a new social good.</p>
