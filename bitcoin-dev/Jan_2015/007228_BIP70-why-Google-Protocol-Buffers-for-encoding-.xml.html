    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>JSON is a common data format but it has been known to generate bugs due to the lack of type marshalling and input validation. This issue has been addressed by Protobufs, msgpack, and other similar data formats that automatically engineer type support and input validation into their designs. This is because field experience has shown that these areas are constant sources of bugs and inconsistent parsing/validation behavior. However, some developers argue that it is not worth creating a JSON-to-schema marshall because dealing with only three types (bytes, int, and string) does not require extensive cross-platform libraries like protobufs. Additionally, JSON libraries are more widespread and supported than protobufs. Some have also attempted to use third-party services to convert data to JSON, but this has been met with criticism for being an unnecessary and high-effort solution.</p>
