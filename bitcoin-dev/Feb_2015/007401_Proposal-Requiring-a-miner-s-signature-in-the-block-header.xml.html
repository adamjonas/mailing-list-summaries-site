    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email proposes a solution to the issue of centralisation in mining, which poses potential risks to users if pool operators were to hold them hostage and change rules. The proposal suggests that each miner signs the block header before hashing, with the signature included in the data that is hashed. In addition, the coinbase for the block would only pay out to the public key counterpart of the private key used to sign the block header. This would prevent cooperating pools of miners who do not trust each other from controlling block rewards, as they would be controlled by disparate parties rather than the pool operator. However, some argue that increasing technical trust requirements would not necessarily help the issue, and the proposed solution may break P2Pool. Others suggest that threshold signatures could be used by an actual distrusting pool's miners to still work together.</p>
