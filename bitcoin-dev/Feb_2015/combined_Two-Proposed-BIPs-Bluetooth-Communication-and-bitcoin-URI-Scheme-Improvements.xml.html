        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchange on the bitcoin-development mailing list revolved around various proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that aim to implement the payment protocol using Bluetooth connections. The proposals are modeled after Andreas Schildbach's Android Bitcoin Wallet's Bluetooth capability, and there is an additional parameter added to the bitcoin: URI scheme, which applies to both Bluetooth and HTTP payment protocol requests allowing for a hash of the payment request to be included. However, known issues with the Bluetooth communication scheme and general payment protocol need to be addressed. These include inconsistencies in connection header messages between payment request and payment connection, unauthenticated Bluetooth connections for newer devices subject to man-in-the-middle attacks and older devices being unsecure and unauthenticated.One proposed implementation involves using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, designed for always-on broadcast "beacons" similar to NFC tags with very low power requirements. The discussion also touched on the need for a person-to-person payment protocol for BLE that is resistant to spoofing and vandalism, using EC signing of nonces. Several proposals were put forward to address these issues, such as adding a new optional boolean field to the PaymentDetails portion of the PaymentRequest to enable the payer's wallet to match output amounts as the total amount of all outputs rather than requiring each output amount to match precisely. Other topics discussed include alternatives to the proposed solution, such as reversing the order of the parameter numbers in the payment_url compared to the bitcoin URL "r parameter" or creating a new payment_url_multi repeated field for future use. There are also discussions about the use of SSL on Bluetooth connections, the trustworthiness of HTTPS and outsourcing payment processing, and the need for dedicated blockchain access. The email conversation highlights some known issues that could be improved in the Bluetooth communication scheme along with the general payment protocol. For instance, Eric Voskuil discussed the main advantage of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) over Bluetooth (BT), stating that BLE uses significantly less power with a trade-off in lower bandwidth. Verification of bitcoin payments on the breadwallet app for Apple devices is faster than on the Android version of the app, possibly due to a more optimized signature verification algorithm. The author seeks feedback from wallet developers and others on these proposals as widespread Bluetooth support among wallets is very important to them. Finally, there were discussions about the amount of data stored in QR codes and the limit of offline transactions of a wallet. The email also provides links to the goparallel.sourceforge.net website and the mailing list's subscription page.</p>
