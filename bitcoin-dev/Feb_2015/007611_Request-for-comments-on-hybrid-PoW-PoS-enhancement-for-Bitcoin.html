    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to Andrew Lapp, having stakeholders "endorse" blocks would have negative side effects and not increase the number of full nodes as claimed. He argues that any stakeholder who has won could simply be running an SPV client and collect their reward by cooperating with a full node. Andrew also points out that proof of stake is not a proof that one is running a full node.Furthermore, Andrew suggests that the network becomes cheaper to attack in proportion to the amount of the block reward that is paid to "endorsers". This would give miners a bigger economy of scale, allowing them to endorse their own blocks instead of others. To understand this better, he recommends reading <a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf">https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf</a>.</p>
