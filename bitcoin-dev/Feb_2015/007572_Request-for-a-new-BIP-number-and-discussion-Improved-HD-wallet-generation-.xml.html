    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jona, the owner of the PGP public key block mentioned in the context, is a skilled developer who has been working on various projects related to data encryption and security. He has recently updated an algorithm to include b in the derivation of a and vice versa. In the comment section of the gist, jhoenicke pointed out that a derivation was not including b at all, making colluding derivation weak to 1 leaked descendant private node. Jona plans to write out how to compromise the parent private node with two child private nodes and the parent public node once he gets home, hoping that writing it out will help give an understanding of any other hidden tricks. In addition to this project, Jona has put together a proposal for a new generation methodology of HD wallets, which is a modification of BIP32. He welcomes any criticism and help with writing/making the BIP more secure. The link to the proposal is shared below.Finally, Jona also shared his PGP public key block, which can be used for secure communication and encryption purposes. The purpose of sending the key block via email as an attachment is to enable secure communication between two parties who want to exchange sensitive information without the risk of interception or eavesdropping.</p>
