    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of OCaml-bitcoin, a library offering an OCaml interface to the official Bitcoin client API, has requested that Bitcoin developers define more precisely the type information associated with each API call in the JSON-RPC reference. This would make writing bindings easier and less prone to errors, as well as better documenting the Bitcoin Core source-code itself. The author has provided examples of the type definitions used in OCaml-bitcoin and notes that they have not been updated for Bitcoin Core 0.10 yet. The author also answered some questions raised on IRC regarding the importance of defining types, stating that deep down most programming errors are just type errors. The author concludes by thanking the Bitcoin developers for their work and expressing appreciation for their efforts.</p>
