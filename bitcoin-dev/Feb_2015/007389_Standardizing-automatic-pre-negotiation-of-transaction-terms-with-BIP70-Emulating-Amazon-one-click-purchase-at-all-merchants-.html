    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the idea of using a wallet or browser extension to inform users if an international webshop ships to their country before they start adding items to their cart. However, some have raised concerns about the privacy implications of such a feature. The argument is that the webshop may already detect the user's location and inform them if they ship to that country, so why should the wallet be involved? Additionally, there are concerns about sharing personal information (such as shipping address) with every webshop without explicit consent. The wallet should prioritize convenience only as much as it allows for better security and privacy.</p>
