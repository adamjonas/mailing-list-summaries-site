        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 1, 2015, a user named xor inquired about the release of version 0.9.4 of Bitcoin.org's binaries and expressed concern about the lack of a release candidate before the official release. However, it was explained that the changes had been tested by several people as part of git master, and version 0.9.4 was released to address an issue that hadn't affected previous versions of the binaries. The release was a narrow bug fix backport designed to prevent the software from ceasing to work for individuals who compiled it themselves and received updates for their system. The message conveyed that the release of version 0.9.4 was not a cause for concern.In a communication on Sunday, February 1st, 2015, Wladimir discussed the details of a tag in git called v0.9.4, which was built as a workaround for a change in OpenSSL that had caused issues. The releases are statically built against OpenSSL, so it is not necessary to upgrade if you use releases from bitcoin.org. Therefore, there was no change on the site. The tag v0.9.4 can be used by people building from source or distribution packages such as the Ubuntu PPA, which unwisely dynamically link OpenSSL. In response to a question about whether there was a release candidate before the tag, Wladimir responded that there had been no 0.9.4 release, neither a release candidate nor anything else. He emphasized that testing and such should be focused on the 0.10 release candidates.There are two questions posed in the context regarding the absence of a release candidate and concerns about safety. However, it is unclear what exactly was released without a candidate version beforehand, and there is also no mention of who made the decision to release without a candidate version. Additionally, there is an attachment included in the context which appears to be a signature, but no information is provided about its relevance to the rest of the text.</p>
