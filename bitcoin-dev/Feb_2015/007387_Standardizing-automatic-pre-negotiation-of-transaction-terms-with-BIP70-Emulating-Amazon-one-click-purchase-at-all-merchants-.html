    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Amazon's payment process, the concept of BIP70 is introduced. BIP70 involves communicating the terms of the sale between the buyer and seller before the payment process begins. This includes information such as whether the seller ships to the buyer's country. By using BIP70, a wallet or browser extension can inform the buyer immediately if they are able to shop at a particular webshop or not, saving time for both parties. The implementation of BIP70 benefits buyers by providing them with essential information before they begin filling their cart, ultimately leading to a smoother transaction process.</p>
