    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, it is mentioned that there is no requirement for P2P communication and one can simply pay to an address they already have for the other party. To prevent address reuse, stealth addressing can be used. However, if someone doesn't have a stealth address for the other party, they can communicate in private as peers where trust is shared in a public key. The main issue here is bootstrapping trust in an ad-hoc manner.It is also suggested that something interactive might be better to avoid paying to an address that the payee no longer has access to. This can lead to situations where the private key is lost, and the payee generates a new wallet.</p>
