    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about BIP70, which exists for seller non-repudiation and establishing strong seller identity in a face-to-face or other non-web scenario. It is not just about payment but also about communication of the terms of the sale. For example, if someone is visiting an international webshop, but they don't ship to their country, with BIP70, their wallet/browser extension could tell them right away that they can't shop there, saving time. This is just one requirement of many where being told right away if it is acceptable for both parties or not would be beneficial. However, some people might find it intrusive if their wallet prompted them because they visited a website.</p>
