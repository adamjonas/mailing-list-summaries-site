    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email correspondence on February 12, 2015, Mike Hearn discusses the concept of replace-by-fee (RBF) and its potential fraudulent outcomes. RBF allows a user to increase the fee of a transaction after it has already been sent, which could potentially lead to double-spending. In this scenario, a wallet could send a double spend with higher fees to some nodes simultaneously, while merchants would likely catch and reject most attempts. However, in a setup where customers are anonymous and distant, this scheme could continue. Miners would then have difficulty acting "honestly" on a statistical measure. The email was sent to Tamas Blummer.</p>
