    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Airbitz wallet can only broadcast information when it is in receive mode. The name section is designed for recipients to broadcast their name or handle, not for the sender to broadcast their name. In response to concerns about privacy and potential payment spam, the CEO and Co-founder of Airbitz, Paul Puey, suggests that Bluetooth MAC addresses are random and not useful identifiers, and that a face is a more uniquely identifying feature than a MAC address. He also suggests that wallets can require signed payment requests and blacklist spammers if necessary. The Airbitz wallet can be downloaded from their website.</p>
