    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the security of multiple signatures in Bitcoin transactions. The original email suggests that having three signatures is pointless if they are not segregated in a secure manner, as using the same computer to access both factors does not increase security. An example given is compromising a computer with an authenticated Google account which can remotely install an app on the phone. Brian Erdelyi responds, stating that the benefit of multiple signatures is reduced if the secrets lose independence in the threat scenario, leading users to believe in a false promise while suffering reduced utility from greater complexity. However, he acknowledges the utility of finding methods to verify high-risk transactions before completion, while balancing user convenience. They discuss the potential for malware targeting Bitcoin and the need for more secure methods. Finally, Brian provides a link to the Go Parallel Website for parallel software development and encourages joining the conversation.</p>
