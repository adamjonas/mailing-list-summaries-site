    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a new generation methodology of HD wallets has been put together by Jona. The proposed method is a modification of BIP32 to make the HD wallet more secure so that leakage of private keys does not destroy the entire wallet. Instead of increasing the number of keys needed up to m and protecting against m-1 leaks, the author decided to leave it at 2 keys protecting 1 leak and then use convention to prevent calculating the master private key by requiring all private keys and all extended private keys (aka "nodes" in my proposal) to be derived alone under their respective parents. In theory, this will prevent any linear relationships between keys from being broken. The proposal also includes an invitation to Cryptographers to review the math and give a second opinion on its soundness.The context provided appears to be a public key in PGP format. The key is a long string of characters and numbers that is used for secure communication and encryption. The key includes a signature block, which is a way to verify the authenticity of the key. In addition to the key itself, there is also an HTML attachment included in the context, but it has been scrubbed and no further information is available about its contents. Overall, this context provides a glimpse into the world of secure communication and encryption, highlighting the importance of digital security in today's interconnected world.</p>
