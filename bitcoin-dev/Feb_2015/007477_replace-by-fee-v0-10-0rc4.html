    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Tamas Blummer and Alex Mizrahi, they discussed the use of getrawmempool RPC call to synchronize mempool contents. However, Tamas explained that the RPC interface does not scale well to serve a multi-user service, so in the absence of a better alternative, the interfaces used by a proprietary extension are usually the same as in P2P consensus. POW is used to determine the longest chain, and broadcasted transactions were assumed to be the one and only transaction. These simple rules ensure a consensus between the proprietary stack and the border router.Peter Todd pointed out that if the proprietary stack has problems with replace-by-fee, it is susceptible to malicious attacks because an attacker could broadcast one transaction to the network and then replace it when they mine a block themselves. Tamas agreed that the assumption about the one and only transaction needed to be relaxed, and suggested broadcasting double spend only if it is actually replacing an earlier transaction for whatever reason. This would simplify internal consensus logic.</p>
