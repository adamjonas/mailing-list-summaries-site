    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are two questions posed in the given context. Firstly, it is asked why there was no release candidate before the release of something. Secondly, the safety of this decision is being questioned. The absence of a release candidate is being considered as risky by the person asking the question. It is unclear what exactly was released without a candidate version beforehand. There is also no mention of who made the decision to release without a candidate version. Apart from these questions, there is an attachment included in the context which appears to be a signature. However, there is no information provided about what this signature pertains to or its relevance to the rest of the text.</p>
