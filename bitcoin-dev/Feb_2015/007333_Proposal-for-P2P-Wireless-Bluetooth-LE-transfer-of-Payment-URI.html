    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation begins with concern over the possibility of using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for mass surveillance through facial recognition in highly populated areas. However, another participant in the conversation points out that BLE technology has poor propagation and is unlikely to enable mass surveillance anytime soon. The focus of the conversation then shifts to discussing ideas for faster user interfaces, including the use of wifi hotspots to trigger BLE. Returning to the original topic, there is a debate about the feasibility of implementing BLE technology for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). It is suggested that at least another wallet would need to implement it before it becomes a BIP. Despite concerns about the flakiness of prefix matching, it is difficult to determine if payments could actually be stolen without trying it.</p>
