    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and an unknown individual, the topic of Bitcoin (BT) publication was discussed. Specifically, whether it requires BT publication of the script for a P2SH address. The individual responded by asking if this was in reference to a URI that included a bitcoin address. Mike Hearn confirmed that would be the case, and went on to explain that in such a scenario, the server would indicate both the script and the key within that script that it wanted to use. However, he noted that this would make the process a bit more complex.The conversation then shifted to the idea of "re-using" fallback addresses, which one of the participants expressed reservations about. They suggested that it might be better to add their own parameter instead and let go of fallback addresses as soon as possible. This idea was met with agreement from the other participant, who acknowledged that doing so might take up extra space during the transition period but would ultimately make no difference.</p>
