    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoinj list has been discussing the lack of privacy provision in the current implementation parameters, with some real-world factors similar to those described in an academic paper. Mike responded to the discussion explaining that it is complex and bandwidth inefficient to improve privacy. Essentially, the implementation is not intended to provide practical privacy protection; it is just about compacting the query for a set of addresses. However, someone suggested on the bitcoin wizards IRC that instead of using the current system, a bloom filter of the addresses in the block could be committed to which would address the privacy issues. This would allow users to fetch the block bloom filters and scan them in complete privacy. The next step would be fetching the candidate TXOs.</p>
