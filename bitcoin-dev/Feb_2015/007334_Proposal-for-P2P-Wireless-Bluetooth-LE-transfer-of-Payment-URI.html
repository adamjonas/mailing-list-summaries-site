    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has an advertised range of over 100m, which could be extended through mass surveillance. However, the radio technology used by BLE runs in the "junk bands," and its propagation is poor, making it difficult to enable mass surveillance. WiFi hotspots don't have strong identity or a guaranteed position, so they can't be trusted for location. The debate about this topic is interesting, but it would require at least another wallet to implement it as a BIP. Nevertheless, the prefix matching still feels flaky, and it's hard to know if payments could be swiped out of the air in practice without trying it.</p>
