    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion involves the feasibility of having a website display shipping information to a specific country before any action is taken. One concern raised is that IP isn't always reliable due to VPN or Tor usage. While the site can display all options right away, not everyone may be willing to read through everything. The suggestion is to prompt users with a popup that has a slider to choose the level of information to share, including none if desired. Raw data doesn't need to be shared as anonymous credentials can be used. It's also suggested to wait for prompting until the first item is added to the cart.</p>
