    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on 02/02/2015, a user vv01f expressed their preference for using a human-readable date format YYYYMMDD in Bitcoin strings. However, another user argued that Bitcoin deals with seconds since epoch and therefore, a more complicated date format is unnecessary. Vv01f argued that using a human-readable date format saves storage space and suggested that an 8 character timestamp can easily be identified as the proposed format. The user also suggested that having a transparent, human-readable option is always beneficial. Another user, Pavol, suggested using a date format that saves two characters, which was later challenged by vv01f who argued that precise creation dates should be used. Finally, vv01f agreed to use a human-readable date format if it is preferred by the majority of users.</p>
