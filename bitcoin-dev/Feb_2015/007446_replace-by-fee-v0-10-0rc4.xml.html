    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The thread discusses the controversy around replace-by-fee (RBF) in Bitcoin transactions. Alan Reiner believes RBF is good for long-term use, however, Justus Ranvier disagrees and asserts that relying on altruism is not a solution. The discussion also touches upon the safety of zero-confirmation transactions, with Justus Ranvier noting that it's a non-binary risk analysis on the part of a merchant. Additionally, assumptions about what is profitable for miners are based on all miners having short time horizons for calculating profits. The child-pays-for-parent solution is proposed as an alternative to RBF, which allows stuck transactions to be cleared from the mempool, and allows recipients of zero-conf transactions to adjust their risk exposure as much or as little as they like. Finally, the email ends with a call for support of online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible and a link to the Go Parallel Website.</p>
