    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Verification of bitcoin payments on the breadwallet app for Apple devices is faster than on the Android version of the app, possibly due to a more optimised signature verification algorithm. It is suggested that the slower verification process on Android may be because it is being verified in Java instead of C++, although this could be fixed. X.509 cert chains are mentioned as being bloated, but even with their size the transfer time should not take several seconds, even over Bluetooth. The current Bluetooth connection may cause a one second delay in transferring data, but it is unknown how slow it will be with a BLE connection.</p>
