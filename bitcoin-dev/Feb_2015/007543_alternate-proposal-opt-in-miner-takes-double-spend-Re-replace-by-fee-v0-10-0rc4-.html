    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from February 2015, Adam Back stated that he wanted to explore ways to improve practical security of fast confirmation transactions and only deprecate the current weaker 0-conf transactions if a better alternative is found. He also mentioned his advocacy for similar proposals in various forms for years, including to hold fidelity bonded banks honest, commonly referred to as federated sidechains. Peter Todd responded to this proposal, suggesting that implementing it as a general purpose scripting language improvement has several advantages, such as not relying entirely on inherently unreliable P2P networking. Todd argued that blowing up 0-confirm transactions is not vandalism and provided several analogies to explain his point. He further asked if releasing a version of Bitcoin Core with different IsStandard() rules than the previous version, mining with a different policy than other people, or using replace-by-fee tools is vandalism. Finally, he signed off his email as 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</p>
