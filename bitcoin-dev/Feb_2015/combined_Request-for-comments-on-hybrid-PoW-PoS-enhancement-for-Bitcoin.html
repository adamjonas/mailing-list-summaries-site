        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Chris proposes a new scheme to incentivize running full nodes in the Bitcoin network. The proposal aims to accommodate new users interested in earning Bitcoin through mining and increase the number of full nodes, ultimately making the blockchain more secure. However, there are gaps in the idea that require exploration, such as potential attack vectors and the role endorsers could play in identifying possible double-spends.Under this proposed scheme, nodes would broadcast an endorsement message endorsing the block as valid and preferred. Miners would add endorsements of B0 to B1's coinbase transaction, sharing the block reward with endorsers of B0. To encourage miners to include endorsement payouts, a change to the best chain selection algorithm is required. A block should receive a significant bonus to its work for each valid endorsement payout included in a block's valid coinbase transaction. This makes a sustained 51% attack more expensive.Endorsement rewards would be as much as 20% of the block reward, shared evenly between all endorsers included in the coinbase. When a new block is broadcast, miners will begin assembling yet another block. Meanwhile, full nodes would validate the new block, and endorsements would propagate quickly thereafter to all miners. The implementation of Block Endorsement would provide an incentive for more full nodes, ultimately encouraging Bitcoin adoption. The success of the proposal depends on further exploration of the potential attack vectors and the role endorsers could play in identifying possible double-spends. Mike provides feedback, stating that he does not see how Chris's proposal is different from actual mining and questions the difficulty of distinguishing full node sybils from each other. Chris acknowledges that he needs to be more crisp in his description of why his scheme is better than mining.Overall, Chris Page's proposal for Block Endorsement aims to improve security, increase the number of full nodes, and provide more avenues for bitcoin distribution through a new message system that fits into current structures. The proposal includes details on how the endorsement system would work and its potential impact on 51% attacks and mining strategies. Feedback from the community will be crucial in determining how to proceed with implementation or recommending a new BIP.</p>
