    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion was made to implement a 2-of-3 dispute mediation transaction in an existing or new bitcoin-based wallet. The implementation would start as a specialist one, and eventually, the protocol, UI ideas, and code could be integrated into general-purpose wallets. Mike Hearn offered pointers on how to implement it. Creating a cross-platform app-specific wallet is relatively easy these days. Gavin Andresen agreed that standards should be descriptive rather than proscriptive. Mike Hearn suggested pairing a protocol spec with an implementation. Martin Habovštiak expressed interest in implementing it but said he did not have time for it at the moment. Wallet and server-side implementations will be based on existing code in a friendly language such as C++ or Python. A good opportunity for implementation may be the Crypto hackathon in Parallel Polis.</p>
