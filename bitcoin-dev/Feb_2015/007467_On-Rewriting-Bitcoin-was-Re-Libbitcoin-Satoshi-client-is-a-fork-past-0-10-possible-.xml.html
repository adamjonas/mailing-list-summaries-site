    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion, Adam Back advises against using software with consensus protocol rw-writes or variants as it could lead to loss of money due to the complex nature of maintaining strict consensus between Bitcoin versions. He suggests using and rallying around libconsensus instead. The discussion also includes Tamas Blummer's response to Peter Todd's suggestion of getting the consensus critical code out of Bitcoin Core and into a stand-alone libconsensus library. Blummer believes that a consensus library cannot be separated from Bitcoin Core, less its P2P service rules, wallet, and RPC server due to the criticality of the code and legacy design. He also discusses his focus on innovation that uses the core as a border router for the blockchain and expresses gratitude for the ideas of side chains that enable innovation not measured on unapologetic compatibility with a given code base but its services to end-users.</p>
