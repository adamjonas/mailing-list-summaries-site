    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on February 23, 2015, Andy Schroder and another person discussed the security of Near Field Communication (NFC) communication. Schroder questioned whether NFC communication could be considered private due to the ease with which an eavesdropper could place a snooping device nearby and read the communication passively without the merchant or operator realizing it's there. The other person had suggested putting the session key in the URL but Schroder was hesitant about this approach. They both agreed that "trust by proximity" was the best option available since other options like speaking the session key out loud would be bad for user experience and could also be eavesdropped upon.</p>
