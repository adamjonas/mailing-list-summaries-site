    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the scalability of blockchain technology, Wladimir notes that the everyone-validates-everything approach is useful for settling larger transactions in an irreversible, zero-trust way, but it doesn't scale. He argues that it's absurd for the whole world to have to validate every purchase of a cup of coffee or a bus ticket by six billion others. In response, someone points out that nobody suggested 6 billion full nodes and Gavin makes the point that it would be unwise to artificially limit the number of transactions below the technical capabilities of the network. He argues that limiting transactions could cause competition to be lost. The comment from Gavin can be found in a blog post he wrote on the topic.</p>
