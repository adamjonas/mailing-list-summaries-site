    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal put forth by Tom Harding to strengthen the incentive not to confirm double-spends after a certain time has been criticized as dangerous and foolish. The proposal opens up the Bitcoin network to serious vulnerabilities, both from attackers outside the network and miners trying to gain an advantage over their competition. Additionally, the p2p network is not a reliable broadcast medium, making it difficult to guarantee that all nodes have seen a transaction. Moreover, the proposal creates incentives to launch attacks on smaller mining operations that are victims of attacks on their network connectivity. It also makes it easier to pull off single-confirm double-spend attacks. This forces everyone to wait longer before accepting a transaction because even a single confirmation is no longer good evidence of an accepted transaction. If this idea gets traction, it should serve as a warning to all miners that it's time they adopt replace-by-fee to set a clear precedent that they have no obligations other than the same economic self-interest. Appeals to authority are also discouraged in the proposal, as referencing stuff from a time when Bitcoin was barely understood can lead to people ignoring the idea.Tom Harding's proposal involves changing the disincentive from a simple delay to a temporary chain work penalty, which can be negative. The penalty is graduated in two steps based on the respend gap, for reasons explained within. The proposal is explained in detail in the link provided to the Double-Spend Deprecation Window.</p>
