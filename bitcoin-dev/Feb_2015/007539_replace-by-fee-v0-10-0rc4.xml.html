    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Eric Lombrozo proposed a solution to the problem of double-spending in Bitcoin, which involves distinguishing between fee replacement and output replacement. In instances where outputs are kept but not all, it is difficult to determine whether the motivation was fee or output replacement. Lombrozo suggests always treating these cases as output replacement and punishing the sender, unless they make it clear that it's only fee replacement by creating a new transaction with an output that includes the desired extra fee and adding an input to spend it to the original transaction. This proposal requires a change to the consensus rules, but Lombrozo argues that it is necessary for Bitcoin to scale. In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jeff Garzik argued that many use insecure 0-conf transactions for rapid payments and that deploying a solution that makes 0-conf transactions unusable would have a negative impact on present-day Bitcoin payments. However, he acknowledged the need for a security upgrade for instant payments. Lombrozo's proposal aims to address this issue by distinguishing between fee and output replacement and punishing senders who engage in output replacement.</p>
