    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author discusses the use of UTXO commitments/anti-fraud proofs, stating that while they would be useful in the future, they are not critical to current protocols and are proving to be a distraction. The author then discusses technical issues with a proposed solution involving per-block Bloom filtering and requesting individual transactions from random peers. They argue that this method would not be efficient or effective due to problems with parallelization and detection of unpredictable data. Additionally, the author argues that this solution does not solve any real problems, as commercial fraudsters are unlikely to use it, and spies could still correlate data using DPI. The author suggests that opportunistic encryption of the wire protocol would be a simpler and more effective solution. They also discuss practical problems with using Tor for privacy, including slow boot-up time, potential for blocking by malicious actors, and vulnerability to tampering by trolls.</p>
