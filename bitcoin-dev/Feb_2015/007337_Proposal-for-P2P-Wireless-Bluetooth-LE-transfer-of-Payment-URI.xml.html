    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Paul and Mike revolves around the issue of trust in broadcasting information. The broadcast is only done when the wallet is in Receive mode, and the use of the *Name* section is specifically for the recipient to broadcast their name/handle, not the sender's. Mike expresses concerns about walking around broadcasting his photo and MAC address while hucksters push payment requests for approval. However, Paul points out that people already broadcast their face every time they walk outside, and Bluetooth MAC addresses are random and not useful identifiers. While "payment spam" may be a potential issue, it could be solved by requiring signed requests and blacklisting spammers. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of establishing trust in the broadcasting of information.</p>
