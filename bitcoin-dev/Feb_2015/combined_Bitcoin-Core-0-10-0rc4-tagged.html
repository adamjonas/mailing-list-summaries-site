        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 5th, 2015, Wladimir announced the tagging of v0.10rc4 and pushed his signatures to the gitian.sigs repository. He requested for the Gitian builders to be started, and there was a quick response with 9 gitian builders already in operation. As a result, the executables and tarball for rc4 have been uploaded to the usual place at <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.10.0/test/.The">https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.10.0/test/.The</a> changes relative to rc3 include an increase in block download timeout base from 10 to 20 minutes, increased coverage of DERSIG edge cases, and a BIP66 changeover logic. Other changes in this release candidate are example unit tests from BIP66, a fix for priority calculation in CreateTransaction, avoidance of storing a reference passed to SignatureChecker constructors, separate SignatureChecker for CMutableTransaction, and not allowing amount changes when AmountSpinBox is read-only in Qt.There are also various other fixes and improvements in this version. Coin Control first column label was changed, there is now a sleep-wait on the genesis block during initialization with -reindex, empty byte arrays now pass CheckSignatureEncoding(), and there is a fix for the CoinControl "space" bug. Additionally, QT was fixed with broken unicode characters on osx 10.10, and new options were added such as an -rpckeepalive option to disable RPC use of HTTP persistent connections.This may be the last release candidate before the 0.10 final release.</p>
