    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Adam Back and Wladimir, a potential solution to improve the privacy of Bitcoin transactions was discussed. The idea involves inverting the bloom filter by committing it to a block header, allowing users to fetch the block bloom filters and scan them for complete privacy. This approach would also lower the burden for nodes and eliminate the transaction withholding attack possible with current bloom filtering. However, the drawback is that the bloom filter per block would have significant size, which would increase overhead. Despite this, the impact may not be so bad in practice since the percentage of blocks containing transactions for a given wallet is generally low. If block size were increased, this solution could become less effective.</p>
