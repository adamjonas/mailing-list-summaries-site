    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Tamas Blummer and Peter Todd dated February 12, 2015, Todd made a suggestion about treating every transaction from the "border router" as the one and only true transaction. However, Blummer pointed out that this assumption had to be relaxed and broadcasting double spend only if it was replacing an earlier transaction would simplify internal consensus logic. Todd then asked how his replace-by-fee patch did not already do that. The conversation ended with Todd's signature and digital signature attachment.</p>
