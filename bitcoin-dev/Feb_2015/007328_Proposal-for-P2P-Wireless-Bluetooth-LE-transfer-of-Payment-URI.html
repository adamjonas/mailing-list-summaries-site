    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 5th, 2015, a discussion took place between Mike Hearn, Paul Puey, and Andreas Schildbach regarding the use of Bitcoin for P2P payments. Hearn expressed concerns about the potential for confused payments in certain situations, while Puey suggested the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to enable payment without internet connectivity. Schildbach suggested skipping "bitcoin:" URIs entirely and using BIP70 payment requests instead to address the "copycat" problem. The group also discussed the usability issues of NFC and the potential for broadcasting payment requests to be a better solution in certain scenarios. They also discussed the coffee shop use case and proposed a Square-style UI where the device broadcasts a photo of the user combined with a Bluetooth MAC, allowing the merchant tablet to push a payment request to the user's device with minimal interaction required.</p>
