    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Paul Puey, CEO and co-founder of Airbitz Inc, discusses the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for Bitcoin transactions. While BLE doesn't preclude the use of BIP70, it allows individuals without a certificate to broadcast a request. The issue of confused payments can be mitigated by having the recipient broadcast a name along with their public address prefix, which could be displayed on a customer-facing screen at a coffee shop or other retail establishment. In response to a suggestion about using NFC for Bitcoin transactions, Puey explains that NFC is clunky due to issues with Android devices, and that BLE allows people to pay at a distance. BLE is particularly useful in areas with poor 3G/4G connectivity, as it enables payment without internet access by transferring URIs between sender and recipient. Puey suggests that a Square-style UI could make point-of-sale transactions easier by enabling the merchant tablet to show faces of people in the shop and push a payment request to the user's device.</p>
