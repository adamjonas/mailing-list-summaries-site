    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the use of a simple or complex method to transfer a session key. The suggestion was made to use ECDHE to set up an encrypted channel, as it allows for reuse of URIs and provides unique session keys even in low tech scenarios. It also allows for the derivation of both a MAC key and an AES key, avoiding the need to exchange both. The h= parameter was objected to as it adds complexity and uses space, but may be necessary for unsigned payment requests. The author suggests upgrading Andreas' wallet to support encrypted connections and TBIPs to test the approach. Ultimately, the focus is on creating a working solution rather than endless debate over details.</p>
