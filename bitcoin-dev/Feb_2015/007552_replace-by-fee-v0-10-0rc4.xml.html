    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd has released a replace-by-fee patch for the v0.10.0rc4 release on Github. While this patch simplifies successful double-spends of unconfirmed transactions, it does not provide sufficient means to detect and relay double-spends. This makes it difficult to trigger a scorched-earth reaction since not all double-spends will conform to the replacement rules. There is uncertainty if senders or receivers will ever use scorched-earth as a double-spend deterrent. Furthermore, this patch weakens DoS protections by removing the early conflict check, making all conflict processing more expensive. Additionally, there is no attempt to protect against the same transaction being continually replaced with the fee bumped by a minimal amount.</p>
