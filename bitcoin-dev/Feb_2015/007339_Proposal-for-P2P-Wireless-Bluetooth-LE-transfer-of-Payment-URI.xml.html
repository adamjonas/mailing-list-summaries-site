    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Paul Puey regarding the Airbitz wallet, Voskuil raises concerns over trust issues with the initial information being broadcasted. However, Puey clarifies that the broadcast only occurs when the wallet is in Receive mode and mentions the use of the Name section for the recipient to broadcast their name/handle. Mike Hearn also joins in the conversation, mentioning the issue of "payment spam" but suggests it can be easily tackled by blacklisting spammers. Overall, the conversation revolves around establishing trust within the Airbitz wallet system and dealing with potential issues that may arise.</p>
