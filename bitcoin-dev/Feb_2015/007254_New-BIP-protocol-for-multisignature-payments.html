    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the implementation of a dispute mediation transaction protocol in bitcoinj based wallets. The author mentions that it is relatively easy to create one-off, cross-platform app-specific wallets for this purpose. However, initially, these wallets may be considered specialist and users may need to transfer funds from their general spending wallet to the dispute mediation app. The author offers to provide guidance on implementing this protocol and suggests that eventually, general-purpose wallets could integrate the protocol, UI ideas, and code. The idea is well received by the community and Gavin Andresen suggests that it would be better to pair a protocol spec with an implementation.</p>
