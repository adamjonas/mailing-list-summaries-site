    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in February 2015, Andreas Schildbach suggested using Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) or similar to improve session security. However, another participant argued that DHKE wouldn't help as either a simple or complex method for transferring a session key would still need to be used. The same participant also proposed scenarios related to the use of near-field communication (NFC) for secure payment transactions, highlighting potential privacy issues and suggesting that using public keys received via NFC to encrypt session keys for Bluetooth communication could reduce the risk of eavesdropping. Other participants in the discussion debated the pros and cons of various trust anchors for payment transactions, including proximity to the payment terminal and the need for payer authentication.</p>
