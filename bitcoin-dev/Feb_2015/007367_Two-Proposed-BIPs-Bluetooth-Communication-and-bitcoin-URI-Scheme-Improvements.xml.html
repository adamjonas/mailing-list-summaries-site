    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated 02/06/2015, Eric Voskuil discussed the main advantage of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) over Bluetooth (BT), stating that BLE uses significantly less power with a trade-off in lower bandwidth. However, BLE range can be greater and connection latency lower than BT, making it suitable for payment purposes. Voskuil expressed support for extending the BT scheme to Bluetooth LE, but mentioned that he had not had a chance to experiment with it because none of his devices supported it. He also speculated that if Bluetooth LE transfers files like payment requests by opening a plain old Bluetooth socket, it would not add anything for sending BIP70 messages back and forth. Voskuil emphasized that signed payment requests can easily be 4 kB in size, so speed does matter.</p>
