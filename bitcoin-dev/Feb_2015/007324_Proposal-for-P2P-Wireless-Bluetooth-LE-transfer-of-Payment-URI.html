    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The BIP70 protocol would prevent the use of P2P transfer specifications and require internet connectivity for payment protocol information. BLE technology could enable payment without internet by transferring the URI from recipient to sender via BLE and then signing a Tx and sending it back to the recipient over BLE in the future. NFC is also clunky due to Android issues, and the usage model is worse than scanning a QR code unless the payment recipient has a custom Android device. BLE allows people to pay at a distance such as for a donation to a live performer. For a BIP standard, publishing BIP70 payment requests instead of "bitcoin:" URIs would partly address the copycat problem by signing payment requests. NFC already addresses usability issues, but the use case for preferring broadcasting payment requests over picking them up via near field radio should be explained.</p>
