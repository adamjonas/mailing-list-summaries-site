    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation in this context is about the security concerns related to Near Field Communication (NFC) tap and payment requests. It discusses how privacy can be compromised if the NFC tap is not private enough and how an attacker could capture selected payment requests. The problem of compromising privacy can be resolved by sending a unique public key on each NFC tap. The symmetric key approach is based on the idea that these attacks are comparable in difficulty and otherwise identical in privacy loss. However, it is also discussed that impersonating the payer is just a matter of software and a more sophisticated attacker can set himself up in the same position without subverting the NFC terminal at all. Overall, the conversation emphasizes the importance of maintaining privacy in NFC transactions and suggests strategies to achieve that.</p>
