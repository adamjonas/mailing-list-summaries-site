    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author argues that moral judgments are not sufficient when it comes to building security in the face of potential threats. Using the example of arsonists, he suggests that relying on people to do the right thing is not a reliable security model and that penetration testing is essential to identify weaknesses and limitations that can be improved upon. The author warns against ignoring the existence of potential threats out of benevolence and suggests that Bitcoin needs to deal with these issues by following the rules of the protocol and what is realistically possible, rather than relying on altruism. He compares this approach to passing out fire extinguishers and smoke detectors instead of matches to prevent wooden buildings from catching fire.</p>
