    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient discuss a proposal to treat a Bitcoin address as a secp256k1 public key. The recipient asks for clarification on how this would work, and Mike explains that the server would provide the public key and the client would convert it to address form, then match it against the URI it has scanned. However, there is some confusion about whether this approach also requires the BT publication of the script for a P2SH address. The conversation ends there. A digital signature is attached to the email.</p>
