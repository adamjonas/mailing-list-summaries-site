    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Mike Hearn expressed his concern regarding broadcasting his photo and MAC address while receiving payment requests from merchants. However, it was pointed out that a face is a more unique identifier than a MAC address which is random and not useful for identification. It was further questioned whether payment requests would be encrypted with a public key of the spender or broadcast in the clear, potentially leading to "payment spam" as a problem. It was suggested that this could be resolved through blacklisting and spam filtering, but some argued against a system that requires PKI with blacklisting and spam filtering.</p>
