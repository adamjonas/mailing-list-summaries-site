        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context is working on addr relaying for their C# Bitcoin node, named Thashiznets/Lego.NET. They are wiring up their DB in Azure but faced difficulty due to the varying information present in two different specification documents. One document did not mention that version message now has the 4 byte checksum and no time in the net_addrs. The other document provided this information and also stated that Heartbeat is 30 minutes and disconnect is 90 minutes, which the author found more sensible. As a result, they modified their code according to this specification.The author seeks input from other developers about any additional variations between these two specifications they should be aware of. They also mentioned other variations that some of the developers might know about that they need to look out for. The links provided are to the Github repository of Thashiznets/Lego.NET, Developer Reference - Bitcoin on bitcoin.org, and Satoshi Client Node Discovery on en.bitcoin.it.</p>
