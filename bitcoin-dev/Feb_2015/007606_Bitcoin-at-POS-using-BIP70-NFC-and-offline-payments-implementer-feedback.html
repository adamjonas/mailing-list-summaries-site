    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation, dated February 24th, 2015, was about changing the URL semantics of the "bt" scheme and some proposals for it. The main question was whether a resource is relative to the hierarchical path or independent of it and relative to the scheme and naming authority. It was concluded that the proper form would be bt:/ because r=bt:&s= is only valid in the context of the path, not relevant to all s. The discussion continued with the use of Session ID as a parameter in the header, which is derived from the PublicKey, and its format. The non-reuse of public keys was designed to resolve forward secrecy and other problems. They also discussed the message header format and creating a new UUID for the secure service, so existing terminals could maintain backward compatibility. Finally, they discussed getting rid of the resource and using an ID to help the BT terminal identify the session without having to try all of its outstanding keys until it finds one that works.</p>
