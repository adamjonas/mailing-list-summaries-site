    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is about Thashiznets/Lego.NET, a C# Bitcoin node. The focus is addr relaying and the author is wiring up his DB in Azure to start plopping net_addrs in his DB. However, he faced difficulty as he found two different specification documents that seem to be varying wildly. He solved the issue of version message having a 4 byte checksum and no time in the net_addrs. One document said that the heartbeat AND disconnect were 30 minutes, but another document said that Heartbeat is 30 minutes and disconnect is 90 minutes which seemed far more sensible so he modified his code according to this. The author also mentions about other variations between these two specification documents that perhaps some of the devs know about that he needs to look out for. The links provided are to the Github repository of Thashiznets/Lego.NET, Developer Reference - Bitcoin on bitcoin.org, and Satoshi Client Node Discovery on en.bitcoin.it.</p>
