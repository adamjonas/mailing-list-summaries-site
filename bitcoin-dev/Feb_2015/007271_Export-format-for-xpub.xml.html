    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on February 2nd, 2015, Andreas Schildbach stated that the strings in Bitcoin transactions are not meant to be read by humans and therefore there is no need for human-readable timestamps. He suggested that using YYYYMMDD would be more complicated than necessary as Bitcoin deals with seconds since epoch everywhere. However, Pavol disagreed and argued that having a transparent, human-readable option is never wrong, especially when it saves space in QR codes. Additionally, he pointed out that Bitcoin timestamps can never be before January 2009 and will always have ten digits, so an eight-character long timestamp could easily be identified as the proposed format. Despite this, Andreas maintained his position that human-readable timestamps were unnecessary and would waste storage.</p>
