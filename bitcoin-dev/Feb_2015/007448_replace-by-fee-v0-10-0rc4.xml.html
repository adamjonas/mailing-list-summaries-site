    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, stated that scorched-earth solutions are not compatible with decentralized networks. He argued that such solutions could lead to people being unfairly punished for poor connectivity that may be entirely out of their control. Moreover, maintaining a Bitcoin node and mining the blockchain would require a significant amount of hands-on maintenance, which is incompatible with a decentralized system. Therefore, Todd concluded that scorched-earth solutions aren't a good idea after all. In his email signature, Todd encouraged supporting online privacy by using email encryption whenever possible.</p>
