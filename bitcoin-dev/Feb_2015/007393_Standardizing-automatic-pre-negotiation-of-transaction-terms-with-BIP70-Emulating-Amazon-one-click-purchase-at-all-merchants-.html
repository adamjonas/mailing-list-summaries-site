    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2015, Mike Hearn discussed the use of BIP70 extensions for auto-filling shipping addresses. He questioned whether the wallet was the best place to do this and suggested using HTML5 data standards instead to allow merchants to advertise where they ship to in a machine-readable form. The protocol used for this feature doesn't matter much as long as it simplifies implementation. Hearn proposed adding a tag to the HTML form that prompts the Bitcoin wallet about the payment details. One potential solution could be asking a hardware wallet over BLE for this data, which would enable secure auto-fill while minimizing trust in the browsing device.</p>
