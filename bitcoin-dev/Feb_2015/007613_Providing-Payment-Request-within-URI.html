    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin mailing list, Oleg Andreev asked if there is a standard way to put payment request data into a bitcoin: URI or directly into QR code. He was looking for a way to allow a device to generate a multi-output payment request without relying on the server and x509 certificates. The goal was to have something like "bitcoin:?r=data://". Though there isn't a standard for this, he wondered if it would be a good idea to extend BIP72. In response, someone suggested using the Base43 encoding of the payment request in a QR code with "BITCOIN:-" preceding it. This approach is optimized for QR codes and should work well for simple use cases. However, X509 signing or too many outputs could make scanning the QR code difficult. Links to relevant code on GitHub were provided.</p>
