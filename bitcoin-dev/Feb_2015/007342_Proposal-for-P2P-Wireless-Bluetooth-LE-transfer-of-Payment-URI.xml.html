    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer expresses his preference for the simplicity of tapping two phones together for payment. However, he questions if NFC is good enough for secure transactions. He also suggests that tapping two devices together and comparing the timing of the tap could make spoofing a transaction harder. The conversation then shifts to discussing the security concerns around BLE and how it can be used for mass surveillance. One person argues that BLE has an advertised range of over 100m and that it could be extended dramatically by the reviewer in the case of mass surveillance. Another person disagrees, stating that Bluetooth barely goes through air, let alone walls. The discussion then ends with the idea of creating a BIP regardless of the design issues and trying out swiping payments out of the air. Finally, the email signature promotes the Go Parallel website, which is a hub for all things parallel software development.</p>
