    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When it comes to cyber attacks, there are two main attack vectors to consider: the recipient's machine and the sender's machine. If the recipient's machine is compromised, it can lead to a number of security issues. This could include unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of malware or viruses, or even complete control over the machine.On the other hand, if the sender's machine is compromised, it can also have serious consequences. For example, an attacker may use the compromised machine to send phishing emails to unsuspecting recipients, which could result in further security breaches. Additionally, the attacker may be able to gain access to sensitive information stored on the sender's machine, putting both the sender and any recipients at risk.It is important for individuals and organizations alike to take steps to mitigate these risks. This may involve implementing strong security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption protocols. It may also involve educating employees and users about common cyber threats and how to avoid them.In short, whether it's the recipient's machine or the sender's machine that is compromised, the consequences can be serious. By taking proactive steps to protect against these threats, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of falling victim to a cyber attack.</p>
