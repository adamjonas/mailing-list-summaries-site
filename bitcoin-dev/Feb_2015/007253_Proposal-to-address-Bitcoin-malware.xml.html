    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Brian Erdelyi raises concerns about the security of Bitcoin transactions and asks if there is a way to generate an 8-digit number from a Bitcoin address that could be used to verify transactions. He also asks about the ability to verify that the transaction signed by the wallet matches the request before it is sent to the blockchain, and how this could support out-of-band verification. The discussion touches on the use of BIP70 and its effectiveness against man-in-the-middle/man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks, with the caveat that an attacker can still buy from the same merchant with a user’s money. The discussion ends with a suggestion to look into Trezor as a possible solution, but it is unclear whether it supports BIP70. Overall, the discussion highlights ongoing concerns about the security of Bitcoin transactions and the need for continued development of solutions to mitigate risks.</p>
