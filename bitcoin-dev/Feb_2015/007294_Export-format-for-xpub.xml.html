    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on February 2, 2015, Pavol Rusnak proposed a change to the way addresses are discovered in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 32 and BIP 44. He suggested that instead of focusing on how the xpub was created or obtained, the emphasis should be on scanning xpub/0/i and xpub/1/j chains using gap limit G. In order to implement this change, he suggested replacing ?h=bip32 with ?t=01&g=20 where t=01 indicates that chains 0 and 1 should be scanned and g=20 specifies the use of a gap limit of 20. However, another member of the email exchange expressed doubts about parameterizing the process in this way, arguing that it would not work in the future if new BIPs were introduced. They suggested that it would be better to use the BIP number directly, as was done for BIP 43.</p>
