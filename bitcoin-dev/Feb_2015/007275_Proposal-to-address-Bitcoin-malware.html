    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation from 2015, Martin Habovštiak proposed using partially signed transactions from a computer to a smartphone to improve security. He suggested making a 3oo5 address with two cold storage keys - one on a desktop/laptop and the other on a smartphone, with a third key using a third-party service; this would combat paranoia. A similar idea was proposed by someone else in the conversation: using multisig wallets to protect against malware. This involves generating a wallet with three keys, requiring a transaction that has been signed by two of those keys - one placed in cold storage and another sent to a third-party. Companies such as BitGo, CryptoCorp, and GreenAddress offer this model. Additionally, Habovštiak shared a link to a website called Bitcoin Authenticator, which was already implementing his proposed idea and was in alpha testing at the time.</p>
