    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message is questioning whether it is necessary or coincidental that the three databases in Bitcoin (network addresses, block chain, and wallet) are all located in the "datadir" directory. They suggest that it would be more convenient to have them in separate paths for easier backup and transportation. Specifically, the block chain database is noted as being the most important and time-consuming to duplicate and transport. The author questions whether it is possible to back up by only copying files with equal or newer dates, as well as log, current, and manifest files, and suggests initial and incremental backups. These concerns stem from worries about data frailties on operating systems like Windows and the importance of knowing where one's data is located.</p>
