    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin payment protocol, Melvin Carvalho opined that a large entity such as a government or corporation might be able to MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) HTTPS. A potential MITM attack could allow anyone with the ability to turn the SSL PKI infrastructure into untraceable cash. Mike Hearn argued that a URI contains instructions for making a payment and if there is no potential for a MITM attack, then it's no different. The flaws of SSL PKI may be exploited by governments and other large players to harm Bitcoin and give solid evidence that it was broken. It is believed that payment protocol using the SSL PKI infrastructure will help in understanding how it's broken and giving everyone involved good reasons to fix it.</p>
