    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated September 10, 2013, Mark Friedenbach commented on how getting things wrong could backfire. This statement is in relation to Wikipedia's image display problems that persisted for a long time. The images were stored by their cryptographic hash, and if the hash was "deadbeef," the URL would be "/d/de/deadbeef.jpg." However, many users encountered issues with images not displaying randomly. It was discovered that this problem occurred because a lot of people were running add-ons that blocked "/a/ad/". To avoid running afoul of various censorware filters, it should be a design target. This may seem insane, but it is crucial because troubleshooting a situation where "The key is 'Tienanmen Square people monkey'" and "People monkey isn't working!" can be challenging.</p>
