    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on 10/09/13 at 23:03, Matthew Mitchell suggested that the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) would have been better without aggressive words. Pavol Rusnak, who sent the original email, responded by encouraging Mitchell to come up with wordlist enhancements, as the purpose of the BIP was to be discussed and improved upon. Rusnak explained that despite three people going through the wordlist multiple times, it still wasn't perfect. He also warned that for every word removed from the list, a good alternative must be provided that is unique and difficult to confuse with others.</p>
