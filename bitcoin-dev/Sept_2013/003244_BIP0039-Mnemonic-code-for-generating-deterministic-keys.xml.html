    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from September 2013, Matthew Mitchell expressed concern about the potential offensiveness of certain words in a project. He suggested that it would have been better to avoid "aggressive words" like "murder black people," "stupid asian person," or "whip african slave." In response, someone suggested using mechanical turk time to rate the 2048 words for potential offensiveness and threatening language. The suggestion was made to use nouns as they often make for fairly neutral words, but warned to be careful when using place names with political complications such as Gdansk vs Danzig.</p>
