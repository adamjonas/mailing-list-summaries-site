    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A possible solution for watermarking images on social media platforms has been suggested. This would involve creating a mobile app that gets API access to read/write the user's profile picture, allowing it to periodically check if the image has changed, and rewatermark and reupload the highest resolution available. However, this manual process may not be suitable for everyone and may result in the user losing comments or likes on their primary photo or ending up with duplicates.While it is unclear whether an app can edit a photo after it was uploaded or only create new ones, reading the user's watermarked address requires no API access or account. It is recommended to encode a short URL containing a payment request rather than using an actual Bitcoin address or key, as social network photos have low stegod data capacity due to compression. Users would need to rotate their key from time to time at the hosting site.</p>
