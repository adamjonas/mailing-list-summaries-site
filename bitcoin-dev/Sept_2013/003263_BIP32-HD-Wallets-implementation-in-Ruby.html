    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Micah Winkelspecht has developed an open source Ruby gem library, called MoneyTree, that implements Hierarchical Deterministic Bitcoin wallets (BIP32). The library passes all of the test vectors and has 100% code coverage. He has also written a detailed README which goes into depth about HD Wallets, which he plans to turn into a blog post. However, as he is new to crypto, he wants to run it by someone who has knowledge of BIP32 to review it before releasing it to the public. Micah invites anyone with knowledge of the BIP32 spec to check out the repo on GitHub and give feedback. He also welcomes anyone with conceptual accuracy knowledge to read over his README.</p>
