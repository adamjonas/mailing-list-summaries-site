On September 4, 2013, Randolph D. forwarded an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding the release of Secure Instant Messenger version 04 through SourceForge. However, someone responded asking them not to post such topics on Bitcoin-development as it was off-topic and they had already been asked to stop in the past. The email also included a link for subscribing to LearnDevNow that provided over 1,500 hours of step-by-step tutorial videos for mastering Microsoft technologies.
