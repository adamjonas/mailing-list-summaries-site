    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The developers of a cryptocurrency wallet are open to changes in their wordlist and will accept pull requests replacing potentially offensive words with more neutral ones that fit all other requirements. The process of putting the wordlist together was reportedly a challenging task that required several sleepless nights. Despite concerns raised by one individual about the inclusion of words like "murder, black, people" in the wordlist, these words were also found in another widely-used wordlist without any complaints. A suggestion was made to use mechanical turk time to rate the words for potential offensiveness and threatening, with nouns often making for fairly neutral words.</p>
