        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Trsst project aims to enable content monetization through micro payments of digital crypto-currency. Each user account on the platform is a digital wallet, and authors can receive payments each time their content is consumed, shared or liked. Wendell suggests watermarking addresses into social network profile pictures to link them to personal profiles, which would allow users to send Bitcoin to any Facebook user who has configured their profile correctly. A library that implements watermarking that can survive social network recompression exists, but it is written in Java.Mike Hearn proposed watermarking images with Bitcoin addresses to connect social networking profiles without the need for API access. Blockchain.info offers sending 'coin via Facebook, and Bitcoins With Friends is another option, but most other apps have vanished due to Facebook's lack of friendliness towards them. However, the thread is open for discussion on other ideas to make Bitcoin easier to use. The advantage of watermarking is that every social network supports profile pictures, and Facebook and Twitter allow querying of users' pictures without needing API or authentication.A possible solution for watermarking images on social media platforms has been suggested. This would involve creating a mobile app that gets API access to read/write the user's profile picture, allowing it to periodically check if the image has changed, and rewatermark and reupload the highest resolution available. However, this manual process may not be suitable for everyone and may result in the user losing comments or likes on their primary photo or ending up with duplicates. While it is unclear whether an app can edit a photo after it was uploaded or only create new ones, reading the user's watermarked address requires no API access or account. It is recommended to encode a short URL containing a payment request rather than using an actual Bitcoin address or key, as social network photos have low stegod data capacity due to compression. Users would need to rotate their key from time to time at the hosting site. Overall, the proposals aim to make Bitcoin easier to use and enable content monetization through micro payments of digital crypto-currency. While most apps have vanished due to Facebook's lack of support for them, Blockchain.info offers sending 'coin via Facebook and Bitcoins With Friends is also available. The library that implements watermarking that can survive social network recompression exists, but it is written in Java.</p>
