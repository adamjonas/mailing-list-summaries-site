    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Passengers are requested to return to their seats and fasten their seat-belts as all Bitcoin-qt / Bitcoind nodes are currently facing a problem. After restarting, the nodes report "coin database inconsistencies found" and prompt users with "Do you want to rebuild the block database now?" Reindexing will not solve this issue. The problem appears to have been introduced by 0.8.0 and is only local, causing annoyance in restarting nodes but is harmless and carries no forking risk. However, it will require a software update to be fixed completely. To work around this problem, users should specify the command-line or configuration file argument -checklevel=2 to Bitcoind or Bitcoin-qt. This issue will persist until no more than 288 blocks after 256818, unless another trigger transaction is added to the blockchain. A patch will be made available soon, and more information will be released at that time.</p>
