    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.5 has been released and is available for download from sourceforge. This version includes a critical bug fix that affects all users, thus upgrading is strongly recommended. The bug affected transactions with version numbers larger than 0x7fffffff which were being relayed and included in blocks incorrectly. Furthermore, it caused the code that checks for LevelDB database inconsistencies at startup to erroneously report database corruption and suggest reindexing of the database. Additionally, this release includes a non-critical fix to the code that enforces BIP 34 (block height in the coinbase transaction). If any bugs are found, users are encouraged to report them using the issue tracker on github. Special thanks go to Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille for quickly identifying and fixing the transaction version number bug.</p>
