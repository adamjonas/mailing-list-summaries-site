    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin protocol and code have policy decision points that may pose as centralized risks or choke points, which could undermine the peer-to-peer (p2p) nature. It has been suggested to find a technical solution for these issues such as advanced cryptography and byzantine networking argument. Nonetheless, it appears that bitcoin-dev would rather focus on something that has reached the stage of having a BIP. Early-stage speculative ideas can be discussed on bitcointalk.org's technical thread. Regarding taxation, there are cases where even the political sphere accepts significantly anonymous taxation. For example, Europeans with certain types of investment in a Swiss bank can receive their money as a single payment across all users per European country to their passport home country, minus a 25% cut for the Swiss government. Such similar possibilities could exist for Bitcoin, and the discussion on this topic should take place on a relevant forum. Finally, it was emphasized to keep the mailing list for technical discussions related to writing code.</p>
