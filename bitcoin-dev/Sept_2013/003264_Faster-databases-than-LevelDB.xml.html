    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library, which performs exceptionally well if it gets enough CPU time and disk seeks, but it is not the final word in performance. HyperLevelDB is a fork of LevelDB with changes to the locking mechanism and compaction process. However, one downside of HyperLevelDB is that write throttling is removed when compaction falls behind, and the application is expected to manage it. Sophia is another competitor to LevelDB, and according to their website, Sophia outperforms LevelDB in benchmarks. Sophia claims to have an edge over LevelDB with its C-based programming and BSD licensing. Sophia also claims to be capable of 438,084 random reads/sec on SSD-based machines compared to 167,476 random reads/sec of LevelDB. This capability is critical because it's what UTXO lookups involve. In comparison to HyperLevelDB, Sophia appears to have a more significant difference in performance, whereas HyperLevelDB can do random writes faster than Sophia.</p>
