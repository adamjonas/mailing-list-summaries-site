    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the idea of having a voting system for features using Bitcoin. The idea involves users voting with their wallets by sending funds to a corresponding address for the feature they want to see implemented. The conversation also touches on the concept of assurance contracts and how they could be used to fund a complex project. However, it is acknowledged that implementing this idea would require significant software development. The conversation then shifts to the potential burden on users if the Bitcoin network were to start relaying blocks. It is pointed out that mobile and tablet devices have different capabilities and limitations compared to desktop computers and laptops. Running Bitcoin software in the background on these devices could result in a negative impact on battery life and bandwidth usage. Nevertheless, it is suggested that enthusiasts may use a separate device, such as a Raspberry Pi, to donate to the network without affecting their primary device's performance.</p>
