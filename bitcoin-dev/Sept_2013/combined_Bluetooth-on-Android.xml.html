        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a hackfest in Berlin, Andreas and the author of an article prototyped Bluetooth transaction submission on Android over a year ago. The feature will soon be available with support on-by-default for the sending side, allowing anyone to enable it in the settings page and start receiving payments via Bluetooth as long as both sides use the Bitcoin Wallet app. The current protocol used is proprietary, but once the payment protocol is implemented in bitcoinj, the authors plan to recast the Bluetooth support to use that and submit a BIP for it. Sending transactions via Bluetooth resolves one of the most common UX fails seen in Europe where people cannot reasonably spend their Bitcoins while abroad because data roaming is expensive. By allowing the receiver, i.e., the merchant, to receive the transaction via Bluetooth, this problem is avoided. Additionally, the receiver can broadcast the transaction on the user's behalf if they are local. The authors use an unauthenticated RFCOMM socket with the adapter MAC address in a new btcmac parameter in the bitcoin:URI QR code. No pairing is required, but MITM attacks on the connection are possible. However, all that's done with it is writing raw tx bytes out over the connection, so MITM is limited to DoS.</p>
