    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, user wendell expressed confusion about the development of a payment protocol, believing it to be primarily for merchants. Some comments in the thread suggested that there were complex steps involved which may be difficult for non-technical end users, such as obtaining a certificate from a Certificate Authority. In response, user Mike Hearn explained that the payment protocol was designed to simplify transactions and identity verification between parties. The sender would submit a payment containing their own identity details, while the recipient would vend a PaymentRequest containing theirs. With this information, a wallet would be able to understand how to complete the transaction.</p>
