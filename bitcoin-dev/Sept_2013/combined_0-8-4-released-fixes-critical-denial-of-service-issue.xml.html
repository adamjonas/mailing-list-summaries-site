        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.4 has been released, and users are urged to upgrade to take advantage of the maintenance update which addresses a critical bug and three security issues. One of the security issues resolved in this release relates to Bloom filters, which were introduced with version 0.8; an attacker could send messages that resulted in an integer division-by-zero error in the Bloom Filter handling code, causing the Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind process to crash. Another issue resolved was a denial-of-service attack vulnerability related to RPC password guess attempts. Additionally, a better fix has been implemented for the fill-memory-with-orphan-transactions attack that was fixed in 0.8.3.Several bugs have also been addressed in this release, including fixing multi-block reorg transaction resurrection and non-standard disconnected transactions causing mempool orphans. Furthermore, there are some changes made specifically for Linux and OSX users, such as the use of 'FD_FULLSYNC' with LevelDB on OSX to prevent database corruption issues. The release includes a checkpoint at block 250,000 to help speed up initial block downloads and improve accuracy of the progress indicator when downloading. All bugs can be reported using the issue tracker at Github.</p>
