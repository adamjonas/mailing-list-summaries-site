    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This context provides bounties for demonstrating collision attacks against various cryptographic algorithms, particularly SHA1. To collect the bounty, one must demonstrate two messages that are not equal in value but result in the same digest when hashed. These messages will be used in a scriptSig, which will satisfy the scriptPubKey storing the bountied funds, allowing the collector to move them to a scriptPubKey of their choice. Further donations to the bounties are welcome. The context also includes details about decodescript command for different algorithms like SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160, and more. It also provides notes and limitations for collecting bounties, including the advice to mine the block in which you collect your bounty yourself as scriptSigs do not cryptographically sign the transaction's outputs.</p>
