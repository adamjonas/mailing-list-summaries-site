        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of this message has raised a question about the location of the three databases in Bitcoin, including network addresses, block chain, and wallet. They suggest that it would be more convenient to have them separated into different paths for easier backup and transportation. The block chain database is noted as being the most important and time-consuming to duplicate and transport. The author questions whether it is possible to back up by only copying files with equal or newer dates, as well as log, current, and manifest files, and suggests initial and incremental backups. These concerns are due to worries about data frailties on operating systems like Windows and the importance of knowing where one's data is located. In summary, the author is suggesting that separating the three databases in Bitcoin into separate paths would make backup and transportation easier. They have also questioned the possibility of backing up files with equal or newer dates and suggested initial and incremental backups due to concerns about data frailties on operating systems like Windows.</p>
