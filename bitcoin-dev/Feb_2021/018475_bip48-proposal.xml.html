    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a new BIP, called bip48, has been put forward to document modern multi-sig derivations. The explicit purpose of this BIP is to define an already existing standard that is used in practice across multi-sig wallets. However, some key points have been brought up, such as not defining a `script_type` as a path level and including a defined "wild card" in the script_type level to define any future address types. The proposed BIP has removed all references to legacy p2sh derivations and kept strictly to p2sh-p2wsh and p2wsh derivations as used in modern day wallets. A PR has been created so that anyone may easily comment on it and any concerns can be raised. The community needs this and it is well overdue. The proposal has garnered positive feedback and support from other developers.</p>
