    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Antoine and Pieter discuss the potential privacy implications of a change that would ease the discovery of a node's tx-relay topology. Antoine suggests that if an unrequested-tx peer is sending an attack, it likely learned the transaction from somewhere else, such as the tx owner. He also notes that the same outcome can already be achieved by sending an INV and observing if a GETDATA is replied back to guess the presence of another peer with already the knowledge of the txid or connecting to this other peer and waiting for an announcement.However, Pieter expresses concern about the privacy implications of the change and asks for clarification on why it is not a concern. Antoine agrees that the transaction announcements/requests logic is worthy of more study about its privacy properties, particularly with recent changes and upcoming Erlay changes. Despite this concern, Antoine does not see how the proposed change would ease attackers' work compared to already-existing heuristics.</p>
