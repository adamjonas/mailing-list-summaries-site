    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH sent an email expressing concerns about Taproot. He stated that the reported features of Taproot including the ability to hide transactions like Monero could harm Bitcoin's honesty and fairness, leading governments to ban it. However, @JeremyRubin replied stating that Taproot does not enable Monero-like privacy features any more than already exist in Bitcoin today. It is simply a way to make transactions with embedded smart contracts less expensive. Jeremy further explained that "monero-like" transaction graph obfuscation may already exist in Bitcoin via other techniques (coinjoin, payjoin, coinswap, lightning, etc) with or without Taproot. In addition, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH expressed his support for the expanded use case of Bitcoin without harming its core functionality, values, and equal equity offered. The email also contained information about Willtech, go-overt.com, and other projects by Damian A. James Williamson. The email ended with a disclaimer that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.</p>
