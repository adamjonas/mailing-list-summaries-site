    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a communication from February 18, 2021, Matt commented on the potential for different implementations to have varying consensus rules and the risk of Bitcoin falling out of consensus. However, the author of the post believes that educating users about the trade-offs involved in both options with charts and tables would be more useful than stopping the activation of Taproot altogether. They suggest using Bitcoin Knots for more projects and maintaining multiple forks of Bitcoin Core for better decentralization. Despite Bitcoin Core being used by most nodes according to a pie chart, having multiple forks with real usage, more maintainers, different features, better communication channels, etc., could benefit everyone involved in Bitcoin. The author is currently working on a project involving multisig, discreet log contracts, liquid, etc., and using bitcoin-s for it but plans to try Bitcoin Knots and other implementations soon. They are also looking for developers in India who are interested in maintaining a fork of Bitcoin Core with a few changes.</p>
