    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Keagan McClelland discussed the implementation of IBD (initial block download) in Bitcoin nodes. He proposed that once the node's IBD is complete, it would advertise this as a peer service, advertising its seed and threshold so that nodes could deterministically deduce which of its peers had which blocks. However, this idea was previously discussed in the context of BIP159, which warned about the potential fingerprinting weakness. The idea was also deemed unlikely to be adopted by popular node software unless it solves an urgent problem. Luke Dashjr's rough data collection currently shows 5,629 archival listening nodes, which is a substantial fraction of the roughly 10,000 listening nodes reported. Node developers would find a reasonable solution to the fingerprinting problem very interesting.</p>
