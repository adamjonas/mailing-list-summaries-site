    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 16th, a second meeting on Taproot activation was held on IRC which was open to all. The arguments for LOT (lockinontimeout) should be set to true or false were explored in depth in the meeting. The conversation log and a summary of the meeting were provided by Luke Dashjr on Mastodon. The activation height range proposed is 693504-745920 and MASF threshold is 1815/2016 blocks (90%). However, only ~100 people showed up for the meetings, hardly representative of the entire community. There wasn't overwhelming consensus for either LOT=true or LOT=false. There was clearly more strong opposition against LOT=true than there was for LOT=false among Bitcoin Core contributors, Lightning developers, and other community members. In addition, some mining pools expressed a preference for lot=false. If they are to attempt to finalize Taproot activation parameters and propose them to the community at this time, their only option is to propose LOT=false. Delay appears counterproductive in their collective aim to get the Taproot soft fork activated as early as possible.A code review of the Bitcoin Core PR #19573, which was initially delayed because of this LOT discussion, is planned for Tuesday February 23rd at 19:00 UTC on the IRC channel ##taproot-activation.</p>
