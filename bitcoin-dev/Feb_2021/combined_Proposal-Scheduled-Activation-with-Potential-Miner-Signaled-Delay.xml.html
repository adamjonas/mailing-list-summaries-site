        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal for a new activation procedure for consensus rules has been put forward, which uses BIP8's optional "Lock on Timeout" feature. This approach allows miners to delay the activation of new consensus rules until any technological or validation issues have been resolved. The proposal specifies an alternative to BIP8, where activation may be delayed a limited number of times or postponed entirely. The proposal aims to help miners implement the technological aspects of this network upgrade and allows them to signal their lack of readiness, triggering a delay or postponement. After a pre-starting period of 6 months, if the vast majority of miners have successfully upgraded, the first 2016 block period will lock-in the upgrade without any delay. The proposal addresses the issue of confusion between signaling readiness of the miner software and signaling political support of the consensus change by requiring miners to explicitly signal that they are "not ready" for the proposed network upgrade. The upgrade becomes activated if less than 126 blocks signal "not ready" in any interval or if 126 or more blocks signal "not ready", but less than 1008 blocks signal "not ready" for a total of 14 intervals. The upgrade fails if 1008 or more blocks signal "not ready", and 126 or more blocks signal "not ready" in all remaining intervals.</p>
