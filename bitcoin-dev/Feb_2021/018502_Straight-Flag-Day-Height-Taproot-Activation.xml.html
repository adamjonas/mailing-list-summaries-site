    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion around the activation of Taproot has brought up several points, including the potential for miners to generate invalid blocks through SPV mining. As a result, there is concern that "bad block enhanced selfish mining" could be profitable, with some miners taking advantage of this loophole. While it may be difficult to analyze exactly what this would look like, one scenario involves 25% of hashrate mining bad blocks, resulting in an overall benefit of more than 5%. However, accommodating un-upgraded miners could lead to oscillating hashrate being optimal.There is also debate about mandatory signaling and how it differs from a flag day. Matt Corallo notes that mandatory signaling blatantly ignores goal (3) from his original post and results in any miner who has not taken active action generating invalid blocks. Other points of contention include the release of a flag day without LOT=true code and the value of early activation. Some argue that a fixed activation date may be superior for business purposes and software engineering schedules. There is also concern about the time frame for secondary review processes if BIP-8 activates immediately.Despite these concerns, there is agreement that all the contention around LOT makes a flag day look less problematic. It is suggested that something closer to a flag day might not be so bad for future forks as well. However, given the appetite for early activation, some believe that LOT=true is the best option at this time as it allows for compatibility with such an early activation. Overall, the debate continues regarding the best course of action for Taproot activation.</p>
