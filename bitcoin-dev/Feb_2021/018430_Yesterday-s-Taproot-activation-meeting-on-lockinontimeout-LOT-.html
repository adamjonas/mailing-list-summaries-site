    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The activation of Taproot has been a topic of discussion among the Bitcoin community. The debate has centered around whether the LockinOnTimeout (LOT) should be set to true or false. During a recent meeting, there was no clear consensus for either LOT=true or LOT=false. However, there appeared to be more opposition against LOT=true than there was for LOT=false. Several pools expressed preference for LOT=false. As a result, it is recommended that LOT=false be proposed in protocol implementations.However, activating a mechanism like this can be contentious and must be resolved carefully to ensure agreement among community members. To avoid forcing a decision upon users, one possible solution suggested is to release a version requiring taprootlot=1 or taprootlot=0 without mandating either LOT=true or LOT=false. This approach would allow users to make their own decisions about which option to choose.According to developer Michael Folkson, prompt action is needed to activate the Taproot soft fork successfully. Any further delays could be counterproductive towards achieving this goal. Although some may disagree with his assessment, Michael plans to avoid further discussions unless new information arises or individuals change their minds.A code review of Bitcoin Core PR #19573 is planned for Tuesday, February 23rd at 19:00 UTC on the IRC channel ##taproot-activation. The review will follow the format of the Bitcoin Core PR review club and will be more technical and lower level. Michael thanked the meeting participants for engaging in productive and good faith discussions during the meeting and provided his contact details if anyone wishes to connect with him.</p>
