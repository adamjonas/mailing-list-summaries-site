    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, expressed his concern about the potential risks of implementing a UASF-style command line option to allow consensus rule changes in the node before a fork. He stated that such an option poses a risk of a fork, even if it may not persist over months. Additionally, he expressed his reservation regarding the safety of "-set-bip8-lockinontimeout=taproot" option and did not see any good ideas on how to make it safe. Corallo emphasized that a config param / command line option is not a good idea for bip8. He also agreed that there is a material technical complexity hiding behind a “change the consensus rules“ option. Therefore, putting resources into fixing these issues may not be worth it. Lastly, Corallo discussed "preferentially peer with other UASF nodes" PR for the BIP148 client and its list discussion. He added that he would try playing around with it and reorgs on a signet to see how it goes in cases other than ones that are unlikely to happen in practice.</p>
