    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate on whether to activate Taproot with LOT (LockinOnTimeout) set to true or false has been ongoing. The arguments against setting it to false are highlighted in F1-F7. While the probability of Taproot not being activated by miners is small, it is not desirable to create such a risk forcing the community to place extra trust in miners. Furthermore, if miners fail to activate Taproot despite pledging support and there being overwhelming community consensus for it, it would set a precedent that miners cannot be relied upon at all to activate soft forks.The worst-case scenario is having to wait over a year for Taproot to be activated, but redeployment could create a situation where users believe they have already upgraded for Taproot but do not enforce it due to not understanding the need to upgrade yet again. Setting LOT=false with a threat to change it to true later is antagonistic against miners. With LOT=true, expectations are simply made clear and miners can cooperate by making valid blocks as they do day-to-day already.BIP 8 makes it explicitly easy for people to reject the soft fork if they don't like it, so any claim of being "forced" is a non-starter to an honest person. Any deployment, or even status quo, can be falsely portrayed/spun in a way to harm Bitcoin. As such, only objective criteria should be considered.Even if developers release software, it must still be accepted by the community in the form of actively choosing to run the software which includes the activation. So long as the activation is clearly and prominently documented, users have taken the action to accept the protocol change. Furthermore, the community has already demonstrated a clear and undisputed support for the activation of Taproot. If there was/is any question of whether that is true or not, it is premature to be planning activation of ANY type.</p>
