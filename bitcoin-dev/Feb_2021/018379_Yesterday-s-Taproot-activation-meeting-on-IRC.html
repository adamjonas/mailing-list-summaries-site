    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 2nd, an open meeting was held on IRC to discuss Taproot activation. The meeting was previously announced on a Linux Foundation mailing list. The conversation log is available online for those interested in the discussion. Rusty Russell provided his takeaways from the meeting which included unanimous support for BIP 8 and overwhelming consensus that one year is the correct timeout value. There was also majority consensus for lockinontimeout false, though some individuals, including Luke Dashjr, opposed it. No decision was made on start time. Two BIP 8 PRs were merged following the meeting due to an observation from Jonas Nick that without them nodes could end up on the wrong chain. Bitcoin Core PR #19573 requires further review before it can be considered for merging. A follow-up meeting will be organized in the format of John Newberyâ€™s Bitcoin Core PR review club. Chun Wang, co-founder of F2Pool with approximately 16% of global hash rate, has decided to support BIP 8 (false, 1 year) according to an update on taprootactivation.com provided by Alejandro De La Torre.</p>
