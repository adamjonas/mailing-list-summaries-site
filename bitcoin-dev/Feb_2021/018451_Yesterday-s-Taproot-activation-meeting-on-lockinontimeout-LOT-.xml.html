    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of a mailing list recently suggested that Bitcoin Core add a LOT=true option to facilitate the Taproot activation process. The suggestion was made in response to ongoing debate about the manner of Taproot's activation, rather than whether or not it should be activated. The proposed option would give power to both miners and users and incentivize them to signal activation as quickly as possible, with neither group expressing disapproval of activation. This approach would position developers as neutral facilitators and could lead to an increase in the popularity of running a full node. Miners would also be incentivized to expedite Taproot activation to avoid being perceived as the "bad guys" and to prevent the spread of full nodes. If miners do not activate, users can organize a UASF in a grass-roots way.</p>
