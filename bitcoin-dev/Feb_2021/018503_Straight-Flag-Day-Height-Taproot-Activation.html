    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of SPV mining generating invalid blocks has been discussed recently, with concerns about the potential profitability of "bad block enhanced selfish mining." However, it was pointed out that someone would have to take malicious action to mine a bad block, whereas with forced signaling, all it takes is one unconfigured pool server to generate invalid blocks. The discussion also touched on the topic of mandatory signaling versus a flag day for Taproot activation, with some arguing that a flag day would be simpler and more universally understood, while others believed BIP-8 was partially in service of early activation and could be superior for business purposes and software engineering schedules. Some also noted that releasing a flag day without LOT=true code would make clients incompatible with early activation proposals, and that there were pros and cons to activating rules at a fixed date versus via signaling. Ultimately, the discussions highlighted the complexity of implementing changes to the Bitcoin network and the need for careful consideration and planning.</p>
