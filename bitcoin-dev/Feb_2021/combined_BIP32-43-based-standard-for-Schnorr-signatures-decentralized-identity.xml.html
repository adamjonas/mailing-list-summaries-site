        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin Core IRC, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky and Peter Wuille discussed key derivations, security, key tweaks in the context of Schnorr signatures & Taproot. Pieter Wuille clarified two key issues: avoiding reuse of keys for privacy reasons and avoiding using related keys for cryptographic reasons. He emphasized that distinct standard derivation paths help with key reuse in simple cases, but theyâ€™re not a full solution in the most general case. For cryptographic reasons, there are no known attacks against usage of related keys across ECDSA and Schnorr, but it's advisable to make sure ECDSA key and Schnorr keys use distinct hardened derivation steps. If the keys are not separated by a hardened step, it's more complicated. Pieter Wuille added that dedicated branches only help for the simple case. For example, it doesn't address the more general problem of preventing reuse of keys in multiple distinct groups of multisig sets you participate in. If you want to solve that, you need to keep track of what index is for participating in what - and once you have something like that you don't need dedicated purpose-based derivation at all anymore. He also mentioned that non-reuse across ECDSA and BIP340 keys is important because, if someone were to do all of these wrong and sign the same message with both, you would leak your private key. This isn't a concern for Bitcoin transaction signing, as the sighash indirectly commits to BIP341 or not, making it impossible to construct colliding messages.</p>
