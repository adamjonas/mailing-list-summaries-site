    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 16th, a meeting was held on IRC to discuss Taproot activation. The meeting was a follow-up to the previous meeting, which had shown majority support for LOT=false over LOT=true. The arguments for both sides were outlined in their strongest form in a mailing list post and an additional argument for LOT=false was provided by David Harding. The conversation log and a video of the meeting are available online. Luke Dashjr provided a summary of the meeting on Mastodon. There was no overwhelming consensus for either LOT=true or LOT=false, but there was more strong opposition against LOT=true than there was for LOT=false. Some Bitcoin Core contributors and Lightning developers who did not attend the meeting in person are also opposed to LOT=true. It is currently assessed that if Taproot activation parameters are to be proposed to the community at this time, the only option is to propose LOT=false. A code review of the Bitcoin Core PR #19573 is planned for Tuesday February 23rd at 19:00 UTC on the IRC channel ##taproot-activation.</p>
