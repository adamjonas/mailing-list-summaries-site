    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Christopher Allen and Hugo, they discuss the use of XPUBs in multisig wallets. They agree that reusing XPUBs inside different multisig wallets is not a good idea since loss of privacy in one wallet will immediately affect the privacy of other wallets. Instead, they suggest using one unique XPUB per wallet to completely firewall them from each other. The Airgapped Wallet Community has also been looking into a multi-round commitment scheme to align the UX with musig for users. While nothing got as far as their version, Blockchain Commons gave a concept ACK and will review the specifics. They mention that they are releasing a descriptor and multisig centric iOS and Android reference wallet soon, so solving this correctly and having interoperability with others is crucial for their roadmap.</p>
