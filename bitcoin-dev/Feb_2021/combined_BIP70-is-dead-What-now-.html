        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Andrew Kozlik has developed an experimental implementation of a new payment request format in Trezor T, which seeks to address the issue of signed payment requests in exchanges. The format is similar to BIP-70 but without reliance on X.509. The new format offers protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and can be used to solve a problem with coin exchange. It uses an optional nonce for replay protection and requires a mandatory signature.Charles Hill has also developed a URL signing scheme for use with LNURL as a method for authorizing payments on behalf of offline devices or applications. The scheme generates an API key to be shared between a server and an offline device or application.Thomas Voegtlin, the founder of Electrum, expressed his dislike of BIP70 due to its complexity and unclear main features, but he finds the feature of signed payment requests useful, especially when sending Bitcoin to an exchange. He suggested that a standard for signed requests should be adopted, allowing users to receive a signed request from an exchange, providing proof that the exchange asked them to send coins to a particular address.The proposed new payment request format and URL signing scheme are expected to improve security and trust within the Bitcoin ecosystem. If implemented by an exchange, the feature of signed payment requests would guide users' decisions on which exchange to use. This would provide better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and offer optional replay protection with a mandatory signature requirement.</p>
