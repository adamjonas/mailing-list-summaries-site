        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin's non-overlapping difficulty calculation has been vulnerable to gaming since 2012 due to inaccurate timestamps. This vulnerability can be fixed with a soft-fork that further constrains block timestamps, and several proposals have been suggested. A demonstration of timewarp was put early in the testnet3 chain for people to test mitigations against it. The risk of deploying these mitigations would be minimal and several proposals are fully compatible with existing behavior and only trigger in exceptional circumstances. However, a majority hashrate is required to fix this vulnerability which could be easily blocked if someone started using it. In August 2018, Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list about an issue with Bitcoin's non-overlapping difficulty calculation that had been known since 2012. He explained that it was vulnerable to gaming with inaccurate timestamps to increase the rate of block production beyond the system's intentional design. While there had been proposals for fixing this vulnerability with a soft-fork, none were backwards compatible. One proposal being discussed is to require the timestamp of block (2016x) not smaller than its parent block by t-seconds, with 0 ≤ t ≤ infinity. With t=86400 (one day), a timewrap attacker may bring down the difficulty by about 1/14 = 7.1% per round. Despite this vulnerability, there hasn't been a big priority into fixing it because it requires a majority hashrate and could easily be blocked if someone started using it.In order to test mitigations against this issue, a demonstration of timewarp was put early in the testnet3 chain, pegging the difficulty way down and churning out blocks at the maximum rate allowed by the median time protocol rule. In light of this, the author thinks it would be useful to ask the list if anyone else is aware of a favorite backwards compatible timewarp fix proposal they want to point out.The problem arises from the difference between the timestamps at the end of a period and the block right after it. Soft forking to force those to be 'close enough' together sounds like a solid approach. Let's say three hours backward jump plus some safety parameter. It also feels like a good idea to not allow a jump of more than three hours forwards either, just on principle. That should result in minimal code changes, and rarely any orphaning of non-upgraded miners at all, and still only 1/2016 blocks when they do. This solution suffers from still allowing the attack a little bit, but three hours out of every two weeks seems like no big deal.A chain-split would happen even without any attack if a naive fix is adopted, which requires every block (2016x) to have a timestamp not smaller than that of its parent block. This fix involves mandatory upgrade of pool software and will cause a chain split unless super-majority of miners are enforcing the new rules. The best way is to do it with something like BIP34, which also requires new pool software. The difficulty calculation for timestamps on the blockchain could be restricted to prevent attacks such as powLimit and "unlimited" blocks in less than four weeks of > 50% selfish mining. This would require a change in how timestamps are used, but it is unclear if this change would be backward compatible. LTC, BCH, and LTC have all experienced similar attacks in the past, but this solution may prevent future ones. Other solutions may not be effective against these types of attacks.</p>
