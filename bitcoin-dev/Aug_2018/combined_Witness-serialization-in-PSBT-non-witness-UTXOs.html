        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille has proposed an update to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 specification regarding non-witness unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). Currently, the specification requires these transactions to be serialized in network format. However, Wuille argues that this approach is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, he states that the inclusion of witness data, even if present in the spent transaction, is irrelevant to PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transactions). Secondly, the term "network format" is ambiguous and could lead to compatibility issues in the future.To address these concerns, Wuille suggests updating the specification to require non-witness UTXOs to be serialized without the witness. If this is not feasible, he proposes explicitly stating whether the witness is required or not. Another developer, Andrew Chow, supports Wuille's proposal and adds that specifying non-witness UTXOs as "witness or non-witness" serialization would ensure backward and forward compatibility.The group involved in the discussion agrees that clarifying the specification is crucial for maintaining compatibility with existing signers and ensuring forward compatibility. They believe that the inclusion of witness data in non-witness UTXOs is unnecessary for PSBT and that the term "network format" should be clarified to avoid potential compatibility issues in the future.Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer and contributor to BIP174, has raised concerns about the current specification for non-witness UTXOs. He argues that including witness data is irrelevant to PSBT and that the term "network format" is ambiguous. He proposes updating the specification to serialize non-witness UTXOs without the witness or explicitly specifying whether the witness is required. The group agrees that clarifying the specification is necessary for compatibility and seeks opinions on the matter.</p>
