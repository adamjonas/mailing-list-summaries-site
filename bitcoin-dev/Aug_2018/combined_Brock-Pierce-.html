        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 17, 2018, Peter Todd posted a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. However, this message was not PGP signed and originated from a different server than usual. Todd suspects that the SPF filtering on the list mail server was not functioning properly. For privacy reasons, the PGP signed message within the post is not included, but Todd can be contacted at 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.The text provided appears to be an encrypted message in PGP format, utilizing public key cryptography. Without the corresponding private key, it is impossible to decrypt the message or determine its contents. The encrypted message consists of a seemingly random string of characters and symbols, which is typical for encrypted messages.A commenter expresses their opinion about the viability of EOS as a solution for censorship resistance. They argue against the effectiveness of EOS and state their belief that anything supported by Brock Pierce is destined to fail. However, the specific actions or statements by Brock that led to this claim are not mentioned. Despite this, the commenter suggests that Brock's involvement with any project should be viewed skeptically.In summary, the comment raises concerns regarding the suitability of EOS for censorship resistance. The author questions the effectiveness of EOS and criticizes Brock Pierce, referring to him as a "pedo" and suggesting that his support guarantees failure. The exact reasons for these criticisms towards Brock remain unclear, but the comment does shed light on potential issues with both EOS and its supporters.</p>
