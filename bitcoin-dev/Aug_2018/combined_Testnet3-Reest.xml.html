        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made for a signed blocks testnet with predictable structured reorg pattern, as an alternative to the current mined testnet which is too stable when you want it to be unstable and too wildly unstable when you want a bit of stability. This would be a useful middle ground between regtest, which never sees anything remotely surprising and can't easily be used for collaborative testing, and full on testnet where your attempts to test against ordinary noise require you cope your entirely universe being removed from existence and replaced by something almost but not quite entirely different at the whim of some cthulhuian blind idiot god. There have been previous efforts to implement this in Bitcoin core, but it increased the size of the blockindex objects in memory while not in signed testnet mode. Another suggestion was to have two testnets at the same time, with one having a smaller block size. However, Peter Todd suggested that a larger blockchain than mainnet would be better to find size-related issues first. He also recommended using regtest for testing, which allows private regtest blockchains to be set up fairly easily and with good control over exactly when and how blocks are created.Meanwhile, there have been concerns about the growing size of the current testnet, which is now 1411795 blocks and takes at least 48 hours for a full sync. Some have suggested a testnet reset should be scheduled in the next release to reduce disk overheads and facilitate fast onboarding for testing purposes.</p>
