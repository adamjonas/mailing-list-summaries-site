    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread between Aymeric Vitte and Marcel Jamin discusses the issue of online services that ask for private keys and seeds to offer "free" coins. Jamin suggests that users should almost never publish a service that asks for private keys as the server might get compromised, and moving coins by oneself isn't even correct if the server is involved. Vitte responds with a warning that people can't refrain from putting their keys to get "free" coins and mentions his web interface tool for bitcoin-transactions, which allows users to move their coins without fees. He acknowledges that it is not advised to use private keys currently, but an offline tool would be ideal if there is some incentive to do so. The tool is supposedly the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses, decodes redeem scripts, and creates transactions on its own. The issue of invalid bech32 addresses from Electrum wallets after segwit is also mentioned. Overall, Vitte believes that a safe and secure tool would be a welcome step in the right direction for mainstream bitcoin users who value efficiency and simplicity.</p>
