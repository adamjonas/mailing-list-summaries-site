    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named shiva sitamraju asked whether there is a scheduled reset for testnet in the next release due to it being 1411795 blocks long and taking at least 48 hours for a full sync. However, Peter Todd disagreed with this suggestion and instead advocated for testnet to be a larger blockchain than mainnet in order to find size-related issues first. He also suggested that regtest may be a better alternative for testing, as private regtest blockchains can be easily set up with good control over when and how blocks are created. Additionally, there was a proposal for having two testnets at the same time, with one having a smaller block size to make it easier and faster for testing purposes. Despite this proposal, the idea of a larger testnet was favored by Peter Todd. Overall, it seems that a public testnet remains useful for making references to transactions in articles, but various alternatives exist for testing purposes, including regtest and private blockchains.</p>
