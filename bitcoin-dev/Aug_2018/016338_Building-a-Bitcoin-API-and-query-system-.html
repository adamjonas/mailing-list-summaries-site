    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jonas Schnelli requested for concrete use-cases for a block explorer API. Ayms provided an example of such an API in <a href="https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions,">https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions,</a> which is similar to bitcoin-cli but without a wallet. However, this API is difficult to use and not widely adopted. As a solution, Ayms created <a href="https://peersm.com/wallet,">https://peersm.com/wallet,</a> which queries information outside and provides the right command to use with the tool or outputs the transaction if users input their keys. Although there are plans to put the app in advanced mode as an offline one inside browsers, there remains the problem of connecting to APIs/explorers like the one suggested to enter the keys during the query phase, which is not very secure. A decentralized solution is envisioned to address this issue. Ayms provided links to other projects such as Zcash wallets, Bitcoin wallets, dynamic blocklists, and anti-spies and private torrents on GitHub.</p>
