    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the issue of online services that asks for private keys and seeds, which poses a threat to user security if servers get compromised. The idea behind "Move your coins by yourself" is to avoid getting trapped by wallets or things that users don't have control over. An online tool called <a href="https://peersm.com/wallet">https://peersm.com/wallet</a> has been created to provide an alternative, with private keys being optional and the tool outputting the command to use with bitcoin-transactions. Additionally, it allows users to create transactions on their own and is the only online tool that converts bech32 addresses and decodes redeem scripts from any address. However, it is not advised to use private keys until it becomes an offline tool. Some users report invalid bech32 addresses from their Electrum wallet, which causes confusion after segwit. Several GitHub projects are also linked in the context.</p>
