    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Aymeric Vitte suggests a bitcoin transaction app outside of Bitcoin Core and without a wallet, called bitcoin-transactions. However, few succeed in using it. To solve this problem, peersm.com/wallet queries the info outside and outputs the right command for users to use with the tool. It also outputs the transaction if people input their keys. Aymeric plans to put an offline mode of the app inside browsers, but there is still the issue of security during the query phase. Decentralization is envisioned as a solution, which can be usable on different networks. Aymeric provides links to various projects he has worked on, including Bitcoin wallets and Zcash wallets made simple.</p>
