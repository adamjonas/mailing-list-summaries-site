    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent communication on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor made the statement that it is impossible to break SSS (Shamir Secret Sharing). However, it was also emphasized that it is important to ensure that the scheme being used is actually SSS and not a modified version. Many schemes that claim to be SSS are not, as they may have included arbitrary hashes that destroy the properties of the original scheme. An example of this is the old broken armory implementation which resulted in a real weakness rather than just a theoretical one. It is therefore crucial to verify the integrity of the scheme being used before relying on its security.</p>
