    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When discussing Bitcoin with non-Bitcoin users, two of their major concerns are highlighted. Firstly, the fear that if they enter an incorrect address, they will not be able to retrieve their Bitcoin. Secondly, they would like the option of a two-step confirmation system when dealing with people they do not know. This would allow them to give final approval of the transaction and act as an escrow if both parties approve within a certain timeframe. The two-step system would work for either concern and could potentially alleviate anxiety around Bitcoin transactions. The author acknowledges that this may not be the correct forum for such thoughts but thanks the reader for their time.</p>
