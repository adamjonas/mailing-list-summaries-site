    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion started with the concern over the number one problem in Japan with BIP39 seeds that is with English words, as Japanese people find it difficult to spell English words while writing down their phrase. The author argued that defining "everyone should only use English because ASCII is easier to plan for" is not a good way to move forward as a currency. He then challenged those who want an English-only mnemonic standard to entrust their own money to their abilities to carefully write down Japanese characters, which would be much harder for them. The author also mentioned that many Japanese people know English and other European languages, but if BIP39 had only Japanese wordlists, it would be challenging for non-Japanese-literate family and friends to recover their mnemonic phrases. In such cases, the phrases cannot be called “mnemonics” at all. The author requested a discussion of language identification strings appropriate for use with the BIP39 standard, as he wants to implement them all, including seven non-English wordlists, and four more pending in open pull requests. The discussion has veered into criticism of multi-language support, raising a hue and cry of “English only!” which is not artificially restricted to English.</p>
