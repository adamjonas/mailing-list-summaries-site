    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around whether it is better for miners to relay a replacement transaction (C) over the original transactions (A and B), which may not always result in higher fees. It is argued that it is better for miners to know about C as it costs them nothing, but not knowing about it may result in less earnings. For those creating C, it is better for their transactions to be mined instead of the more expensive A and B transactions. Overall, including more transactions in blocks benefits everyone except full nodes that may be burdened with extra transactions that are not profitable to mine. However, there may be limits on how many times an attacker can cheaply reorganize transactions into something with a higher fee rate. Lastly, it is noted that considering only increased feerate for replacement may not always be more profitable as it depends on the state of the mempool. The problem still exists even if a miner has enough transactions to fill the next block. The assumption of an effectively continuous distribution of feerates in the mempool is not always true.</p>
