    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange between Rusty Russell and Luke Dashjr, they discussed the rule that standard transactions must still work in regards to alt-stack usage. While altstack is completely standard, it is generally unused and only a theoretical concern. However, Rusty clarified that P2SH or Segwit scripts that use the alt-stack will pass standardness checks and be relayed by recent Bitcoin Core software.Luke Dashjr then shifted the conversation to the more severe standardness change of the added requirement that some of the pubkeys in a multisig must be parsable. He mentioned that people have reported difficulty retrieving their funds due to this change but that, like lowS, it was only a change to the standardness rules and not a consensus change. These funds are not necessarily lost permanently and can be retrieved with miner help.Finally, Luke expressed his concerns about BIP 117, a change in consensus rules that could potentially cause permanent loss of well-secured funds. He argued that this change cannot be compared to previous changes in only the standardness rules.</p>
