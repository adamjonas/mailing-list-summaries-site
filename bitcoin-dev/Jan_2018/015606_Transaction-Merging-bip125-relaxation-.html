    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd challenged the assumption that most transactions don't have change. He stated that almost all transactions have change because it is rare for inputs to exactly match requested payment. However, Ryan disagreed with this statement, saying it was a common misconception and claimed that good coin selection could avoid change about 40-50% of the time, although he admitted that this rate would be lower in practice. Ryan also suggested some tricks for avoiding change, such as "miner sacrifice" and "output selection". He acknowledged that these tips would not be applicable to consumer wallets but could work well for services. The conversation then moved on to a discussion about transaction merging and its feasibility. Todd argued that relaxing bip125 rules could lead to DoS vectors and push other transactions out of the mempool. In summary, the conversation covered two main topics: the misconception around change in transactions and the challenges of transaction merging.</p>
