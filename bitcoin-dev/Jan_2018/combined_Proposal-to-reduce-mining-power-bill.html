        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>An email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation discussed a new algorithm that could potentially reduce the electricity cost of mining Bitcoin. The proposed algorithm involves the use of the concept of "next-coinbase" and expiring threads. The consensus chooses who can participate in the next round, after which selected miners are allowed to participate. This algorithm reduces the difficulty/power-bill by 1/2^N for each round. Additionally, with the addition of thread expiration, there is little motivation for anyone to shell/buy "next-coinbase" addresses since their utility is limited.The proposal introduces the concept of "spent" next-coinbase versus "un-spent" one, similar to UTXO. A next-coinbase would only be valid if it has not been previously used to mine a block. Discussions also touch on how N is determined, how reorgs are handled, how difficulty interacts with the proposed algorithm, how miner anonymity is preserved, and how the scheme reduces electricity usage.Furthermore, the proposal involves using next-coinbase addresses and an algorithm that restricts the number of miners allowed to mine each block based on the availability of unspent next-coinbase addresses. A thread expiration system is also suggested to prevent large miners from monopolizing the network. While the proposed approach could reduce energy costs, concerns were raised about its potential impact on Bitcoin's transaction-ordering security as well as its susceptibility to attacks by large miners. One concern raised is that large mining farms submitting multiple different "next-coinbase" addresses in many different blocks could lead to increased mining centralization. Additionally, discussions mention the issue of large miners creating "miner tokens" to increase their chances of mining nearly every single round, which artificially raises the difficulty target and does not reduce energy use. In the long term, this behavior artificially raises the difficulty target.Overall, the thread concludes that while the proposed algorithm reduces the electricity bill, the hardware needed stays the same since for each round the miner participates in, it will try to mine as fast as possible and so use as much hardware as possible. The context includes a Segwit nested address and a PGP RSA code. Lastly, the email thread mentions an HTML attachment being scrubbed from a URL. There are many questions and concerns about the proposal that need further investigation before it can be implemented.</p>
