        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Kalle Rosenbaum has identified an issue with BIP120, Proof of Payment. He explains that if there is a soft fork, a server verifying PoPs will accept a PoP as valid without checking any new Bitcoin rules. This problem arises because a server can be fooled by a segwit transaction, since it doesn't have a witness to verify and hence will accept any PoP with an empty scriptSig. Kalle admits that he does not have a good solution for the soft fork problem and invites any ideas on how to fix it. Apart from this issue, Kalle notes that on-chain payments are no longer in demand, and interest or need for PoP as a concept seems low. Requiring all software using PoP to upgrade to a new PoP specification on each soft-fork is not sufficient. Therefore, Kalle suggests withdrawing BIP120 and BIP121 if there is no good solution to the soft-fork issue. Mycelium currently implements BIP120, but Kalle is unsure if any other software aside from his own implements it. He requests information about such implementations so that he can discuss them.</p>
