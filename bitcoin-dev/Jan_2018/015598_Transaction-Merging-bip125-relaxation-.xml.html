    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposes a simple idea to merge multiple unconfirmed transactions by stripping extraneous inputs and change. However, this is not possible due to the bip125 rule which states that the replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions. The author questions whether it is possible or reasonable to relax this rule or change it to allow their use-case without introducing any DoS vectors. The author has been trying to use bip125 to do "transaction merging" on the fly and found that coin selection was easier than anticipated. However, the real problem lies in tracking the mess when a replaced transaction gets confirmed after a new one has been created to accomplish the same goal. One solution proposed is to only consider a transaction replaceable if it has change, so that payments can immediately be made that source the change and provide safety in a reorg.</p>
