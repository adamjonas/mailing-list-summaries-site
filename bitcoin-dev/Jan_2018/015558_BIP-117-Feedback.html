    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the situation for BIP 117 and BIP-141 has taken place. As per BIP-141, the script must not fail and result in exactly a single TRUE on the stack. It has long been non-standard for P2SH scripts to not follow the same rule. However, this doesn't affect the alt-stack which is a completely separate stack. The rule here is "standard transactions must still work" and it was violated with low-S, but the transformation was arguably trivial. On the other hand, use of altstack is completely standard, though in practice it's unused and so only a theoretical concern. No single standard/BIP uses the altstack at all.</p>
