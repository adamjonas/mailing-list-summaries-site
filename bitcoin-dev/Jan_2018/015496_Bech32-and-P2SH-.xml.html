    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is questioning why the previously discussed P2SH² improvements were omitted from Bech32. They suggest that it might be worth revising to add this feature before deployment becomes too widespread. The concept involves having the address include a single SHA256 hash of the public key or script, which would enable relaying of the "middle-hash" as a way to prove that the final hash is a hash itself and not embedded data spam. The sender would perform the second hash to produce the output. Bech32 is seen as a missed opportunity to add this feature since it is likely that everyone will upgrade to it at some point in the future.</p>
