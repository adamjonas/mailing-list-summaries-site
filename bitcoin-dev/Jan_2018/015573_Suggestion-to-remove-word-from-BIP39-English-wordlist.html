    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion has been made to remove the word "satoshi" from the BIP39 English wordlist due to it being an unnecessary security risk. The concern is that malicious third parties could index what they find and test every occurrence of "satoshi" for a lead to a seed, making it easier to identify a Bitcoin seed if found. It is argued that the security threat is not necessarily increased by the inclusion of the word "satoshi," as any word list that looks like a seed would be tested for use as a Bitcoin seed regardless. However, some still believe that removing the word from the list would be a reasonable improvement. A link to the wordlist in question is provided for reference.</p>
