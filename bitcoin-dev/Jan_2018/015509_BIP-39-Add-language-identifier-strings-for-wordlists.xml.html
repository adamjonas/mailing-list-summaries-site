    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation in this discussion thread centers around the use of BIP39 and subsequent BIPs like BIP44. One of the main concerns raised is the advantages and disadvantages of using mnemonic as a seed over writing down a seed directly. While a mistake in writing down a seed can result in trouble in finding out what's wrong, it is much harder to make a mistake when writing down words. The use of BIP39/44 is deemed confusing and dangerous for recovering funds.The proposal to enhance BIP39 is also discussed. This includes specifying canonical native language strings to identify each word list, as well as short ASCII language codes. Properly vetted language identifier strings would facilitate language identification in user interface options or menus, which would promote interface consistency between implementations. Supporting multiple languages seems quite useful, but a replacement for BIP-39 would be a good opportunity to produce a better English dictionary.Another suggestion given is to create a new standard where words are mapped to integers rather than to a literal string, and for each language, a mapping from words to integers would be published. Very few wallets support anything other than English, which can lead to vendor lock-in and long-term loss of funds if a rare non-English wallet disappears. Wallets need to be able to distinguish between the old and new standard, so un-upgraded BIP 39 wallets should consider all new mnemonics invalid.The author proposes the addition of information to existing wordlists in various languages, including strings that can be used to indicate the part of speech and gender of each word. The author requests that the strings be ascertained from the original pull request contributors. If the proposal is accepted, a pull request will be opened suggesting a format for incorporating this information into the repository. However, the vetting of appropriate strings will need to be left to native speakers or experts in their respective languages.Finally, the conversation touches on the need to find a way to overhaul the whole BIP39/43/44 ad hoc mess to make things simpler for users. The security risks involved in printing anything are also discussed, as well as the missing feature of being able to derive wallets from xpriv. Links to resources for Bitcoin transactions, Zcash wallets, dynamic blocklists, passwords list, anti-spies and private torrents, and GitHub repositories are provided by the author.</p>
