    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 23 January 2018, Ondřej Vejpustek via bitcoin-dev shared a link to a scheme on the bitcointalk forum. In response, Adam mentioned that it seemed like the Makwa sites had independently rediscovered it. Ondřej also shared that he found out that Makwa, a hashing function which received special recognition in the Password Hashing Competition, supports delegation, and is similar to the suggested scheme. However, both schemes have two drawbacks - no proof that the host computes what they are supposed to do, and delegation being far slower than normal computation. According to the Makwa paper, delegation is typically 100 to 1000 times slower. As a result, Ondřej doubts there is a scheme that suits their needs.</p>
