        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gregory Maxwell, co-founder of Blockstream, has resigned from the company to focus on independent work in deep protocol and cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin. Maxwell had hoped that Blockstream could act as an anchor of support for technology development while also helping to grow the community due to significant underinvestment in Bitcoin technology when the company was founded. However, today, the Bitcoin industry has matured and Bitcoin Core receives significant contributions from many organizations and a large volunteer community. Blockstream plans to continue contributing to technology development in Bitcoin. Maxwell's resignation means he can go back to working on the things he finds most exciting without managing staff or dealing with non-Bitcoin blockchain applications. He is excited about new technology coming to production and the continuing maturation of Bitcoin as a subject for academic research. Although he will no longer have insight into Blockstream's activities or a Blockstream email address, he can be reached at his xiph.org and Gmail email addresses.</p>
