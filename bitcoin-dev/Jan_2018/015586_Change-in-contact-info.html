    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The co-founder of Blockstream, Gregory Maxwell, has resigned from the company in order to focus on independent work in deep protocol and cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin. When Blockstream was founded, there was significant underinvestment in Bitcoin technology; as a result, Maxwell hoped that the company could act as an anchor of support for technology development while also helping to grow the community. Today, the Bitcoin industry has matured and Bitcoin Core receives significant contributions from many organizations and a large volunteer community. Blockstream plans to continue contributing to technology development in Bitcoin. For Maxwell, this means he can go back to working on the things he finds most exciting without managing staff or dealing with non-Bitcoin blockchain applications. He is excited about new technology coming to production and the continuing maturation of Bitcoin as a subject for academic research. Maxwell will no longer have insight into Blockstream's activities or a Blockstream email address but can be reached at his xiph.org and Gmail email addresses.</p>
