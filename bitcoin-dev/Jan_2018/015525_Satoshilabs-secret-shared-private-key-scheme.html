    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd expressed his concern regarding the "plausible deniability" feature of Trezor wallets. The feature allows users to have multiple passphrases, with each passphrase leading to a different wallet, one of which is hidden. However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that the key derivation function used in the feature is weak enough for passphrases to be easily brute-forced. This led to a discussion on the real-life scenarios where this functionality would be useful. Some argued that attackers are generally either the wrench type or the crypto-nerd type, making it unlikely for them to combine both types of attacks. Others shared their experience of carrying decoy wallets when living in Brazil, and how most perpetrators will take things at face value and be satisfied with getting something. Moreover, there's no limit to the number of passphrases one can use, making it even more implausible for an attacker to keep searching for wallets.</p>
