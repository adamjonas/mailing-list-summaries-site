        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Proof-of-loss is an alternative consensus algorithm that aims to address the drawbacks of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. It resolves the issue of organic block size limit, risks of mining centralization, and the "nothing at stake" problem. Mirelo, the creator of Proof-of-Loss, has made revisions to the algorithm and is requesting feedback on it. The revisions include a more explicit definition of transaction rights, an overview of how the algorithm works, and the inclusion of the current block height in the proof-of-loss data. Additionally, Mirelo corrected transaction prioritization and inactivity fees and revised the design. The new version includes an introduction with examples and incorporates the current block height in the proof-of-loss data to make serial chaining easier to enforce. Revisions were also made to transaction prioritization, which now uses fees instead of rights, and inactivity fees. The updated version can be found at <a href="https://proof-of-loss.money/">https://proof-of-loss.money/</a>. Mirelo has shared an update regarding the inclusion of pseudocode for block validation in a paper. He requests any feedback regarding the update to be directed towards his email or through the links provided on the Proof-of-Loss home page.Mirelo has received feedback on Proof-of-Loss, stating that the previous version lacked a more explicit definition of transaction rights and an overview of how the algorithm works. As a result, he made revisions to include these changes. In addition, he included the current block height in the proof-of-loss data, making serial chaining easier to enforce without needing additional block height information. Proof-of-Loss aims to solve problems such as mining centralization and the "nothing at stake" problem while addressing deficiencies such as the lack of an organic block size limit.Overall, if you want to know more about Proof-of-Loss, visit the website <a href="https://proof-of-loss.money/,">https://proof-of-loss.money/,</a> where you can find comprehensive information on how the algorithm works.</p>
