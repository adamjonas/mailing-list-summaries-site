    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A writer named Jefferson Carpenter has suggested that the maximum difficulty for Bitcoin's SHA256 will be reached in about 400 years by Moore's law. However, this scenario is not scientifically possible as it would require computers to compute one hash for every myriad of atoms in the observable universe, which humans will never be capable of doing. While mathematical breakthroughs may yield a preimage attack on SHA-256 that is significantly better than brute force, it is still impossible for humans to perform such work. The idea that computers will be able to meet Bitcoin's ten-minute target rate within the next four centuries lands in the realm of religion.</p>
