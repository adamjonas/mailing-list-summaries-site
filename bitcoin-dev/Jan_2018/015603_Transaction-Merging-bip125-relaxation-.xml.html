    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the idea of merging multiple unconfirmed transactions, stripping extraneous inputs and change as they go. This is not currently possible due to the bip125 rule which states that "The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions." However, if this rule was removed or relaxed, it could introduce some DoS vectors, or potentially offer some pretty nice savings for everyone. The conversation also touches on the possibility of unrelated people with tx that are not confirming cooperating to merge their disparate tx into a CoinJoin tx with a higher fee rate. With schnorr signatures, incentives may emerge to replace old tx with economically equivalent summary transactions. Although it may be worse for privacy, broadcasting the transaction standalone and then merging it for savings helps keep the more or less fire-and-forget style without adding complexity.</p>
