    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context involves a discussion among members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding whether or not miners incur a cost by leaving transactions out of a block. Some members argue that miners do pay a cost by not being rewarded those fees, while others argue that this is not a question of cost but rather incentive compatibility. Additionally, there is debate about whether miners fill their blocks with transactions paying very high fees at no cost because they get the fees back themselves, and if so, how to discourage this behavior. One proposed solution is to reward the fees of the current block to the miner of the next block (or X blocks after the current one), which would discourage flooding blocks with fake transactions. However, there are concerns about the possible downside of this solution, such as a temporary drop in hashrate if miners power off their equipment during the period without rewards. Overall, the discussion revolves around the incentives and costs for miners in the bitcoin network.</p>
