    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Tim Ruffing proposed the idea of publishing a hash and transaction pair to protect against an attacker changing the transaction on the wire. However, he pointed out that this approach still has weaknesses, as a powerful attacker could deploy an attack even after the key material has been published. Ruffing suggested quantum safe zero-knowledge proofs as a solution, which would substitute the publication of public keys and signatures and eliminate the need for two-step commitments. However, this approach would likely require a hardfork to apply to old transactions. In the absence of practical ZKP and presuming no powerful quantum computing attackers, Ruffing believes the Fawkes signature scheme is sufficient, as quantum attacks are likely to be expensive in the foreseeable future.</p>
