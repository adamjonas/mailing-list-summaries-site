        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion in the conversation thread revolves around secure secret sharing (SSS) and its various implementations. One of the concerns is that SSS should have a forgery utility to deceive attackers who have compromised some of the shares. It is debated whether using complicated algorithms leads to better security or not, and hash functions are found to be ineffective from an information theoretic perspective.To protect the shares against errors and improve detection, it is suggested that proper codes be used. The use of binary extension fields with linear subgroup properties is also discussed, where leaking part of elements would not be ideal but GF(2^256+n) might slow down the implementation.The current proposal for SSS is also scrutinized for its potential insecurity against partial share leakage. KDF is implemented in the proposal to prevent such attacks, but a large block cipher could be used instead. It is mentioned that many things claiming to be SSS aren't, and a large block mode would be a more complete solution, although it's not considered a significant threat.The conversation then shifts to the SLIP39 mnemonic seed generation scheme and its security implementation. Concerns are raised about potential leaks compromising the scheme, and it is suggested that using a large block cipher would be a better approach to mitigate this concern. There is debate about the use of a KDF in the scheme and whether it provides false security and makes the implementation more complicated. One suggestion is to use blind host-delegated KDFs that run on the user's computer instead of the hardware wallet.The lack of versioning in the proposal is also discussed, which may prevent interoperability with other key-related features such as SegWit. However, introducing a version to encode PBKDF2 rounds or different KDFs could lead to worse interoperability, not better. It is also mentioned that key interoperability can be problematic as wallets cannot share keys unless their functionality is identical.Finally, there is a debate about the checksum function used in the proposal. Initially, a 16-bit CRC32 was proposed, but it was later changed to a cryptographically strong function. However, there is an argument between using a checksum and ECC. It is discussed that ECC might not be a good idea because it helps the attacker compute missing information, while only integrity needs to be checked. Ultimately, the use of a truncated cryptographic hash is suggested as it provides comparable security to ECC while being less computationally intensive.</p>
