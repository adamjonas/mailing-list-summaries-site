    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The current proposal for security measures against partial share leakage has been criticized as being insecure. However, it has been argued that the shared secret being an input of KDF should prevent such attacks. For those who have concerns about partial share disclosure, a recommendation has been made to pass individual shares through a large block unkeyed cryptographic permutation before encoding for transmission. This transformation would prevent attacks from leaks of partial share information under reasonable assumptions about the difficulty of inverting the permutation with partial knowledge. Although something similar to this has been considered, it has been deemed as "rolling your own crypto". Instead of a diffusion layer, KDF will be applied on the shared secret.</p>
