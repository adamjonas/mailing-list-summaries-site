    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of merging multiple unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions, with the aim of creating a replacement transaction that pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions. The bip125 rule currently prevents this from happening, as it requires considerable feerate bump, which is not possible to observe due to the smaller size of the merged transaction. However, the thread proposes a solution that considers a transaction replaceable only if it has change, thereby providing safety in a reorg. While there are other hacks that can make the solution work in some cases, merging N unconfirmed transactions would be a straightforward way to potentially offer some pretty nice savings for everyone.</p>
