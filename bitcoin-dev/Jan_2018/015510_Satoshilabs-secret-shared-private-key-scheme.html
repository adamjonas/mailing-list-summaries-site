    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new standard for Shamir Secret Scheme Splitting is being drafted, but there is an issue with the lack of interoperability and versioning, as well as the unconfigurable and weak key derivation function. There is also concern about the 16-bit checksum based on sha2, which could allow for errors in string input. The metadata does not provide enough guidance to avoid accidental mixing of shares from different keys. Additionally, the SSS protocol needs better advice on how to generate additional coefficients randomly to ensure security. However, it is noted that this scheme cannot be used as a brainwallet scheme.</p>
