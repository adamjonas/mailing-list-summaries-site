        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed adding "P2SH² improvements" in the Bech32 format. The proposal involves including a single SHA256 hash of the public key or script in the address, allowing relaying of the "middle-hash" as a way to prove that the final hash is a hash itself and not embedded data spam. Although P2SH² was not considered a serious proposal, Luke thinks it could be worth revising before deployment becomes too widespread. In a recent email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke questioned why P2SH² improvements were not included in Bech32. However, he believes that adding more address diversity at this time would not be good for the ecosystem and suggests considering an address-next proposal with an explicit timeframe of N years out, featuring things like coded expiration times and abilities to have amounts under checksum. A user on the Bitcoin development mailing list suggested using the BIP39 mnemonic format for addresses, noting that it is harder to copy random letters and numbers than simple words. Another user pointed out the lack of user experience testing in the Bech32 proposal and the rush to market without much public review. Overall, the writer suggests that the concept of P2SH² is a missed opportunity for Bech32 and should be revised before deployment becomes too widespread. However, it is also important to consider other features such as coded expiration times and abilities to have amounts under checksum in future proposals.</p>
