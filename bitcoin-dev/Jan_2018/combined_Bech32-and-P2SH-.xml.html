        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, has suggested that the P2SH² improvements were omitted from Bech32. P2SH² involves having an address include the single SHA256 hash of the public key or script, rather than RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)). This would enable relaying the "middle-hash" as a way to prove the final hash is in fact a hash itself, thereby proving it is not embedded data spam. However, Luke believes that this proposal doesn't add much value to Bitcoin today, and interest in "storing data" in outputs should at least not be increasing. Furthermore, people have already rushed Bech32 to market in advance of any public review, so adding more address diversity at this time wouldn't be good for the ecosystem. Luke suggests that instead of focusing on P2SH², we consider working on an address-next proposal that has an explicit timeframe of N years out. This proposal could include things like coded expiration times and abilities to have amounts under checksum, which are more worth considering. Overall, while P2SH² may have been an interesting thought experiment, it doesn't seem to offer many practical benefits in the current context of Bitcoin.</p>
