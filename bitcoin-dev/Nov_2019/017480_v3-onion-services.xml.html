    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is an ongoing effort to upgrade the Bitcoin P2P protocol to support other address types, including onion v3. This effort is being called "addrv2" and contributions are welcome. On November 17, 2019, Mr. Lee Chiffre sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list asking if bitcoin client core supports v3 onion addresses for node addresses. He also asked about I2P addresses and what it would take to get the software to support longer addresses used by i2p and tor v3. Mr. Lee Chiffre is in the process of creating a new bitcoin node that will use v3 hidden service instead of v2. He is looking at bitcoin core and btcd to use but needs to know if they support v3 onion addresses. If not, he needs to know what it would take to get them to support the longer addresses used by i2p and tor v3.The bitcoin-dev mailing list is open for discussion and review of this effort and any contributions are welcome.</p>
