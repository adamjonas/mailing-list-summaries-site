        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Bitcoin developer discussion, the inclusion of version bytes in the xpub in the GLOBAL_XPUB field was questioned. The concern was that the version bytes were superfluous data, and their presence could lead to conflicting versions on different xpubs in the PSBT. Additionally, the transaction format and the rest of the PSBT key-values are network agnostic, making the inclusion of version bytes unnecessary. It was suggested that if network data needed to be attached to the PSBT, a new key should be used instead. The proposed implementation to Bitcoin Core ignores version bytes, as it is simpler to reuse what has been defined before without including unnecessary information. There was no consensus formed on whether other data outside of the public key and chain code should be included or omitted.</p>
