        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list recently discussed the inclusion of version bytes in the xpub in the GLOBAL_XPUB field. Ian Kroozbi questioned the rationale behind including version bytes, suggesting that they were superfluous data and potentially problematic due to conflicting versions on different xpubs in the PSBT. Andrew replied that while xpubs were already a predefined standard, the version bytes did not matter and should be ignored. In the proposed implementation to Bitcoin Core, the version bytes would indeed be ignored. Some argued for keeping additional data such as prefixes that define if the key is used for testnet or mainnet. Ian suggested that attaching network data to the PSBT could be better served by using a new key. He remained undecided about whether or not other data outside of the public key and chain code should be included, but hoped for a discussion on the rationale for either including or omitting it. Some have yet to form an opinion on whether or not to include additional data outside of the public key and chain code, but believe it's worth discussing any rationale for including or omitting it. Overall, there is ongoing debate on the necessity of version bytes in the xpub in the GLOBAL_XPUB field and whether additional data should be included.</p>
