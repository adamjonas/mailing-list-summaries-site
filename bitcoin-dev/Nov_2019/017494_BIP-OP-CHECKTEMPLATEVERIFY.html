    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Developers have announced refinements to the BIP draft for OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, which replaces the previous OP_SECURETHEBAG BIP. The name has been changed to something more appropriate and acceptable to the community. The opcode specification has also been changed to use the argument off of the stack with a primitive constexpr/literal tracker, rather than script lookahead. This refinement permits future soft-fork updates to loosen or remove "constexpr" restrictions. Additionally, there is a more detailed comparison to alternatives in the BIP, and it explains why OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY should be favored even if a future technique may make it semi-redundant.Developers are planning to host a review workshop in Q1 2020, most likely in San Francisco. RPC functions are under preliminary development for testing and evaluation of OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. The new command `sendmanycompacted` shows one way to use OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, and it is still under early design. Standard practices for using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY & wallet behaviors may be codified into a separate BIP. Improvements to the mempool are also under development, including improvements like package relay, which will help make it safe to lift some of the mempool's restrictions on longchains specifically for OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY output trees.These developments are not blockers for proceeding with the BIP, as they are ergonomics and usability improvements that are needed once/if the BIP is activated. Prior mailing list discussions are available on the Bitcoin-Dev website. Many developers have provided feedback on iterations of this design.</p>
