    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Dynamic MaxBlockSize (DMBS) solution involves a 3-byte variable added to the white space in the current block. The first bit can be either 1, 2, or 0. If the last total block transaction fees are greater than the average of the last 100 blocks transaction fees and the current MaxBlockSize is greater than or equal to 0.99 MB, and the MaxBlockSize has not changed in the past 10 blocks, then on the current block number plus nine, the MaxBlockSize will be set to MaxBlockSize multiplied by 1.1. Otherwise, if the MaxBlockSize has changed within the past 10 blocks, on the current block number plus nine, the MaxBlockSize will be set to MaxBlockSize divided by 1.1. However, if the current MaxBlockSize equals 6553.5 MB, no action will be taken.The second bit is a global variable where "9" represents a countdown to the set value action, placed to synchronize network forward changes in "x" blocks. The last two bytes represent the globally accepted MaxBlockSize variable, distributed within each block moving forward in this rightmost (2 byte) factor. The variable portion "000A" (32 Bit value) represents decimal value 10 being 1.0 MB block. Since this presents a theoretical max limit of "FFFF" or 6553.5 MB, a last rule must be added as an error catch.</p>
