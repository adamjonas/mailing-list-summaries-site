    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Carl Dong, a Bitcoin developer, has been working on an implementation of addrv2 (BIP-155) and is seeking feedback on the ongoing discussion. He reached out to Mr. Lee Chiffre via bitcoin-dev mailing list, asking if the I2P and Torv3 address support is what he meant. Carl shared his WIP pull request, merged BIP and the link for ongoing discussion. In response to Carl's query, Mr. Lee Chiffre mentioned that the current Bitcoin client core supports v2 hidden service, but he is in progress of creating a new Bitcoin node which will use v3 hidden service instead of v2. He is looking at bitcoin core and btcd to use but wants to know if any of these or current node software support the v3 onion addresses for the node address. He also asked about I2P addresses and what it would take to get the software to support the longer addresses used by i2p and tor v3.</p>
