    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is questioning the rationale for a bitcoin node to be hidden using Rendezvous (RDV) points like hidden services. They argue that the purpose of Bitcoin is to anonymize communications between nodes and/or clients, not to hide that someone is operating a node. The author suggests that there may be another way to achieve this goal rather than mimicking the Tor network for RDV points with .onion addresses. The author has been operating node-Tor nodes inside the Tor network for about 10 years and believes that using the Tor network for Bitcoin is a bad idea for security and performance reasons. They suggest that their proposal has some interest and that it's open source and made to be used. In a separate thread, Mr. Lee Chiffre asks if any current node software supports v3 onion addresses for node address or I2P addresses. He is in the process of creating a new Bitcoin node that will use v3 hidden service instead of v2 and is looking at Bitcoin Core and btcd to use. Carl Dong responds to Lee Chiffre's inquiry and shares a link to his work-in-progress pull request for implementing addrv2 (BIP-155), which includes support for I2P and Torv3 address.</p>
