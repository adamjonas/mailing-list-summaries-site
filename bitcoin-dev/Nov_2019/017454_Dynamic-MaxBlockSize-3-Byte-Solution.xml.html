    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread in discussion is regarding the proposal of Dynamic MaxBlockSize (DMBS) - 3 Byte Solution, which aims to address the block size issue in a dynamic and efficient manner. While one member of the group has NACKed the proposal due to his belief that Lightning and SegWit have already solved the problem of block size, another member disagrees. According to him, although Segwit has increased the possibilities of using space more efficiently, off-chain constructions like channel factories are yet to be tested and proved effective. Therefore, claiming that we don't need to deal with the block size issue anymore would be bold and unjustified.The DMBS proposal suggests adding a 3-byte variable factor to the white space in the current block to evaluate the market-driven demand and adjust the block size dynamically. The ruleset for this proposal evaluates to YES or NO, depending on whether there is increased system pressure or decreased market pressure. To prevent bloat, the approach limits changes to one change every three hours if there is a market pressure "STATE" occurring. The proposed solution provides a suitable middle ground and addresses concerns dynamically without compromising existing security. However, it remains unclear if the current block can accommodate the 3-byte variable. The author of the proposal seeks feedback from the community on the viability of the solution and its effectiveness in solving the scaling issue.</p>
