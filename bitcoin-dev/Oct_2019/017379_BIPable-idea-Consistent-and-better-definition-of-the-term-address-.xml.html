    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Emil Engler expressed gratitude for the feedback received and announced his decision to write a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for better on-chain privacy. Although it may not be implemented by many wallets, he believes standardization is never wrong and this would be the first step in the right direction. However, there is still a need to find a good term to replace 'address.' Some of the suggestions include Invoice ID, Payment Token, Bitcoin invoice (address), and Bitcoin invoice (path). Chris Belcher's suggestion of 'Bitcoin Invoice' stood out to Emil because of its similarity to the LN term invoice. Finding a consensus about these terms is currently being discussed. A non-text attachment called pEpkey.asc was also included in the email.</p>
