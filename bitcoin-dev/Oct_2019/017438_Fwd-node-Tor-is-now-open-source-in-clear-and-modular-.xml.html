    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Aymeric Vitte has announced that node-Tor, a Javascript implementation of the Tor protocol on server side and inside browsers, is now open source and available under the MIT license. It is not intended to add nodes into the Tor network or implement the Tor Browser features but rather to build projects using the Tor protocol from the browser and/or servers. The Onion Proxy and Onion Router functions are available directly inside the browser which establishes circuits with other nodes understanding the Tor protocol. While it can establish circuits with the Tor network nodes, node-Tor can also act as a Tor node. NLnet via EU Horizon 2020 Next Generation Internet Privacy & Trust Enhancing Technologies financed the project. Node-Tor is fast and extensively tested when video streaming was there, especially with bittorrent or ORDB concept. Its unminified code is only 1 MB, making it quite small for what it does. Node-Tor is not a browser extension/module but pure JS. The possible next steps are to implement elliptic crypto and connections via WebRTC Snowflake as well as integrating it with "Discover and move your coins by yourself" for anonymous blockchain search and anonymous sending of transactions from the browser.</p>
