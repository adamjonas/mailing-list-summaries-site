    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core's BIP 61 REJECT messages feature has been disabled by default since version 0.18.0 and can be enabled using the `-enablebip61` command line option. However, support for REJECT messages will be removed entirely in Bitcoin Core V0.20, expected for release in mid-2020. Adoption of new Bitcoin Core versions across reachable nodes generally takes several months. Nodes on the network cannot generally be trusted to send valid ("reject") messages, so this should only be used when connected to a trusted node. In light of these changes, Marco Falke proposed to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are valid concerns about its removal. There is no mechanism in BIP 61 for advertising that a node will send REJECT messages. Testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent version of Bitcoin Core. Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject" messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee target they set) or listen for the transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.</p>
