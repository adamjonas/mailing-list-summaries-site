    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ancient practice of using clay bulla to account for transactions and keep tokens together has been compared to the use of Bitcoin addresses. The bulla would have to be crushed to reveal its contents, leading to the idea of impressing the token onto the wet bulla before it dried to ensure trust and prevent tampering. Only able to be used once due to destruction upon opening, some bulla even had imprints with noble family seals. Meanwhile, Emil Engler via bitcoin-dev is seeking a consensus on the best replacement term for a Bitcoin address, with suggestions including Invoice ID, Payment Token, Bitcoin invoice (address) and Bitcoin invoice (path). Belcher's suggestion of "Bitcoin Invoice" appeals to Engler due to its similarity to the Lightning Network's term "invoice".</p>
