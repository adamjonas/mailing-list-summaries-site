    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Joachim Strömbergson and an unknown recipient on October 15, 2019, Strömbergson proposed a method of generating a much longer blockchain with a slow timestamp increase without increasing the difficulty. The recipient responded that if this were to happen, it would take about seven minutes for the next retarget period every 2016 blocks, and the difficulty would adjust as if two weeks of blocks had been mined in seven minutes. However, Strömbergson clarified that this calculation does not apply under a time warp attack, where timestamps of all blocks can be faked except for those relevant to the retarget calculation, which are only the first and last block in the 2016 block window. The context suggests that the discussion may be in reference to the non-overlapping difficulty calculation and off-by-one bug.</p>
