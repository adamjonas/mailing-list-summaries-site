        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jimmy Song has proposed adding a new key-value pair to the global context of BIP174, Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). The proposal aims to indicate the network that the coins are on, as it is important for each signer to ensure that the inputs being referenced in the PSBT exist. This information becomes even more crucial when dealing with Proof-of-Reserves inputs.According to the proposal, the suggested key for network in the global key-value store is 0x03. The corresponding value would be a variable integer that specifies the network. For Bitcoin mainnet, the value 0x00 would be used, while for Bitcoin testnet, the value 0x01 would be used. This way, it becomes easier to identify which network the coins belong to.Furthermore, the proposal states that other coins interested in using the PSBT should follow the coin network number from SLIP-0044, but with the high bit removed. This ensures compatibility and consistency across different networks.However, Jon, in his response to the email, argues against the inclusion of a network section in the PSBT. He believes that the only time the network could pose a problem is in the case of a fork-coin. In such cases, adding a network section would not help verify anything and might give a false sense of security. Instead, it could be seen as a security minus.Currently, BitcoinJS utilizes network parameters to allow for the use of addresses in addOutput. However, Jon is considering removing this feature, further questioning the necessity of a network section in the PSBT.Overall, the proposal by Jimmy Song suggests adding a key-value pair to indicate the network in the global context of BIP174, Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions. While it aims to provide clarity and ensure the existence of referenced inputs, there are differing opinions on its usefulness. Nevertheless, the proposal leaves room for potential extension to other networks in the future.</p>
