    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A simple and spam-proof scheme to address the quantum threat in blockchain has been proposed. This scheme involves publishing a transaction on the blockchain that lists pre-quantum signature and hash of post-quantum address. Future transactions would require both pre and post-quantum signatures, making this scheme flexible enough to change as post-quantum addressing improves. To implement this scheme, it should be done a sufficient number of years before quantum becomes a pressing issue. It is important to note that there are two quantum addressing schemes in order of discovery, and if a new discovery shows a second scheme with smaller transactions and faster validation, Soft-fork 2 will refuse upgrades to the first scheme beyond a certain block number for improved performance. There is also a discussion on the feasibility of using zero-knowledge proofs to recover an UTXO with a P2PKH address, which seems plausible but can become complex for arbitrary scripts even if our proof systems and machines are fast enough.</p>
