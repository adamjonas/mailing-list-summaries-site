    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to a Wikipedia entry on "Bulla," it can be considered an almost perfect analogy for Bitcoin addresses in the ancient world. However, the term may not be well known among people. The author proposes using Funding Codes instead, although they think it may not be the best option as codes are usually associated with something more permanent and unchanging than Bitcoin addresses. They also agree that Payment Tokens might cause confusion with other currencies and blockchains. The author raises concerns about the term 'Bitcoin Invoice Address' as invoices imply holding bitcoins and specifying an amount, while addresses don't specify any amounts. Instead, the author suggests using terms like 'Bitcoin Invoice (Address)' or 'Bitcoin Invoice (Path),' which combines the temporary factor with the way money is sent to something. Additionally, the author thinks that 'Funding Code' could lead to misunderstandings as it implies more to donate to something. Thus, the suggested terms include Invoice ID, Payment Token, Bitcoin invoice (address), Bitcoin invoice (path), Bulla, and Funding code.</p>
