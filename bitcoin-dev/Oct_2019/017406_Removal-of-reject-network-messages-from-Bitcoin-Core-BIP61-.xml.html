    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A P2P protocol change should be exposed as a version increment and a BIP rather than just a conditional service. The intention is to retain this protocol indefinitely, so exposing it conditionally would only make sense if it were a service bit. However, it is still a protocol change. According to BIP61, all implementations of the P2P protocol version 70,002 and later should support the reject message. Following a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, support for BIP 61 REJECT messages was not removed from Bitcoin Core in V0.19. Instead, the behavior is that REJECT messages are disabled by default but can be enabled using the `-enablebip61` command line option. Andreas Schildbach asked if there is a NODE_* bit that can be used to pick peers that support this feature. The email includes links to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the BIP61 documentation.</p>
