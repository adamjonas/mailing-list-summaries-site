        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new layer of protection for cryptocurrency wallets called ChainWallet has been proposed. This involves creating a chain of hashes over the private key to generate a new wallet from it, with the length of the chain easily memorized as an exponent. Using SHA-256 or other algorithms is suggested to add "time" as part of the puzzle rather than increasing entropy. The proposed method is compared to BrainWallets but with an added chain, making brute force attacks practically impossible. A minimum length for the chain and blocking commonly used words for the password can prevent misuse. ChainWallet could be used as an alternative to BIP39, where a base and an exponent instead of 24 words and a password would define the length of the chain. A proof of concept for ChainWallet in C++ can be found on GitHub, while discussions about it are ongoing on various Reddit threads.Another proposal by Saulo Fonseca involves creating a key stretching technique as an additional layer of protection for hodlers' wallets. However, users cannot prove that they are using this technique or petertodd's timelock encryption, giving attackers little incentive to stop physically attacking until they have a spendable UTXO. It has been suggested that on-chain timelocks, delete-the-bits plus a rangeproof and a zero-knowledge proof, or a similar thought proposed by adam3us, could achieve the same effect. Jeremy Rubin also had an idea for such a proof, with the link to adam3us's described thought available at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311000.0</a>.</p>
