        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the need for a replacement term for "Bitcoin address" to better reflect its purpose and discourage repeated use of the same receiving address. Suggestions include "Payment Password" or "Transaction Password," "Invoice ID," "Payment Token," and "Bitcoin Invoice." Some members of the community are skeptical about whether these proposals would be effective, and there is a need to find a consensus on the best replacement term.Emil Engler has proposed using a temporary pseudonym to identify a person, while Chris Belcher's suggestion of "Bitcoin Invoice" has gained support. The concept of Bitcoin addresses and public keys are fundamentally different from each other, and it is important to note that neither serves as a password. The use of clay bulla in ancient times has been compared to the use of Bitcoin addresses, as they had to be destroyed upon opening and could only be used once.Emil Engler has written a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for better on-chain privacy, while Marco Falke expressed appreciation for the use of the term "bitcoin invoice address" in the proposal. The idea of using a Bitcoin invoice has been proposed before, with Chris Belcher's proposal gaining support from Kalle Alm. While changing a commonly-used name like "Bitcoin address" may be difficult, it could lead to significant privacy gains. Feedback on the proposals is encouraged.The term "invoice" is being used in Bitcoin transactions to help bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the emerging cryptocurrency world. This could prove useful in making the transition smoother for both merchants and customers as more businesses accept Bitcoin as a payment option. Generating an invoice for any transaction can also help streamline the process of Bitcoin transactions.Overall, it is important to make the language surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies easily accessible to people who may not be familiar with the technology. By simplifying Bitcoin-related terminology, individuals who are not familiar with the technology can better understand how to navigate and participate in the decentralized financial system. This will help encourage the widespread adoption of these decentralized financial systems and make them more accessible to everyone.</p>
