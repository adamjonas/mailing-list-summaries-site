    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core has announced that support for BIP 61 REJECT messages will be removed entirely in version 0.20, expected to be released in mid-2020. The PR to remove support has already been merged into Bitcoin Core's master branch. However, in the upcoming release of version 0.19, REJECT messages are disabled by default and can only be enabled using the `-enablebip61` command line option. Adoption of new versions across reachable nodes generally takes several months, so software that currently uses REJECT messages from public nodes for troubleshooting issues have plenty of time to transition to one of the recommended alternatives. These include inspecting log messages produced by a recent version of Bitcoin Core, testing validity of blocks or transactions through specific RPCs, and using fee estimation to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a transaction has propagated the network.</p>
