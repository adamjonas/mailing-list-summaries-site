    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joachim Str√∂mbergson proposed a method to generate a longer chain with a slow timestamp increase without increasing difficulty, which would take about 7 minutes of block time seconds for the next retarget period, every 2016 blocks. This approach, however, does not apply under a time warp attack since fake timestamps can be created for all blocks except for those relevant to the retarget calculation. This was in reference to the non-overlapping difficulty calculation and off-by-one bug. The height of the chain can be extended instead of limiting its width, but this method would not be effective unless the timewarp off-by-one bug is resolved. Rate limiting based on chainwork would slow down a timewarped low work header chain, where there would be a maximum rate at which the headers could be sent, around 32KB/s. It would take about a month to send 100GB.</p>
