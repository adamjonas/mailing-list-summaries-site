    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this email suggests that address relay in the Bitcoin network is under-specified and proposes a solution to decouple address relay considerations from light/full node/block-relay-only. The proposed solution involves making it explicit whether a node promises to participate in address relay by forwarding unsolicited messages and responding to GETADDR. The author suggests two ways to implement this: 2 new service bits or per-link-direction negotiation using BIP-155. The author believes that having more flexibility with per-link-direction negotiation is better for the future of the protocol, where some nodes might want to opt-out of addr relay for a subset of their links. The author suggests extending BIP-155 with per-link-direction negotiation, but they are interested in the opinion of the community. Two references are included in the email for further reading.</p>
