    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The schnorr/taproot/tapscript BIPs are now open for review and the developers want to get as much feedback as possible before implementing them. Reviewing the BIPs can be difficult as not many people are familiar with reviewing them and there are numerous concepts involved. For this reason, a structured review period has been proposed, where participants will receive guidance on how to go through the BIPs and identify any issues that need changes or give an "ACK" that the drafts should move forward into implementation/deployment phases. Participating in the review period presents several benefits such as deeply understanding schnorr and taproot, being a stakeholder in Bitcoin consensus development, supporting/safeguarding decentralisation of Bitcoin protocol development and having fun. Those who are interested in participating can sign up via a link provided in the context. AJ Towns is credited with doing most of the heavy lifting to get this proposal going.</p>
