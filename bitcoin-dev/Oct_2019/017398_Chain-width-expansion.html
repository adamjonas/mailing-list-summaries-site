    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses generating longer chains with a slow timestamp increase without increasing difficulty. If this happens, the time between blocks would be reduced to about 7 minutes instead of 10 minutes and the difficulty would adjust as if two weeks of blocks had been mined in 7 minutes during the next retarget period of every 2016 blocks. However, this calculation does not apply during a time warp attack, where timestamps can be faked for all blocks except the first and last block in the 2016 block window. This is in reference to the non-overlapping difficulty calculation and off-by-one bug.</p>
