    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation discusses the possibility of faking a block height in Bitcoin's Proof of Work system. It is suggested that it would be difficult to fake a higher block height without convincing proof, which could include providing headers from the tip down and another proof of height for the block at 1m-2000. However, this would require a long chain and be difficult to achieve with a high difficulty.It is also discussed how to generate a much longer chain with a superslow timestamp increase without increasing difficulty, but it would take about 7 minutes of block time seconds for the next retarget period, every 2016 blocks, and the difficulty would adjust. The calculation does not apply under time warp attack, where timestamps of all blocks except for those relevant to the retarget calculation can be faked.</p>
