    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A recent technical report and short post have been released concerning HTLC, which states that the security of HTLC relies on miners being altruistic or myopic. The report explains that it took 150 lines of code to make bitcoind non-myopic, indicating that this reliance might not be sustainable in the long term. However, the authors of the report have discovered an alternative to HTLC called MAD-HTLC, which is provably secure as everyone's best interest is to behave as desired. They have notified relevant teams in advance and are open to comments. Links to the technical report and short post can be found in the message.</p>
