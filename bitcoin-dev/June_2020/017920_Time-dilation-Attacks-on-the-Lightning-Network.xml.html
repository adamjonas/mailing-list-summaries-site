    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gleb Naumenko and Antoine Riard have explored time-dilation attacks on Lightning and written a blog post and paper detailing their findings. The work is believed to be interesting for anyone curious about LN or other second-layer protocols in Bitcoin. The post discusses how an attacker can steal funds from LN users using time-dilation attacks, which involve delaying block delivery to the victim so they can't access recent blocks in a timely manner. The attacker then exploits this by making legit actions on the Lightning Network towards the victim's channels while committing a different state instead. The authors demonstrate three ways the attacker can steal funds and discuss countermeasures which may increase the attack cost. They also note that many Lightning users are currently vulnerable to Eclipse attacks but strong anti-Eclipse measures are the key solution.</p>
