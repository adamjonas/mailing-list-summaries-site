    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj suggested running Bitcoin fullnode on clearnet while running Lightning node over Tor to mitigate the issue of eclipsing of Bitcoin nodes. However, there is a risk of correlation between the Lightning node and the Bitcoin node when transactions are broadcast with the attached Bitcoin node. To avoid this correlation, the Lightning node should probably connect, over Tor, to some random Bitcoin fullnodes/Electrum servers and broadcast txes to them. The idea of using Tor network for bitcoin was dismissed as it is based on a wrong postulate. Instead, the Tor protocol can be used with no story of exit nodes and hidden services. A universal and generic architecture has been proposed to anonymize any application/protocol and turn it into an independent decentralized p2p network inside browsers and servers. LN and bitcoin nodes would be relays and/or RDV points and/or clients and serving parties, some Tor network nodes could be used in the middle also. The question for possible future tests is whether there is a simple way to pipe the bitcoin protocol via stdin/stdout.</p>
