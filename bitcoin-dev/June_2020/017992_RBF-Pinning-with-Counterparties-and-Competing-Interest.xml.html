    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, a user was hoping for one of Bitcoin's inventive cryptographers to describe how someone with an adaptor signature could use the information to create a pubkey and resolve the PTLC. However, if this is not possible, they suggest advocating for making pay-to-revealed-adaptor-signature possible using something like OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. It was suggested that the signed message could be a signature to `SIGHASH_NONE` and embedded in a transaction with `OP_RETURN`. If doing so, `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` is also required to embed the adaptor signature for spending from that transaction in the transaction being spent, and it implies `A[p4s] = a[p4s] * G` is a one-time-use keypair.</p>
