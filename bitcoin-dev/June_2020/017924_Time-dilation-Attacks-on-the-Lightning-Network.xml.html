    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Tor network's dependence on a limited set of exit nodes weakens its security. However, Tor hidden services provide good within-Tor rendezvous points. The issue arises with Tor-to-clearnet connections, as miners won't run over Tor due to latency issues. One solution could be to make a bridge between Tor and clearnet by running two fullnodes on the computer. One fullnode is on the public network but runs in 'blocksonly' mode so that it doesn't propagate transactions attached to the public IP. The other fullnode is on the Tor network and has an '-addnode' to the public-network node via 'localhost'. This method would help propagate transactions through the Tor-fullnode while maintaining privacy. However, the eclipse attacker could still attack all Tor exit nodes and block outgoing transaction traffic to perform eclipse attacks. Therefore, it is important to consider all aspects before implementing this solution.</p>
