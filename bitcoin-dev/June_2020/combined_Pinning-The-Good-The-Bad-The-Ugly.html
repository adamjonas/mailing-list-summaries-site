        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network (LN) relies on participants confirming transactions unilaterally, making it their responsibility to enforce their balance and protect against double-spends. However, network mempools are not guaranteed to be convergent, which can lead to issues with low-fee HTLC-preimage pinning. The Anchor Output proposal aims to allow parties to unilaterally bump feerates of their HTLC-timeout transactions, while Package Relay support could help address scenarios where revoked or conflicting commitments are pinned in mempools. RBF opt-in rules can also be amended to improve the efficiency of network mempools and create an honest bid market for contracting applications.Despite these measures, currently deployed LN peers are not secure against certain motivated attackers who have knowledge of both layers. Heavy and long-term work is required at the base layer to ensure scenario 3 security. Antoine suggests implementing an anchor proposal for mempool-congestion safety, working on package relay to solve commitment-level pinning, studying the best base layer mechanism for feerate package discovery, and increasing delta and deadline timelocks in the meantime.Antoine also references t-bast's piece on LN transactions and a new attack against LN payment atomicity. While these scenarios do have a setup cost involving channel opening onchain fees and rebalancing, it is orders of magnitude lower if you can steal from meaningful channels. Overall, ensuring the security and efficiency of the Lightning Network will require ongoing efforts to address potential vulnerabilities and improve the underlying technology.</p>
