    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new building block called WabiSabi has been introduced as part of research into improving CoinJoins. Unlike blind signatures, WabiSabi utilizes keyed verification anonymous credentials to verify honest participation of users in centrally coordinated CoinJoin protocols. Blind signatures require standard denominations associated with a key and cannot convey more than a single bit of information from the signer to the verifier, both of which are coordinators in this setting. On the other hand, anonymous credentials carry attributes, and in this case, homomorphic value commitments as in Confidential Transactions. This is an early draft with a narrow scope, introducing the abstract building block. Feedback and criticism about the scheme and its potential applications are welcomed at this stage. The researchers do not address the structure of CoinJoin transactions, fee structures, or other implementation details yet, but discussion of these aspects is welcome. The repository for WabiSabi can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi,">https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi,</a> and the latest version is available at <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf">https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf</a>.</p>
