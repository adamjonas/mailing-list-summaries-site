        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The post introduces the concept of distributed, delegated pre-signed transactions (DDPST) and explains its relevance for various applications. Pre-signed transactions (PSTs) are currently used in off-chain protocols to enable restricted access to funds with delegated custody as a countermeasure against attacks. The author argues that distributing custody of PSTs across multiple entities can provide a defence-in-depth against attacks and new trust models for privacy using multi-party computation. Examples of how DDPST can be applied in vault-custody protocols and justice transactions in the current Lightning Network model are provided. In the case of vault-custody protocols, distributing custody of the recovery transaction offers a defence-in-depth against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, delegating custody enables outsourcing of the monitor and response service, and proactive security models can be instanciated such that successful attacks must occur in a limited time-frame. For justice transactions, distributing custody of the justice transaction among a set of independent watchtowers with an accountability system in-place for their actions can provide a more robust incentive structure and a new privacy mechanism for both operational security of a business and mitigation of targeted attacks such as bribery.The post invites feedback on the concept and offers to use any application that can benefit from DDPST in the proof of concept code. It concludes with references for further reading on custody protocols using Bitcoin Vaults, lightning watchtower, private altruist watchtowers, and proactive security. Overall, the post suggests that DDPST has the potential to enhance security and privacy in various applications by distributing custody of pre-signed transactions across multiple entities.</p>
