        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about improving Bitcoin's blockchain layer privacy, one participant suggests an alternative method involving paying someone to add their UTXO to a transaction for fees. They acknowledge the success of other CoinJoin-based protocols such as JoinMarket and SwapMarket but argue that such protocols have some overheads and require more UTXOs and bigger transactions than necessary. The privacy properties of unequal output size CoinJoins are not well understood, while evenly sized output CoinJoins lead to efficiency.The participant contemplates a scenario where Bitcoin becomes mainstream, and transaction prices increase dramatically, making some protocols uneconomical and leading to the use of L2 technology. In this setting, having evenly sized UTXOs makes sense as it is cheap and simple. However, this approach only works when exact values are unimportant and requires fee hacks. The participant concludes that although their initial idea has too many regulatory risks, an arbitrary-amount scheme that provides strong assurances in an efficient manner could be explored further.Sebastian Geisler proposes the concept of out-of-band transaction fees that would allow for privacy-preserving payment of fees in Bitcoin transactions. The system could be used in CoinJoin-like protocols to introduce further ambiguity without leaking information about participants. Out-of-band transaction accelerators already exist, so having a standardized system for this type of fee payment would be preferable to having every pool implement their API.Each service would need to announce which means of payment it supports and allow users and miners to choose when paying/redeeming fees. The central questions are how to build such an out-of-band "transaction bounty" system, how to standardize it, and how can the centralizing effects from it be mitigated. One possibility would be for single-operator services to provide both standardized user and miner APIs as well as an optional UI. Miners that included a transaction would authenticate their claim on the bounty with a unique public key.Overall, out-of-band payment options could help certain protocols and improve Bitcoin's blockchain layer privacy. CoinJoin-like protocols could also benefit from out-of-band payments to introduce further ambiguity without leaking information about participants. Standardizing such a system would be preferable to having every pool implement their API, but centralization risks should be mitigated.</p>
