    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ferdinando M. Ametrano has submitted a pull request to the bips repo to remove the *proprietary* and *proof-of-reserves* types from the PSBT specifications, which are not covered in the BIP174 test vectors. He questions the rationale for these types as they have nothing to do with the operations required to finalize a valid transaction from PSBT manipulation. He believes that any information content that they could provide for non-standard PSBT manipulation could stay in the *unknown* field without any loss of generality. According to him, as long as BIP174 clearly prescribes that unknown data must be kept during PSBT manipulation, that should be enough. He also mentions that he has a project where they include proprietary information in the PSBT, and any PSBT software supporting unknown data keeps their proprietary information and their proprietary software retrieves that data from serialized PSBT with no problem. Therefore, there is no need for a PSBT implementation to provide explicit support for *proprietary* and *proof-of-reserves* types. He concludes that his last observation is reinforced by the evidence of all PSBT implementations he knows of, including bitcoin core and HWI, not implementing proprietary and proof-of-reserve types, which might be ignored if included in BIP174.</p>
