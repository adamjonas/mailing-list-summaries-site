    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, the sender faced some issues while sending Bitcoin test transactions. Green wallet segwit v1 send resulted in funds being sent to the wrong address and Blockchain.com's wallet also behaved similarly. Blockchain.info's explorer suffers from "Unable to decode output address" when viewing a tx with v1 output and inability to display address details for a v1 address. Bitgo accepts a v1 send address but then a "Server error" during send occurs. Coinbase (web) reported on the final step of sending: Your send failed Please enter a valid email or Bitcoin address. BRD sends successfully to v1. Bitrefill, casa, xapo, wasabi all previously failed address validation and still fail address validation. Binance, bitmex, kraken all previously failed address validation but now accept v1 addresses. While Riccardo noted that Aqua successfully sent to Pieter's address, Ive been informed Aqua has disabled send to v1 addresses for now. The issue has been reported to Blockstream and Blockchain team to let them know about this.</p>
