        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev group, AdamISZ, proposed an idea for "bitcoin fungibility markets," which could apply to scenarios where there is a market for liquidity and privacy is a high priority. His proposal aims to make selective censorship difficult using cryptographic blinding and a proof-of-misbehavior approach. However, Greg Maxwell pointed out a flaw in the idea, which involved the potential for makers to falsely claim censorship after not sending the plaintext. Reflecting on this further, it seems that the problem is much more difficult than originally anticipated. Many solutions presume the existence of an uncensorable bulletin board in order to create a new one or use the blockchain for that function, but that is too slow and expensive.The proposed design aims to disincentivize censorship and make it difficult to achieve. The design is not specific to CoinJoin and would work similarly for other bitcoin-native systems where the concept of a "liquidity maker" applies. The current redundancy model used in Joinmarket, which relies on 2-3 independent IRC servers, has limitations due to the possibility of collusion among servers to selectively censor participants. The proposed model would allow Joinmarket or similar systems to run on a single bulletin board server with reduced resource requirements.Ruben Somsen, a Bitcoin developer, responded to AdamISZ's inquiry regarding creating a censorship-resistant data layer without using the blockchain. Ruben suggests that it is possible to create a custom blockchain for this specific purpose using Blind Merged Mining, although it may not be the most practical solution. He also provides a link to more details about the perpetual one-way peg mechanism needed to pay for fees without introducing speculation. On a related note, someone else suggested that blockchains are not ideal for this purpose because they do not want it to cost money to use the bulletin board. Instead, they recommended looking into FMS, which combines Usenet/mailing lists with a web of trust for spam resistance.</p>
