    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev group, AdamISZ, posted a message asking for opinions and critiques on an idea he had for "bitcoin fungibility markets," which could apply to scenarios where there is a market for liquidity and privacy is a high priority. He provided a gist with an outline of his idea, which was mainly intended for joinmarket but could be used for other purposes as well. However, Greg Maxwell pointed out a flaw in the idea, which involved the potential for makers to falsely claim censorship after not sending the plaintext. Upon further reflection, Waxwing (presumably the author of the post) acknowledged that this problem was more difficult than anticipated, and any potential solutions would likely require much more sophisticated ideas. Many current solutions rely on presuming the existence of an uncensorable blockchain bulletin board or using the blockchain for that function, which is too slow and expensive.</p>
