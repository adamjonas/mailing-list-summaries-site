    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to remove the 'proprietary' and 'proof-of-reserves' types from the PSBT specifications, as they have nothing to do with the intrinsic operations required to finalize a valid transaction from PSBT manipulation. While some may include proprietary information in the PSBT, any PSBT software supporting unknown data can also keep such proprietary information and it can be retrieved without issue. Therefore, there is no need for a PSBT implementation to provide explicit support for these types, and the evidence of all PSBT implementations not implementing them further reinforces this conclusion. It is common practice to set aside one or more "version slots" for proprietary usage so that people adding their own features don't use the official BIP version. As a BIP174 library, one does not have to add logic to "support" those versions, just treat them as unknown. The only people who will need to worry about the logic of parsing and encoding those versions are apps that utilize them.</p>
