    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the attached gist has proposed an outline for an idea that can be applied to scenarios where there is a market for liquidity and privacy is a high priority, such as Bitcoin fungibility markets. The proposal aims to make selective censorship difficult using cryptographic blinding and a proof-of-misbehavior approach. The design is not specific to CoinJoin and would work similarly for other bitcoin-native systems where the concept of a "liquidity maker" applies. The proposed model would allow Joinmarket or similar systems to run on a single bulletin board server with reduced resource requirements. The current redundancy model used in Joinmarket, which relies on 2-3 independent IRC servers, has limitations due to the possibility of collusion among servers to selectively censor participants. The proposed design aims to disincentivize censorship and make it difficult to achieve.</p>
