    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread starts with Thiago reporting an issue with the 'listaccounts' command in bitcoind. He noticed that his default account was missing from the output of this command. Thiago also shared some other commands and their outputs, such as 'getinfo,' 'getaccountaddress,' and 'listaccounts.' Michael Grønager, the creator of libcoin, responded to Thiago's email suggesting that he needed to set up a username/password for accessing commands that require authentication. Michael also advised Thiago to upgrade the libboost-dev-all package from version 1.42.0 to 1.46.1.In a separate email thread, Thiago reported an error while compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04. The configure script worked fine, but make failed to compile the code due to some undefined reference errors. Michael suggested upgrading libboost-dev-all to resolve this problem.The email thread discusses the release of "libcoin," a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. According to Michael, the libcoin/bitcoind client is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client and is capable of downloading the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The functionalities in the Satoshi client have been encapsulated, globals removed, and moved from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3.Michael Gronager, PhD, Director of Ceptacle, announces the release of the first version of the libcoin crypto currency library. He can be reached at gronager@ceptacle.com, and more information about libcoin can be found on <a href="http://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin/wiki">http://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin/wiki</a>.</p>
