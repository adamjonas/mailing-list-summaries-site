    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer, Michael Gronager has raised an issue with the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 13. He attempted to implement a bitfield-based parsing of the version byte using the description he got from Luke-jr and discovered that it did not hold. According to him, there is no logic in the definitions in base58.h for network classes, which are not consistent with the ones in the BIP-13. Gronager requested help from Gavin Andresen and Luke-jr to resolve the disparity. He also suggested discussions should take place at one place – at the Bitcoin-dev mailing list instead of being spread across different threads on Bitcointalk or solely on IRC. In response, Andresen pointed out that Gronager's idea would not work as it could allow an attacker to create single/multisig address collisions, which counts as a major flaw.</p>
