    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, has been testing how the Bitcoin-Qt GUI deals with multisignature transactions. He discovered that it can display them without any issues. However, it doesn't support sending multisig/BIP16 transactions as it is not yet ready for the main network. Gavin sees two possible paths: 1) Leave the GUI as-is and require multisig testing to use the RPC interface or 2) Start implementing multisig support in the GUI during the 0.6 release process but only enable it for the test network. The advantage of path one is that it should mean 0.6 gets to final release faster, whereas the advantage of path two is more testing of multisig with fewer bug reports. Gavin suggests allowing "send-to-multisig-address" via the GUI, which should be an easy change to the address validation logic. However, creating multisig addresses via the GUI should wait until the next release.</p>
