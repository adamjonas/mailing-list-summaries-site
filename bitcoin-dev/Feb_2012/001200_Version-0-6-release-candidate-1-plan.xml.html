    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 6, 2012, Gavin Andresen wrote that there were several major changes in git HEAD that are ready for wider testing. He stated that the best way of getting lots of testing is to release binaries and he planned to pull together a release candidate in the next day or two. Several other pull requests seemed to be well-tested and have been part of next-test for a while. These include coinbaser (719), rpc_keepalive (568), optimize_FastGetWork (565), bugfix_client_name (715), and optimize_ToHex (562). Andresen mentioned that if the changes seem too much to add onto 0.6, they could wait for version 0.7. He also discussed a modification for transactions with extra data in scriptSig to make them non-standard, which could significantly harm the ability to replace the current spammy "green address" scheme with a sensible extra signature system. On the miner end, it could significantly harm adoption of such a system. Lastly, Andresen expressed interest in pulling a modified version of 755, which would not vote for /P2SH/ unless -p2sh specified. However, he did not mention what else needed to be changed for this. Additionally, he wanted to pull 787, which involved CAddrMan: stochastic address manager, but it did not pass his sanity tests. He confirmed seeing at least one addr.db corruption with this.</p>
