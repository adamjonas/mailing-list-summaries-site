    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, various developers and users have provided opinions and suggestions related to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) 20 and 21. There were debates on the use of delimiters in URI schemes, backward compatibility, and adding a field for expiration time for merchants.Some participants proposed changes to BIP 21 to make it compatible with existing web standards. Others suggested using a shorter prefix instead of "mustimplement" to keep URL sizes small. The send private key feature was removed from the original spec. A developer named Matt defended minor changes to the draft and argued against changing the name of the message parameter in BIP 21.Matt Corallo proposed changes to the methods for forward compatibility in BIP 21. New variables will be added either as-is or with a mustimplement: prefix, so if a client does not know what the variable is that is after mustimplement:, it should consider the entire URI invalid and either notify the user or just drop it silently. This way, things like expiretime can be added without worrying about old clients ignoring the field. However, this is not an ideal solution as depending on the names of variables to provide information is ugly.In regards to the expiretime field being implemented now, Matt thinks it is inappropriate because some clients already have an old implementation, and the possibility of it getting ignored is too large. The BIP states that "It is recommended that additional variables prefixed with mustimplement: not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6 months from the finalization of this BIP has passed in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade."Gary Rowe suggested that one never uses doubles or floats for money. However, many people do. If you place a sell order on mtgox for $999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 per BTC, it actually stores the awesome doublemax trade it actually stores for you.Slush suggested using satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin, but Matt thinks that's a mixed bag of worms. If they make it use satoshis, people who are working with things at COIN scale are inevitably going to end up multiplying numbers stored as radix-2 floating point to get satoshis and then are going to be confused when it comes out "wrong". Using decimal numbers at least lets them treat the values as strings and avoid arithmetic that will end up confusing them.</p>
