    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion about BIP 21, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, various suggestions were made to improve the proposal. One suggestion was to change the "mustimplement" prefix to "req" for better backward compatibility. Another suggestion was to use an abbreviated prefix for smaller URL sizes in QR codes. The idea of adding a time-to-expire field for merchants was also brought up. Furthermore, there was a debate on whether or not to change the decimal numbers used in BIP 20 to conform with HTML and URI standards. One member suggested that BIP 21 be rejected, but the group ultimately agreed to make minor changes to the draft. There was also a discussion about the "message" parameter in the proposal and whether it should be renamed to "description." Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, made changes to the methods for forward compatibility in BIP 21. New variables will be added either as-is or with a mustimplement: prefix, instead of a version number. If the client does not know what the variable is after mustimplement:, it should consider the entire URI invalid and drop it silently. This method allows things like expiretime to be added without worrying about old clients ignoring the field. However, it may not be an ideal solution. Matt suggests that if anyone has a better idea on how to do backward compatibility, please suggest it.According to the latest BIP, additional variables prefixed with mustimplement: should not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of six months from the finalization of this BIP has passed, in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade. Matt reiterated that he wants to keep the list of changes from the Bitcoin-Qt implementation to this BIP very minimal at the late stage of the 0.6 release cycle. Amir Taaki, another Bitcoin developer, proposed rejecting BIP 20 and re-submitting a new standard, considering BIP 20 is incompatible with almost every standard on the web.Matt Corallo responded by saying that the send private key was not in the original spec, is not implemented anywhere, and should have been removed as part of the BIP 21 copy/paste. It is now gone. Gary Rowe suggested that one never uses doubles or floats for money. Matt countered that lots of people do and gave an example of placing a sell order on mtgox for "$999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 per BTC."Slush proposed using satoshis instead of decimal Bitcoin, but Matt argued that using decimal numbers at least lets them treat the values as strings and avoid arithmetic that will end up confusing them.</p>
