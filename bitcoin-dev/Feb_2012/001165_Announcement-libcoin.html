    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ceptacle has announced the release of its first version of a crypto currency library called "libcoin" based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin is a chain agnostic, 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client that downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The functionalities of Satoshi client code have been completely refactored in libcoin by properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach, dividing functionalities into logical units and libraries and minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients. This makes it easier to extend without touching the basic bitcoin source files. All chain specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain) in libcoin, hence experiments with chain settings, mining, security and digital currencies for research and educational purposes are easily accessible.The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Libcoin has LGPL v. 3 license which means it can be used in open source as well as in commercial projects, but improvements should go back into the libcoin library. Michael Gronager, Director of Ceptacle, shared this news with Bitcoiners via email and also extended an invitation to join libcoin on Twitter. He thanked everyone and provided his contact details for any help. A link to download "libcoin Satoshi release" was also provided in the email along with links to read more about libcoin on GitHub. Wladimir asked if there were any plans for porting over bitcoin-qt to which Michael replied that he had not looked much at qt and help would be appreciated.</p>
