    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new application named "coinexplorer" has been uploaded to libcoin by Michael Gronager, the Director of Ceptacle. The application enables queries similar to that of blockexplorer.com, but locally on your own chain. Coinexplorer uses the HTTP GET feature of the coinHTTP/Server class to enable a simple search webpage for block searches. The application builds on a new library addition called coinStat which is a collection of classes for gathering and querying the block chain for other information than the ones used directly by the Node.The users can do block searches either by command line or by simply pointing their browsers at <a href="http://localhost:8332">http://localhost:8332</a>. However, Michael apologizes for the rudimentary interface as he is not really javascript/html5 savvy. He left a more modern interface as an exercise for those who are. Coinexplorer can be found in the latest git at <a href="https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin">https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin</a>.</p>
