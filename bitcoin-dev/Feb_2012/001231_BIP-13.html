    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 20, 2012, Michael Gr√∏nager posted a message on the BIP-13 discussion wiki suggesting that the "version" portion of the Bitcoin address be labeled as the "network id" to indicate which network and chain the address is intended for. However, another user pointed out that it has always been referred to as the "version" and that the details of the bits were discussed in the past. The original intention for the label was also confirmed to be "version" according to Satoshi's reference implementation. It was noted that BIP 13 had not been disputed much and was only held back by BIP 16/17.</p>
