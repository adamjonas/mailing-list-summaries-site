    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In February 2012, Gregory Maxwell reported that the Bitcoin library, libbitcoin, only made it to height 138k in terms of synchronization. He noted that this was likely due to the fact that most of the time is spent late in the chain and therefore this level wasn't very far along. Maxwell estimated that it would take libbitcoin three to four times longer to complete the process.As it turned out, libbitcoin ended up taking almost exactly twice as long as expected to reach the desired synchronization point.</p>
