    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Gronager, a director at Ceptacle, was trying to redo the performance test of the libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client that had received improvements in speed since 0.4.0. However, he couldn't find v0.5.2 tag on Github. Aidan Thornton suggested that the tag might be in a different repository and some developer politics might have been involved. Michael also asked about adding new checkpoints and wondered if there was any policy or logic behind it. He mentioned that the number could easily be bumped to 160000 by now.</p>
