    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a 2012 conversation on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Luke-Jr asked if a proposed rule change had been verified to make complicated transaction-based versions impossible. Responding to this query, Pieter Wuille confirmed that the change had been tested on testnet against a patched node. Wuille also proposed adding the rule directly to the protocol rules, rather than implementing a two-step process of preferring blocks that don't break the rule first. This is because the latter approach would increase the size of the patch and require backporting the discouragement-system to older versions of the software. The current proposal, however, only requires six lines of code to be added. No consensus was reached on the proposal at the time.</p>
