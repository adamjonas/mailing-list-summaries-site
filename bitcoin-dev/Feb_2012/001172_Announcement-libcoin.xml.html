    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on February 1, 2012, Michael Grønager asked about the Boost version used in a Linux path and requested either version 1.47 or 1.48. He mentioned that signal_sets were handy but would create an alternative scheme. The latest stable version of Boost on Gentoo was identified as version 1.46.1. In regard to versions 0.4 vs 0.5, changes were related to integration of the qt client and some deadlock fixes, which were not necessary for Grønager's needs. However, he agreed to review all changes. It was suggested that it may be easier to merge with the latest 0.4.x branch located at git://gitorious.org/+bitcoin-stable-developers/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable.git.</p>
