    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ceptacle has released the first version of the cryptocurrency library "libcoin" based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client in under 90 minutes on a modern laptop. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been refactored, with classes properly encapsulated and all globals removed. Moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach has been implemented. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries to minimize dependencies for thin clients. Libcoin is chain agnostic, and all chain-specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain), making experiments with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes easily accessible. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3 and can be used in open-source as well as commercial projects. However, improvements should go back into the libcoin library.Thiago is having trouble compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04 due to undefined references in the Script.cpp file. Michael advises that boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0 have a conflict, which can be resolved by upgrading to the 1.46.1 library with sudo apt-get upgrade libboost-dev-all. Martinx has compiled and run Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin, and I0coin from sources on Ubuntu 11.10 after installing dependencies such as libboost1.46-all-dev.Thiago cannot get bitcoind to listen on high ports despite correctly configuring bitcoin.conf and trying rpcport options. When Thiago "strace[s] it," he sees that it always tries to listen at port 8332 rather than the specified port. Michael explains that support for "port" is available on Github now and details the two lines required to incorporate this feature.Finally, Michael explains that HTTP error code 401 indicates permission denied, which means that Thiago needs to set up a username and password in bitcoin.conf or on the command line to access certain commands. Michael, Director of Ceptacle, has provided his contact information, including mobile number, email, and website, for further queries. It is unclear whether the issues with undefined references in CBigNum and Hash function have been resolved or not.</p>
