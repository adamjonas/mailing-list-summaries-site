    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer named Martinx was having trouble compiling libcoin on his Ubuntu 11.04 machine and reached out to Michael Gronager, the director of Ceptacle, for help. Michael responded that he had no issue compiling it on his Ubuntu 11.10 machine, and suggested that the problem might be related to Boost 1.48.1. He also recommended that Martinx try compiling on a cleaner machine. Michael introduced Libcoin as a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client, along with a fully compatible drop-in replacement for the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for e.g. thin clients. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3.
