    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ceptacle, a research and development company, announced the release of its crypto currency library called "libcoin." The library is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client code which has been completely refactored to properly encapsulate classes, remove all globals, move from threads and mutexes, and minimize dependencies. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. It is also chain agnostic, maintaining all chain specific settings from a single class making it easy to experiment with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, meaning that it can be used in open source as well as commercial projects but improvements should go back into the libcoin library.</p>
