    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 2, 2012, Michael Gr√∏nager sent out an email requesting for a test and feedback. The problem was discovered to be the use of static libraries instead of shared ones, which is best practice, except for specific scenarios like universal "Linux" binaries. It was also noted that most distros do not come with static libraries installed by default. CoinQt stuff was also causing issues. Nonetheless, a patch was created to fix the issue. The patch involved commenting out the lines that set Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS and QT4_FOUND in the CMakeLists.txt files. These lines were replaced with the # symbol to comment them out.</p>
