    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user reached out to Michael Grønager expressing gratitude for libcoin and shared their difficulties with compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04. They had successfully compiled and run Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin, and I0coin on their machine but were encountering error messages after trying to configure and make the file for libcoin. In response, Michael suggested upgrading the library to version 1.46.1 since there was a conflict between boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0. The solution involved running 'sudo apt-get upgrade libboost-dev-all.' Michael explained that libcoin is a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client and is now ready for its first release. Libcoin maintains a version of bitcoind that is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client and downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The library is chain agnostic and supports experiments with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3.Michael's contact information is included in the context, which includes his mobile phone number, email address, and website. The context also advertises LearnDevNow!, an online learning library for Microsoft developers, with a promotional subscription price of $99.99 and a list of topics covered. Finally, there is information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list, including a link to subscribe.</p>
