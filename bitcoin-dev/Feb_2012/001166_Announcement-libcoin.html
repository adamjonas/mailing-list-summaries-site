    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ceptacle has announced the release of the first version of its cryptocurrency library "libcoin" that is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin is a crypto currency library that maintains a version of bitcoind that can be used on the same computer on the same files and you can call it with the same scripts, as well as easily extend it without touching the basic bitcoin source files. In libcoin, the Satoshi client code has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes, removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Libcoin is chain agnostic, meaning all chain specific settings are maintained in a single class (Chain), and hence experiments with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes are easily accessible. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3 that allows using it in open source as well as in commercial projects. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, which is less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The bitcoin project should be split into a library, with a prototype client and the actual clients, according to Michael Gronager, Director of Ceptacle. He also added, "This way I had a working version running each day while doing the refactoring - with my wallet at stake!"
