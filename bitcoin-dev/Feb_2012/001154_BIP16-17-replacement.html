    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 31, 2012, Gregory Maxwell responded to a proposal with arguments that nodes in Bitcoin did not need to trust the network and could validate information themselves. He argued that it was important not to make breaking changes to the system because it was a zero-trust system and any change would require a client update. Two proposals, BIP16/17, were not considered breaking changes according to Maxwell, but the author of the original proposal felt that they were. Regardless, he agreed that making such changes would be difficult given the resources required. In conclusion, the most reasonable solution would be to increase the version number of the transaction structure so that it indicates that they are being processed differently from old transactions.</p>
