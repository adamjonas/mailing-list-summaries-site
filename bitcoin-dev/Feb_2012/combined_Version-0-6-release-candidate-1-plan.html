        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The problem of green addresses spamming the blockchain can be addressed through a REST-ful API provided by green address providers. This API allows users to declare transactions as "green" by providing their transaction ID and credentials. Users can also check whether a transaction has been declared green by providing its ID and receiving a boolean response. However, Gavin Andresen believes that any design relying on clients recognizing two variations of a transaction is not a good idea.Luke-Jr initially raised concerns about making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard on February 6, 2012. He was worried that this change could hinder the replacement of the current spammy "green address" scheme with a more sensible extra signature system. Luke-Jr also pointed out that it could negatively impact the adoption of such a system by miners. However, gmaxwell explained why this change was no longer necessary on IRC, leading Luke-Jr to withdraw his objection on February 7, 2012.In his proposal on the same day, Luke-Jr suggested making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard. He expressed concern that this change could hinder the replacement of the current spammy "green address" scheme with a more sensible extra signature system. He also noted that it could significantly affect the adoption of such a system by miners. Luke-Jr questioned why the possibility of using an extra signature for non-blockchain-spam 0-confirmation transactions was being ignored. MtGox reportedly supported this plan. He asked if there was an alternative solution to the problem of green addresses spamming the blockchain. In his pull request, he proposed that stripping extra data would not have any negative impact on normal transactions, and clients creating these transactions could be written to expect the transaction ID to change or not care about it.On February 6, 2012, Gavin Andresen announced several major changes in git HEAD that were ready for wider testing. He mentioned that the best way to get extensive testing is to release binaries, and he planned to create a release candidate within the next day or two. Several pull requests, such as coinbaser (719), rpc_keepalive (568), optimize_FastGetWork (565), bugfix_client_name (715), and optimize_ToHex (562), seemed well-tested and had been part of next-test for a while. Andresen suggested that if these changes seemed too significant to add to version 0.6, they could be included in version 0.7. He also discussed a modification for making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard, highlighting that it could significantly hinder the replacement of the current spammy "green address" scheme with a more sensible extra signature system. On the miner end, it could also affect the adoption of such a system. Additionally, Andresen expressed interest in including a modified version of 755, which would not vote for /P2SH/ unless -p2sh was specified. However, he did not mention what other changes were required for this. Furthermore, he wanted to pull request 787, involving CAddrMan: stochastic address manager, but it did not pass his sanity tests. He confirmed encountering at least one addr.db corruption related to this.In summary, the head of Git has announced several major changes ready for wider testing. A release candidate will be created in the next day or two, with the goal of having a month of review and testing before releasing version 0.6 with zero High Priority bugs. The proposed TODO list for the release candidate includes bug fixes, displaying multiple outputs in the GUI, and making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard. Additionally, a modified version of fixing minimize to tray and not voting for /P2SH/ unless -p2sh specified will be included. The discussion thread will cover thoughts on introducing higher-level multisignature support.</p>
