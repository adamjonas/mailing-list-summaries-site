    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thiago attempted to run "bitcoind" from libcoin sources with an empty ~/.bitcoin directory. He was successful in running it on Terminal 1 and checking the version, blocks, connections, difficulty, and testnet status on Terminal 2 using the command 'bitcoind getinfo'. However, he encountered HTTP error code 404 and JSON RPC Error code -36001 when trying other commands such as 'help', 'getaccountaddress', and 'listaccounts'. Seeking advice for this issue, Martinx - ジェームズ confirmed that he could compile libcoin at his Ubuntu 11.10 by installing libboost1.46-all-dev alongside other dependencies.Michael Grønager provided further advice, stating that boost 1.42 and openssl 1.0 have a conflict, so Thiago should upgrade the libboost-dev-all library to 1.46.1. Additionally, Martinx - ジェームズ encountered an undefined reference error while running make when compiling libcoin under his Ubuntu 11.04. Michael Grønager suggested some solutions, including verifying the installation of all dependencies and upgrading the libboost-dev-all library. In addition, Michael Grønager announced the release of the crypto currency library "libcoin," which is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client is a 100% compatible drop-in replacement of the bitcoin/bitcoind client and downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. Libcoin refactors the Satoshi client code completely, properly encapsulating classes and removing all globals, moving from threads and mutexes to a pure asynchronous approach. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries.Libcoin is a chain agnostic library that allows for easy experimentation with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies. It supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows with a build system based on CMake. Libcoin can be used in both open source and commercial projects under the LGPL v. 3 license, but improvements should go back into the library. The library is available for download as the "libcoin Satoshi release" from Github. More information on libcoin can be found on their Twitter page and their Github wiki.At the end of the message, Michael Gronager, PhD, Director of Ceptacle, provides his contact information.</p>
