    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 14, 2012, Gavin Andresen sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list announcing an IRC meeting to discuss the progress towards 50% hashing power for BIP 16 support, a protocol change coming up on February 20, and the duplicate coinbase issue. The meeting was scheduled for February 14 at 21:00 UTC on #bitcoin-dev on Freenode IRC. Slush questioned whether it was a good idea to have a meeting on Valentine's Day, to which Wladimir replied that his girlfriend hates Valentine's Day, so it was okay with him. In jest, Gavin suggested that after discussing tech, they could all send each other bitcoins with addresses that are cute Valentine's Day messages. The email also included an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers, priced at $99.99.</p>
