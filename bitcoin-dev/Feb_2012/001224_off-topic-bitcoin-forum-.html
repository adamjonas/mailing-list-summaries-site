    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from February 19, 2012, Michael Gr√∏nager expressed frustration with the requirement of five posts and four hours in order to post on a forum. He mentioned that this policy was strange and that he would apply for whitelisting. Wladimir responded, explaining that the policy was instated during busier times when new users would frequently ask questions that had already been answered. The policy forces users to spend time in the newbie forums before being able to post in the full forum. However, Wladimir noted that the policy is not as strict as it used to be and Michael should have no trouble getting whitelisted.</p>
