    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A comparison between the libcoin/bitcoind and bitcoin/bitcoind clients found that the former is able to download the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. However, it was suggested that this speedup may have been due to the removal of the secure allocator and subsequent fixing of the mlock performance bug, which can make a significant difference on some systems. Despite this, the libbitcoin client was only able to reach height 138k in the same time it takes for the reference client to fully sync. This is potentially because the ECDSA checks are CPU bound in libbitcoin, whereas they are skipped in bitcoin up to the highest hardcoded checkpoint. The rpc performance of libbitcoin is said to be superior, but there is still a longstanding pull request for async rpc for the reference client that has yet to be merged.</p>
