    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2012, a user named grarpamp started a low-volume Google Group mailing list called bitcoin-discussion. Unfortunately, the group appeared to be as dead as the one on SourceForge. Grarpamp suggested that a real mailing list for users needs to exist and it should house a more technical crowd than forums which are magnets for initiates. In addition, since there were many client adherents to the same Bitcoin specification, the original bitcoin-list at lists.sourceforge.net may not be the place to hold talk of all the adherent clients. Grarpamp suggested that they could change the charter of the unused list and do whatever they wanted with it because people who matter would probably not object. They also pointed out that the SourceForge list browsing interface is ridiculously lame and overweight, and it doesn't appear to be setting a '^Reply-to: ' header which is bad. Googlegroups would be an okay site or a pure MailMan interface would be even better and more customarily accepted.For the user list, Grarpamp suggests searching to make sure there's not already a busy list out there somewhere and checking the list aggregator sites like markmail, gmane, etc too. They also recommend chartering it as Bitcoin protocol, client agnostic, finding an impartial administrative and robust home for the list with browsable, searchable, and downloadable archives, making the announcement to other known client lists/forums, closing any relevant old lists, and promoting via similar announcements from time to time.Grarpamp created bitcoin-discussion on Google Groups because it was free and easily available and easy to set up. They are not attached to this particular list, but whatever happens, they hope that there will be more people willing to share administrative duties. The charter can be changed if needed, and the creator/maintainer, that being Grarpamp, is generally known to be a pretty decent guy.</p>
