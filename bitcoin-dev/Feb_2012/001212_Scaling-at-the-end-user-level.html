    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the possibility of distributing a weekly precomputed bootstrap chain for Bitcoin. The options proposed for distribution include rsync and db_dump > git > db_load. While there is over 50% compression available in the index and chain, some people fear that this approach runs contrary to the distributed nature of Bitcoin. One proposal suggests using Git repos backed by strong hashes, with each commit representing a single block dump. Trusted entities such as pools could sign at checkpoints/heights. Blockchain tools would need to be developed to take blk* and export single blocks, process/export up to a certain block, and quit. Everyone would compare and sign a commit hash, and everyone else would do git pulls. The development of blockchain tools is crucial for this approach.A suggestion is made to use one of the thin clients on older computers. However, if not validating the chain means not caring about the history, it may not be appropriate to only make new transactions with a new key post-installation time and validate new transactions as they come in. Further investigation is required. Torrents are also suggested as a possible distribution method, as they are strongly hashed and can be signed.</p>
