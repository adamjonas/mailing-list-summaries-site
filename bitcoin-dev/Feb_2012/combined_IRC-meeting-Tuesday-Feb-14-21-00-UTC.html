        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 14, 2012, Gavin Andresen sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list inviting members to an IRC meeting on #bitcoin-dev on Freenode IRC. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the progress towards 50% hashing power for BIP 16 support, a protocol change scheduled for February 20, and the duplicate coinbase issue. The meeting was scheduled for February 14 at 21:00 UTC. However, one member named Slush expressed concern about having the meeting on Valentine's Day, as some members had girlfriends. In response, Wladimir stated that his girlfriend hates Valentine's Day, so it was acceptable for him. Gavin jokingly suggested that after discussing technical matters, they could exchange bitcoins with addresses containing cute Valentine's Day messages.In addition to the meeting invitation, Gavin also included an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers priced at $99.99.Overall, Gavin Andresen invited members of the Bitcoin development mailing list to a meeting to discuss various topics, including the status of BIP 16 support and a protocol change scheduled for February 20. The meeting was planned for February 14 at 21:00 UTC, although there were concerns about its timing conflicting with Valentine's Day. Gavin responded humorously to these concerns and proposed exchanging bitcoins with Valentine's Day-themed addresses.</p>
