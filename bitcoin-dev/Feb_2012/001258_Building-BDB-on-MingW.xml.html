    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki reached out to Wladimir for help with an issue he was facing while following the instructions from build-msw.txt. Amir provided a link to a forum post on Bitcointalk that described his issue, but the proposed fix in that thread did not work for him. It is unclear what the specific issue was or whether Wladimir was able to provide any assistance. Additionally, a link to a thread on the Oracle forums was included in the email, although it is unclear how it relates to Amir's issue.</p>
