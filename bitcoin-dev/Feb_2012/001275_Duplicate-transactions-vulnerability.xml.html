    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to an unknown recipient, Zooko asks for an explanation of an attack that he assumes requires "malice energy" to perform. He admits to having "niceness energy" and not being able to figure it out himself. He requests the person who has knowledge of the attack to share it with him privately if it is too dangerous to post publicly. In addition, Zooko mentions discovering cases of slightly bad handling of merkle trees in the code (v0.4) but never reported them. He suggests that his discoveries might interact with the one under discussion. He plans to explain what he found within a week. Zooko also confirms that he showed it to other people who helped him determine that it was not exploitable.</p>
