    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2012, Brautigam RÃ³bert suggested adding a protocol rule to prevent blocks from containing a transaction whose hash is equal to that of a former transaction which has not yet been completely spent. However, Pieter argued that such a rule would prevent pruning and instead proposed the rule to be "Do not allow blocks to contain transaction hashes which are already present in that branch." Pieter also clarified that duplicate transactions should not happen by accident but are possible through badly written software or malicious intent, particularly with coinbase transactions.</p>
