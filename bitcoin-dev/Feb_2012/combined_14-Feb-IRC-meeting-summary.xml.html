        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 14, 2012, the Bitcoin community discussed three important issues. Firstly, they talked about BIP 16 support, which was at about 34% of hashing power. The group decided to continue asking big pools and miners to upgrade and will re-evaluate support on March 1st with a potential switchover date if there is enough support on March 15th.Secondly, they discussed changes to the protocol that would include checksums on the initial version messages, with an 'addrFrom' field including IP addresses. This change was made to address reports of NAT routers changing the contents of packets. A patch that puts the outside-the-NAT IP address in addrFrom will be released, and an alert will be sent next Friday directing people to a bitcoin.org/feb20 web page explaining the issue.Finally, the group discussed how to deal with potential chain-splitting attacks involving duplicate coinbase transactions. The consensus was that requiring the first four bytes of every coinbase to be the block height is the best solution in the long term. However, in the short term, the plan is to discourage blocks with duplicate coinbases. The final version of bitcoin-qt/bitcoind version 0.6 will place the block height into coinbases it creates.</p>
