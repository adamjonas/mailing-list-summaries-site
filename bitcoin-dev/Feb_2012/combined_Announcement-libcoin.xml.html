    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Grønager claimed on Wed, Feb 1, 2012, that the libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client in less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. However, some people believe that the speedup was almost solely due to the removal of the secure allocator and fixing of the mlock performance bug. Pieter expressed concern that the query code does not operate on a const copy of the blockchain structure, while Gregory Maxwell reported that libcoin took twice as long to sync as the bitcoin reference client. Michael Grønager claims that the RPC server in libcoin is much faster than in the Satoshi client because all query methods access the blockchain as a const object, which allows for safe querying without intervening with the Node thread. SendTo methods first query if a transaction can take place, then push it to the work-queue of the Node thread and exit immediately until the Node has finished its current tasks. There is contention during sync, but lock profiling shows little contention. Finally, some users believe that the big speedup is not typical for straight refactors that do not change data structures.</p>
