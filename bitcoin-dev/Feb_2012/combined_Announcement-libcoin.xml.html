    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Michael Grønager claimed that the libcoin/bitcoind client can download the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, which takes less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. However, Gregory Maxwell speculated that the speedup was due to removing the secure allocator and fixing the mlock performance bug. He also reported that libbitcoin was slower in syncing than the reference client. Maxwell suspected that the reason for this was because libbitcoin is CPU bound on ECDSA checks, which are skipped in bitcoin in blocks up to the highest hardcoded checkpoint. Additionally, Michael Grønager claimed that the RPC server in libcoin was much faster compared to the Satoshi client. He noted that the Satoshi client HTTP server executes all rpc commands in its own thread, but to do so, it needs to stop the thread of the Node. As a result, two threads block each other, resulting in longer waiting times. In contrast, in libcoin, all query methods access the blockchain as a const object and can safely query it without intervening with the Node thread's work. Nonetheless, Pieter, another user, questioned the safety of removing the locking altogether. Gregory Maxwell later reported that libbitcoin took almost exactly twice as long as the reference client to sync. Lastly, Michael Grønager commented on the significant speedup of the libcoin/bitcoind client, which he attributed to the RPC server being blistering fast compared to the Satoshi client.</p>
