    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The head of Git has announced that there are several major changes ready for wider testing. A release candidate is going to be pulled together in the next day or two, with the goal of having at least a full month of release candidate review and testing before releasing a 0.6 final version with zero High Priority bugs. The proposed TODO list for rc1 includes bug fixes, displaying multiple outputs in GUI and making transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard. A modified version of fixing minimize to tray and not voting for /P2SH/ unless -p2sh specified will also be pulled. CAddrMan: stochastic address manager was not included due to it not passing sanity tests. The discussion thread will include thoughts on rolling out higher-level multisignature support.</p>
