    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Michael and Thiago is centered on starting libcoin's bitcoind using high ports. Thiago sets the desired rpcport and port in the bitcoin.conf file, but the bitcoind still attempts to listen at 8332, causing a bind operation failure due to an Address already in use error. Despite trying to start bitcoind with the rpcport option, it still doesn't work. Michael advises Thiago to set up a username/password either on the command line or in the bitcoin.conf file to access some commands. Authenticated methods require an auth parameter, and HTTP error code 401 indicates permission denied. He suggests checking the bitcoind.cpp file for commands that can be used with or without authentication.In another email thread, Martinx thanks Michael for creating libcoin. However, he cannot compile libcoin under his Ubuntu 11.04 operating system. When Martinx runs 'make,' it returns an error message in the end. Michael recommends doing a sudo apt-get upgrade libboost-dev-all to get the 1.46.1 library.Ceptacle, a Danish company, has released the first version of libcoin, a cryptocurrency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin "Satoshi" client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. The Satoshi client code has been completely refactored in libcoin, encapsulating classes properly, removing all globals, and moving to a pure asynchronous approach from threads and mutexes. Functionalities have been divided into logical units and libraries, minimizing dependencies for thin clients. Libcoin is chain agnostic and supports experimenting with chain settings, mining, security, and digital currencies for research and educational purposes. The build system of libcoin is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, allowing its use in open source as well as in commercial projects. However, any improvements should go back into the libcoin library. More information about libcoin can be found on the libcoin GitHub wiki and Twitter.</p>
