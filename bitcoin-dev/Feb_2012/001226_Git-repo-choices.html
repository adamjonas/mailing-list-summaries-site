    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The user is seeking clarification on the intended use of three different repositories related to Bitcoin. They express confusion about which repository is best suited for their needs, and note that the descriptions provided on each repository are minimal with the exception of #1. The first repository (#1) is identified as the current development tree, but the user notes that it may not always be reliable or usable. The second repository (#2) is described as a copy of some portion of #1 that has been discontinued around version 0.4.0. Its purpose is similar to #3, which is another copy of #1 that is intended for development along stable branches and making release cuts from the same. Releases that are made from #3 are then pulled back to #1 for keeping. Finally, the user expresses confusion about why a certain function is not included in #1.</p>
