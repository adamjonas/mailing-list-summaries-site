    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 20th, the bitcoin 0.2 protocol which had no checksums on version/verack was terminated. As a result of forgetting to add the date check in libcoin, there may have been some errors in the log file after that date and users could have had difficulty obtaining blocks. However, the code has since been fixed.Updates for the 0.6 protocol include new internal address classes: PubKeyHash and ScriptHash to support P2SH. Additionally, a lot of other code from the 0.6 branch has been adapted. Support for BitcoinQt is also being ported to use libcoin which required a couple of interface enhancements.Further details on the updates can be found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin/commit/98531e971152d4fff41c30b14d58b9fd548b21db">https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoin/commit/98531e971152d4fff41c30b14d58b9fd548b21db</a>.</p>
