    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Gavin Andresen invited members of the Bitcoin development mailing list to a meeting to discuss several topics, including the status of BIP 16 support and a protocol change that was scheduled for February 20. The meeting was planned for February 14 at 21:00 UTC on #bitcoin-dev on Freenode IRC. However, one member named Slush expressed concern that the timing of the meeting conflicted with Valentine's Day and that some members had girlfriends. Gavin responded with humor, suggesting that after the technical discussion, members could send each other bitcoins with addresses containing cute Valentine's Day messages. In addition to the meeting invitation, Gavin included a promotional message for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers.</p>
