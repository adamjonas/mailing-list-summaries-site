        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>One suggestion to attract a great Windows developer is to utilize free advertising on StackOverflow for open source projects. The idea is to specifically target Windows developers through this platform. A link provided leads to a meta StackOverflow post discussing open source advertising for sidebar 1H 2012. The poster believes that with some help from the forum, it should not be difficult to get 30 votes for the advertising.Gavin Andresen, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, made an announcement on the #bitcoin-development IRC channel about an upcoming Tuesday IRC meeting. The meeting will cover various topics, including the duplicate coinbase attack/fix and the strategy for rolling out sipa's fix. The participants will also discuss the 0.6 release schedule and potential solutions to attract a talented Windows developer who can address ongoing issues. Additionally, the meeting will touch upon the next steps for multisignature and provide updates on who is currently working on what.</p>
