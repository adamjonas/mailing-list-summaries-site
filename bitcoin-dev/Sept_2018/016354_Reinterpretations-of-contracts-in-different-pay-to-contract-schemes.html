    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The possibility of issues arising when different pay-to-contract schemes are used on Bitcoin has been raised by ZmnSCPxj. The concern is that the byte serialization of a contract under one scheme could be reinterpreted as the byte serialization of a different contract under a different scheme. This could mean that users may commit to a contract under one scheme, but unknowingly commit to a different contract under another scheme. If an independent protocol uses pay-to-contract, it may be possible for the contract to be reinterpreted as a Bitcoin SCRIPT under Taproot, leading to a contract that can be reinterpreted as a Bitcoin SCRIPT and allowing a Bitcoin-level UTXO to be stolen without knowledge of the private key. ZmnSCPxj suggests using the hash of the contract to avoid this issue, proposing that pay-to-contract schemes should pay to the below tweak:Q = P + SHA256d(P || Scheme || C) * GWhere `Scheme` is 256 bits (32 bytes) scheme identifier. For Taproot, it could be the genesis block ID. Other pay-to-contract schemes must ensure that they use a `Scheme` ID that is different with high probability from other `Scheme` IDs, in order to ensure that reinterpretation of contracts is impossible.</p>
