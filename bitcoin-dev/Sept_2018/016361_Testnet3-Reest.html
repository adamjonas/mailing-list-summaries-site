    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Gregory Maxwell, a developer at Bitcoin core, had previously looked into increasing the size of blockindex objects in memory to accommodate signed testnet mode. However, this approach was not successful as it increased the size of the objects while not in signed testnet mode. An alternative solution proposed by jtimon involved turning one of the fields like the merkel root into a union of its normal value and a pointer to a look-aside block index that is only used in signed block testnet mode.Currently, a new implementation is being worked on which includes a global mapping of block hash to signature that is transparently (de)serialized in the block header. Various ways were explored to add the signature to the actual header without changing its size, but it seemed too invasive to truncate the prevblock/merkleroots. This approach does not differ significantly from the suggested union, but corrections are welcome.The code for this implementation can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/tree/signet">https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/tree/signet</a>. It is expected that jtimon and Jeremy Rubin will also be involved in this project.</p>
