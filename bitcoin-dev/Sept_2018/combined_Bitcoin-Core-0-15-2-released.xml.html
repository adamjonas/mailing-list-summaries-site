        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.15.2 has been released for download via their website or through bittorrent. The new minor version release includes bugfixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are advised to report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub to receive security and update notifications. If running an older version, it is recommended to shut it down before upgrading. When upgrading to version 0.15.0 or higher, the chainstate database will be converted to a new format which may take up to half an hour depending on machine speed. The file format of fee_estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0 causing all fee estimates to be discarded if downgrading from version 0.15 or upgrading to version 0.15. Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0.Notable changes in this version include fixing a denial-of-service vulnerability CVE-2018-17144 exploitable by miners that was discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any vulnerable versions to 0.15.2 or 0.16.3 as soon as possible. Other notable changes include build system fixes, consensus changes, RPC improvements, wallet updates, bitcoin-tx, and tests. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later but is not frequently tested on most other Unix-like systems. The release credits contributors such as fanquake, Jonas Schnelli, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, MeshCollider, Russell Yanofsky, Suhas Daftuar, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Bitcoin Core is a free software project that has been built with contributions from volunteers and developers worldwide.</p>
