    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The importance of attribution in sharing good ideas has been discussed, with credit being the only compensation people receive. However, there have been instances where political attacks have led to withholding of attribution, causing disappointment. This has happened in the Bitcoin space where individuals who were previously walked through an idea in private have presented the same idea as their own without giving any credit to the original developers. Gregory Maxwell has experienced this twice, once with Peter R regarding subchains paper and another time with Justus Ranvier concerning compact fraud proofs. Maxwell has voiced his frustration over this issue and has forwarded the correspondence to the list for posterity because he never received a response from Justus despite complaining directly to him. This issue came up again when V. Buterin published a paper on lite client security that appeared to be unaware of proposals from the Bitcoin community on sampled anti-withholding. The paper cited Justus' writeup as evidence that sampling coded data was not previously considered and as the only example of fraud proofs previously. This resulted in the Bitcoin community's past efforts on fraud proofs being unacknowledged, and they were not aware of the state of the art like anti-withholding.</p>
