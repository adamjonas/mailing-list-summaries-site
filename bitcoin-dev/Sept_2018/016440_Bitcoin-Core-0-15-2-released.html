    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.15.2 has been released and is available for download through their website or through bittorrent. The new minor version release includes various bugfixes, performance improvements, as well as updated translations. Users are advised to report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub to receive security and update notifications. If you are running an older version, it is recommended to shut it down before upgrading. The first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format which may take up to half an hour depending on the speed of your machine. The file format of fee_estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0 causing all fee estimates to be discarded if you downgrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15. Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later but is not frequently tested on most other Unix-like systems.Notable changes in this version include fixing a denial-of-service vulnerability CVE-2018-17144 exploitable by miners that was discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.15.2 or 0.16.3 as soon as possible. Other notable changes include build system fixes, consensus changes, RPC improvements, wallet updates, bitcoin-tx, and tests. The release credits contributors such as fanquake, Jonas Schnelli, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, MeshCollider, Russell Yanofsky, Suhas Daftuar, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Bitcoin Core is a free software project that has been built with contributions from volunteers and developers worldwide.</p>
