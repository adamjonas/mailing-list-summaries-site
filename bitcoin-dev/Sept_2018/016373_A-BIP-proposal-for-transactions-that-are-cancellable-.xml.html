    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Seven months ago, a proposal was made regarding a similar functionality that is being discussed in the current conversation. The details of the previous discussion can be found at <a href="https://github.com/reardencode/bips/blob/reverselocktime/bip-0zzz.mediawiki">https://github.com/reardencode/bips/blob/reverselocktime/bip-0zzz.mediawiki</a>. Gregory Maxwell replied to the current conversation stating that although the proposed functionality has been suggested before, it has been deemed harmful. The existing design of CLTV/CSV was created to make it impossible for a transaction to go from valid to invalid based on time. This is because when a spend goes from valid to invalid, it means that a reorganization will destroy coins regardless of any dishonest actions of the coin's prior owner. Maxwell argues that non-monotone validity events in a coin's recent history function like a recently generated coin, which is a coin that reorgs destroy. Bitcoin addresses this issue with recently generated coins by not permitting their use for 100 blocks. Maxwell has yet to see an argument for a use case for non-monotone validity that still sounds useful once the negative effects are addressed. The email was sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and can be viewed at <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev</a>.</p>
