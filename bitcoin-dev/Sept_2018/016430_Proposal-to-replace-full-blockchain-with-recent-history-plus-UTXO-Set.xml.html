    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dave Scotese shared an idea of relieving full nodes of storing the entire blockchain by using a UTXO set at a certain block height that is recognizable by humans and agreed upon by enough people as valid. He offered $50 worth of bitcoin to anyone who can provide him with a UTXO set from the Bitcoin client so that he can try to make a recognizable checkpoint for the blockchain. He also created a memorable experience using the game of life on block 542322 of the Bitcoin blockchain, which produced an image that he shared on imgur and pastebin. However, the references on both platforms were incorrect, and he clarified that the correct block was 542322. He encouraged more people to run full nodes without the hassle of long wait and loads of storage space in the future when the blockchain has grown to terabytes.</p>
