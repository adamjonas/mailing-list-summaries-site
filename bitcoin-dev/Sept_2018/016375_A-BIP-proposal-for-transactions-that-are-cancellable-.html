    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about a proposal for a new BIP to extend OP_CSV and/or OP_CLTV in order for these to allow and interpret negative values. This way, the ownership of coins can be shared between two parties for a certain period of time after which only one party owns them. The proposed approach avoids introducing reorg-induced invalidity. However, a concern was raised regarding the ability to enforce that the transaction is not used by Alice after the 24-hour timelock, as it requires Bob to check the Blockchain in case he needs to publish a proof-of-fraud and add extra funds to the transaction to account for penalization. An alternative approach suggested by Matt Corallo involves multisig option with a locktime pre-signed transaction which is broadcastable at the 24h mark and has different spendability. The proposal is still under discussion and a BIP is being prepared. A paper discussing the proposal can be found here: <a href="https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-01867357">https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-01867357</a>.</p>
