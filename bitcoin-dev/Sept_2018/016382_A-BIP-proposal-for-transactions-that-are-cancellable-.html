    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa expresses an interest in studying the possibility of cancellation of Bitcoin transactions from the user's point of view. He suggests a model for user-agents and quantifies the possible satisfaction that the user can obtain while also quantifying a possible greater satisfaction with respect to the current situation. The author acknowledges that similar proposals have been made before but emphasizes the usefulness of such studies in concluding on opportunities for future developments. Brandon Smith responds to the proposal, arguing that any proposal to change the current mechanism must ensure that existing wallets and users are not vulnerable to being scammed by malicious actors sending low fee expiring transactions. He suggests other approaches like Lightning, improved fee estimation, and improved mempool eviction / re-propagation resistance to improve the ecosystem around delayed transactions and refunds. Smith notes that during high fee periods, transactions could re-propagate between mempools of differing policies resulting in coins being stuck unusable for far longer than the expected 1-2 week eviction.</p>
