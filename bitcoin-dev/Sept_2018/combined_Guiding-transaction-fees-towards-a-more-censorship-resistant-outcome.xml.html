        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>When a user creates a transaction with a fee attached, they incentivize miners to add their transactions to the blockchain. Transactions from Bitcoin Core are more specific in their instructions to miners, requiring them to build on top of the last block instead of reorganizing the blockchain. BIP 115 allows users to create transactions that are only valid if they are mined on top of a specific block, serving as a deterrent for miners to reorganize the blockchain. Coinjoin is another method for users to be more specific, combining payments of multiple users into a single transaction and making it harder for miners to censor specific payments. Ruben Somsen, in a recent post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussed the idea of guiding transaction fees towards a more censorship-resistant outcome. He noted that such line of thinking may inspire further ideas in this direction. In a theoretical scenario where every block contains only a single coinjoin transaction, the validity of which depends on the inclusion of a specific previous block, and the block reward is negligible compared to transaction fees, miners would have to create three empty blocks to overtake the longest chain and undo a specific transaction that happened two blocks ago. However, since users can refuse to let their new transactions be mined on top of the empty blocks, this behavior would be completely disincentivized. While not easy to achieve in practice, this demonstrates the potential for users to become more empowered and benefit censorship resistance.Ruben also pointed out that fee pressure towards censorship resistance happens naturally if the system provides anonymity. If the target transaction that miners wish to censor is indistinguishable from other anonymous transactions, then miners will have no choice but to censor every anonymous transaction, so the end result is very similar to what he imagined linking transactions would do. This highlights the importance of privacy and anonymity in the Bitcoin network. By incentivizing miners to prioritize transactions that promote censorship resistance, users can have more control over their transactions and benefit from increased security.</p>
