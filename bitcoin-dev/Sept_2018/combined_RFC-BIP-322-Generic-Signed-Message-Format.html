        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new standard called the Generic Signed Message Format has been proposed to extend the existing sign/verifymessage format to a more generalized variant relying on the script verification mechanism in Bitcoin itself for message signing/verification. The proposal has been submitted as BIP 322 by Karl-Johan Alm and introduces a new structure SignatureProof that is added as a simple serializable scriptSig & witnessProgram container. Two actions, "Sign" and "Verify," are defined. The specification also outlines the steps for signing and verifying messages. The proposal can be extended to handle proof of funds using the message prefix "POF:", followed by a newline-terminated string, and a series of hex-encoded transaction ID:vout pairs. The current message signing standard only works for P2PKH (1...) addresses, but by extending it to use a Bitcoin Script-based approach, it could be made more generic without causing too much burden on implementers who most likely have access to Bitcoin Script interpreters already.The proposal is not backwards compatible with the legacy signmessage/verifymessage specification but can be used with legacy addresses (1...) without any problems. However, an updated version of the proposal is available at <a href="https://github.com/kallewoof/bips/blob/bip-generic-signmessage/bip-0322.mediawiki">https://github.com/kallewoof/bips/blob/bip-generic-signmessage/bip-0322.mediawiki</a>. A big part of the feedback received was related to whether or not proofs should be given as transactions or not. The advantages of using transaction format include compatibility with existing HSMs, easier incorporation into existing software, forward compatibility with bitcoin extensions such as mimblewimble and confidential transactions, and compatibility with HSMs regardless of whether a transaction or a message or proof of funds is being signed. On the other hand, using transaction format has some drawbacks such as danger if challenger is able to convince prover to sign a message that corresponds to an actual transaction, unupgraded software unable to make distinction between message sign and transaction sign, crippled UX for hardware wallets that show the contents of the transaction during signing, and HSMs not supporting it and not supporting upgrading, which is by design. There is also divided opinion on whether an "OP_MESSAGEONLY" opcode should be introduced, but the priority is addressing the above issues first. In conclusion, the proposal introduces a new structure SignatureProof which is a simple serializable scriptSig & witnessProgram container and defines two actions "Sign" and "Verify". It is not backwards compatible with the legacy signmessage/verifymessage specification, but legacy addresses (1...) may be used in this implementation without any problems.</p>
