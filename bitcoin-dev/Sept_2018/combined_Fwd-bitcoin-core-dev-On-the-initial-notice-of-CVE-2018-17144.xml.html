        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There has been a discovery of a bug in Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC that can be exploited by miners, which could potentially inflate the cryptocurrency's supply. The issue arises because duplicate inputs are not checked in CheckBlock, only when they are accepted into the mempool, creating a problem as a transaction might bypass the mempool when it is included in a block. Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, shared the full text online to address community doubts over the authenticity of awemany's email reporting the vulnerability. An updated version has been released, but many nodes may still be vulnerable until they apply the patch.In response to a claim on Twitter by Andrea Suisani that the report by awemany was about an inflation bug, sickpig questions whether Andrea read it properly. Sickpig mentions that awemany had stated in the report that the assert(is_spent) function "seems" to prevent monetary inflation and speculates that awemany may have prioritized informing Core about the DoS vector he identified rather than exploring the idea of creating coins out of thin air. However, there is confusion about whether awemany knew about the possibility of causing inflation or not.The vulnerability is present in both clients, but it has yet to be exploited. The patch for Core includes changes to its net_processing.cpp, validation.cpp, and tx_verify.cpp files. In net_processing.cpp, some lines of code have been removed from the ProcessGetBlockData function, which previously pushed messages to the node's peers containing transactions in a block. Similarly, some lines of code have also been removed from the ProcessGetData function, which previously sent responses to the node's peers requesting transaction data. In both cases, if no response was required or if the requested transaction was not in the mempool, an entry was added to a list of vNotFound. In the validation.cpp file, the SpendCoins function had an assertion that has now been commented out. Similarly, the UpdateCoins function also had an assertion that has now been commented out. Lastly, a patch has been provided for Core that modifies the CheckTransaction function by skipping the check for duplicate inputs. It is important for users of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC to upgrade to the latest version to avoid any potential vulnerabilities.</p>
