        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core has released a new version, 0.16.3, with bug fixes and an important security upgrade to address a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) that could be exploited by miners. It is recommended for users to upgrade their systems as soon as possible. The release is available for download via the Bitcoin Core website or BitTorrent. Users are cautioned against using newly created wallets in older versions as they will not be compatible, but existing wallets created with older versions are not affected. The new version has been tested extensively on multiple operating systems, including Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista or later. The release notes credit several contributors, including Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, Matt Corallo, Suhas Daftuar, Thomas Kerin, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Additionally, an anonymous reporter is credited for reporting security issues. The new version of Bitcoin Core also addresses a crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction, and now gives an error when an amount is needed but missing. The help output for -prune has also been corrected. Overall, users of Bitcoin Core are strongly advised to upgrade to version 0.16.3 to ensure their security and compatibility with newer wallets.</p>
