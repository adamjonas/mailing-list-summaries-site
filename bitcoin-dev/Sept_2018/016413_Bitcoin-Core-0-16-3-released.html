    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3 has been released with various bug fixes and a critical security upgrade that solves a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2018-17144) exploitable by miners. Users are advised to upgrade their systems as soon as possible. The release is available for download from the Bitcoin Core website or via BitTorrent. The release comes with a warning for users who try to use newly created wallets in older versions, as they will not be compatible. Existing wallets created with older versions are not affected. This release is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista or later. The new version of Bitcoin Core has fixed a crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction. Additionally, an error will now be given when amount is needed but missing. The help output for -prune has also been corrected. The release notes credit Anthony Towns, Hennadii Stepanov, Matt Corallo, Suhas Daftuar, Thomas Kerin, and Wladimir J. van der Laan, who directly contributed to this release. An anonymous reporter is credited for reporting security issues.</p>
