        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On September 17th, a vulnerability was reported to the bitcoin-dev mailing list that related to a denial of service bug. However, it was soon discovered that the issue was also an inflation vulnerability with the same root cause and fix. To encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious Denial of Service vulnerability. At the same time, miners, businesses, and other affected systems were reached out to while publication of the full issue was delayed to give time for systems to upgrade. The bug was fixed in Bitcoin Core versions 0.16.3 and 0.17.0rc4.The technical details of CVE-2018-17144 are explained in a blog post. In summary, any attempts to double-spend a transaction output within a single transaction inside of a block will result in an assertion failure and a crash in Bitcoin Core 0.14.X. In Bitcoin Core 0.15.X, 0.16.0, 0.16.1, and 0.16.2, the same assertion failure will occur if there are attempts to double-spend a transaction output within a single transaction inside of a block where the output being spent was created in the same block.A timeline for the discovery and response to the vulnerability is provided. On September 20, 2018, David Jaenson independently discovered the vulnerability and reported it to the Bitcoin Core security contact email. It's critical that affected users upgrade and apply the latest patches to prevent the possibility of large reorganizations, mining of invalid blocks, or acceptance of invalid transactions.</p>
