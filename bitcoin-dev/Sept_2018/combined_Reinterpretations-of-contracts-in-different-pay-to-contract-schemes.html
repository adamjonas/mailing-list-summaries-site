        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj has raised concerns about the possibility of issues arising when different pay-to-contract schemes are used on Bitcoin. The concern is that the byte serialization of a contract under one scheme could be reinterpreted as the byte serialization of a different contract under a different scheme, which could lead to users unknowingly committing to a different contract than what they intended. This issue could also allow for a Bitcoin-level UTXO to be stolen without knowledge of the private key if an independent protocol uses pay-to-contract, and the contract is reinterpreted as a Bitcoin SCRIPT under Taproot.To avoid these issues, ZmnSCPxj suggests using the hash of the contract as a tweak and proposing that pay-to-contract schemes should pay to the below tweak: Q = P + SHA256d(P || Scheme || C) * G. `Scheme` is a 256 bits (32 bytes) scheme identifier, which for Taproot could be the genesis block ID. Other pay-to-contract schemes must ensure that they use a `Scheme` ID that is different with high probability from other `Scheme` IDs, in order to ensure that reinterpretation of contracts is impossible.</p>
