    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the security of Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects with respect to multiple RBF policies being used. The security of these protocols partially depends on policy rules, which is not the case for the base blockchain/network. However, certain defaults can bolster the security of Lightning and other Layer 2 projects at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols. Bitcoin Core with different versions is used at any point, and it is unclear if this will ever change. The vast majority of full nodes on the network currently run Bitcoin Core, but there is an option to set defaults that are widely used. While the recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are mainly focused on Lightning Network, contributors to other Layer 2 projects are free to flag and discuss security considerations that aren't Lightning-specific. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI - users can readily choose whatever policy they want.</p>
