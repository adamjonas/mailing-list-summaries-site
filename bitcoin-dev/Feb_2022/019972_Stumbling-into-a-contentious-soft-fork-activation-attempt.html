    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, there was disagreement over whether Bitcoin should be scaled rapidly or not. Some argue that scaling should not be delayed for the purpose of keeping fees high. They suggest that if higher fees are needed, the block size can be lowered or the default minimum relay fee rate increased. Additionally, they question the notion that the Lightning Network is the primary cause of recent low fees and contend that delaying scaling would harm Bitcoin's growth.Others argue that the various new use cases for on-chain transactions may compete with existing users for scarce blockchain space. This situation has been likened to the old saying "nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded."The conversation also touched upon the issue of invoking Satoshi's opinions in present-day discussions. One participant objected to assumptions about the founder of Bitcoin and argued that Satoshi is more than just a pseudonym and will stay alive forever. However, another participant objected to the invocation of Satoshi in general and suggested that if he wants to participate in Bitcoin development today, he can speak for himself. They added that if Satoshi refuses to participate, his opinion is irrelevant.</p>
