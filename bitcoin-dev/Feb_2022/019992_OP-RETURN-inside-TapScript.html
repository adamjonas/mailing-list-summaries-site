    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Since Taproot was activated, it's no longer necessary to create separate OP_RETURN outputs to be pushed on-chain. Users can now attach any data to a transaction by creating an "OP_RETURN" branch in the TapScript. By doing this, they can store data off-chain and always prove that it's connected with some taproot address, which was pushed on-chain. Furthermore, they can store more than 80 bytes for free since no such taproot branch will ever be pushed on-chain and used as an input. Ruben Somsen notes that committing to an ECC point allows users to tweak it to commit data inside it (i.e. pay-to-contract), including P2PK and P2PKH. This means that users can commit to 1.5GB of data using OP_RETURN or even an entire merkle tree of hashes, as is the case with Todd's opentimestamps. However, tweaking an ECC point in non-deterministic ways also makes it harder to recover from backup since it requires knowing the full commitment. It's worth noting that the scheme isn't equivalent to op_return because it requires the user to communicate out-of-band to reveal the commitment, whereas with op_return the data is immediately visible. While not popular, BIP47 and various colored coin protocols rely on this. That said, storing additional data on-chain is expensive, and Ruben suggests that attaching data to the TapScript takes zero additional bytes on-chain and can be done using a taproot public key as usual.</p>
