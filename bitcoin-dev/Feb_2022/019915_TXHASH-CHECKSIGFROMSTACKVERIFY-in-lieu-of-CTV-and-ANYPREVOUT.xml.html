    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Jeremy Rubin discusses the differences between CTV and TXHASH. While it has been claimed that CTV is just as powerful as TXHASH, Rubin points out several differences that make this claim invalid. Firstly, CTV requires the contract to be fully enumerated and is non-recursive, making it difficult to write contracts for open-ended scenarios. Secondly, CTV also requires the contract to be entirely enumerated which can limit the set of outcomes a-priori. Lastly, Rubin combines both of these issues to create an example of how CTV would struggle with creating many identical outputs over time without constraining what those outputs are. Rusty Russell agrees with Rubin's assessment and adds that the distinction between recursive and not recursive is less useful than the distinction between "limited to complete enumeration" which is a bright line between CTV and TXHASH. Russell also notes that while there has been some concern about complex scripting leading to people losing money, he rejects that idea and believes that since scripts exist, we should make tools as clean and clear as possible.</p>
