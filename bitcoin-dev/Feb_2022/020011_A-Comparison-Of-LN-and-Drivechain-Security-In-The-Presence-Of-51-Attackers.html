    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj presents a quiz to identify those who understand Drivechain. The quiz consists of ten questions, and if one can answer all the questions, then they have a good understanding of Drivechain. The first question explains why changing DC to make miner-theft impossible is not a viable solution. The second question asks how long it would take for 100% hashrate to steal coins from a DC sidechain. The third question is about the number of DC withdrawals per sidechain per year and who should use the DC withdrawal system. The fourth question relates to what b and m parameters represent in the DC security model. The fifth question explores how m can be above 1 and what attributes might cause this situation to arise. The sixth question asks which range of m DC is designed to deter sc-theft. Question seven asks why it would be bad for sidechain users if DC could be magically changed to deter theft across all ranges of m. The eighth question examines how using a mainchain UASF to prohibit future theft-withdrawal affects non-DC users. The ninth question is about the ways BTC network might become uncompetitive and how it differs from caring about a sidechain's m and b. Finally, the tenth question is regarding who would be harmed if DC were successful. However, ZmnSCPxj admits that he does not know the answer to this question.</p>
