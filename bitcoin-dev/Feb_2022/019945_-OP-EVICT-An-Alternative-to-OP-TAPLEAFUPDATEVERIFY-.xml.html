    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post discusses two points related to evictions, revivals, CTV, TLUV and Eltoo. The first point explains how CTV enables one person to be evicted in O(log N) or leave in O(log N), while TLUV enables one person to leave in O(1) O(log N) transactions, but evictions take O(N) O(log N) transactions. OP_EVICT helps kick someone out instead of all having to leave, which is an improvement. Rejoining with CTV works by doing log N txns to evict the failure, creating R * log_R(N) outputs, which can then do a transaction to rejoin. Overall, exact byte counting is needed for this application.Another option is to randomize the CTV trees with multiple outputs per party (radix Q). This method has the potential to improve the efficiency of CTV. The second point raises discomfort with Eltoo because non-punitive channels may not be suitable for high-value channels as punishments incentivize correct behavior. Thus, designs that do not allow nested traditional punitive channels should be used cautiously. A punitive-eltoo variant that would ameliorate this concern almost entirely would be preferable.The post also discusses the use of TLUV in CoinPool revival where you want to prevent equivocation among the remaining set of signers. Modifications can be made to make it functional for CoinPool revival, and at least one signature validation may be required.Finally, the post talks about how OP_EVICT is "just" a redesigned OP_TLUV and supports eviction by pool unanimity in case of irresponsive participants.
