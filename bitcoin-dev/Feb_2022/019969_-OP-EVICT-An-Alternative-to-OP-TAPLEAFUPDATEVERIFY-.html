    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Antoine Riard and ZmnSCPxj discusses the implementation of a CoinPool hosted inside a Decker-Wattenhofer or Decker-Russell-Osuntokun construction, with a focus on the eviction mechanism. TLUV is discussed as a possible way to create an "N-of-N With Eviction" construction, which enables the remaining participants to evict offline participants and continue operating in their absence. However, TLUV enforces a constraint in the spends path ordering. In contrast, OP_EVICT removes the constraint in the spends paths ordering and also allows for multiple evictions and the revival of the CoinPool in a single transaction. The disadvantage of OP_EVICT is that it requires point operations. The conversation also explores the possibility of preventing eviction abuse where one counterparty threatens to evict everyone as all the output signatures are known among participants and free to sum. The conclusion is that on-chain fees are currently the only mechanism to avoid such abuse. Finally, the advantage of TLUV over CTV is discussed in terms of revivable constructs with eviction of participants.</p>
