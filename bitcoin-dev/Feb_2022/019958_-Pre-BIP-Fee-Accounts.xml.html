    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, the discussion is around the design of opt-in or explicit tagging of fee account. One member argues that this is a bad design as it requires pre-planning and can limit flexibility. For example, if someone is building a vault meant to distribute funds over many years, having a specific pre-committed key that needs to be maintained can be problematic. Additionally, if someone sends a low-fee transaction that the recipient wants to bump, but the sender has opted out, it would be better if the recipient could always fee bump. Another member points out that while replacement transactions should not happen often, there is no guarantee that they won't occur and cause potential issues. The overall discussion centers around the need for flexibility in fee account design and the potential risks associated with certain approaches.</p>
