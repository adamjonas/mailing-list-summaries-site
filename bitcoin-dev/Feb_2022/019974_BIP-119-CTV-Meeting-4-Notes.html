    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The main focus of today's meeting was to get CTV Signet up and running and test out some contracts. There was discussion regarding the goals of a signet, but no conclusions were reached. It is uncertain how much interest people will have in Signet with CTV compared to other forks that are more readily available. The tutorial section involved walking through a guide posted on the list, which was met with difficulties due to local environments and brittle bash scripts. Participants were able to finish the tutorial during the session, and their transactions can be seen on the provided links. Future tutorials will continue to try new contracts, but will also utilize the GUI instead of just the CLI.</p>
