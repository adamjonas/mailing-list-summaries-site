    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy proposed some thoughts for conceptual review on how to clean up fee paying semantics in Bitcoin. He discussed the difficulties of expressing transaction logic and fees in long-lived smart contracts, as fees are part of transactions they occur in. One solution he proposed was establishing an account system in Bitcoin as an extension block. However, Peter Todd pointed out that this introduces its own kind of transaction pinning attacks by allowing third parties to attach arbitrary fees to any transaction without permission, potentially delaying the mining of desired transactions. To fix this issue, transactions should be allowed to designate a pubkey allowed to add further transaction fees if required. Two existing forms in Bitcoin include Replace-by-Fee and Child Pays for Parent.</p>
