    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin suggested that those who oppose recursive covenants should speak out and present credible arguments. The objection raised is that recursion can admit partial computation, which implies that the halting problem cannot be solved for arbitrary programs in the language. However, proponents of recursive covenants argue that the risk of recursion can be mitigated by constructing programs from provably-terminating components. They suggest that people can avoid accepting coin encumbered with a script that is not trivially shown to be non-recursive. Another counterargument is to design the language so that such constructs are outright rejected by the language as a semantic error. While users should have the freedom to shoot themselves in the feet, it is important to keep walking with two feet as long as possible. A valid alternate approach is to build a separate tool that checks if a script can be proven to be non-recursive, but this could be seen as too much work for some users. Therefore, some proponents suggest that an operation that is provably non-recursive should be built into the interpreter itself.</p>
