    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Paul Sztorc, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has responded to a previous message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list where Drivechains was rejected. Sztorc argues that mainchain miners and sidechain validators have no strong incentive to merge their businesses, and sidechains on Drivechains don't become a block size increase. He believes that merged mining is not different from any other source of mining profitability, and there is an irrational prejudice against it. Sztorc also refutes the claim that the sidechain-to-mainchain peg degrades the security of sidechain users. He argues that Drivechain will not work if 51% hashrate is attacking the network, but that is also the case for the Lightning Network. Sztorc concludes that he thinks Drivechain was ahead of its time and will eventually be adopted in some form.</p>
