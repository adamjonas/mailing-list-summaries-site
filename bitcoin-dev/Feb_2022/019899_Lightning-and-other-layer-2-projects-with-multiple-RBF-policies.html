    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects is partly dependent on policy rules, which impacts the base blockchain/network. However, this is not a reason to abandon current designs in the absence of an alternative that offers a superior security model. Users are free to run different policy rules without making them effective consensus rules. Most users will likely run whatever the defaults are, but those with a stake in the security of Lightning (or other Layer 2 projects) will want to run the policy rules beneficial to those protocols. The recent improvements suggested for RBF policy have focused on Lightning security, but contributors to other Layer 2 projects can flag and discuss security considerations that aren't Lightning specific. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, allowing users to choose whatever policy they want. The maintainer(s) and contributors to Bitcoin Knots are free to determine what default policy rules they want to implement. There is the option to set defaults that are widely used with the strong dominance of Bitcoin Core, and if certain defaults can bolster the security of Lightning (and possibly other Layer 2 projects) at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols, then it should be discussed what those defaults should be.</p>
