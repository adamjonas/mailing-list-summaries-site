    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Billy Tetrud asked for clarification on the statement that "every lightning network transaction adds one dust UTXO" and provided a link to the message in question. The writer clarified that his statement was technically incorrect and should have been "most of the time only one of them is spent," but nothing prevents both UTXOs from being spent. They are equivalent, with the only difference being the public key that can sign for them. Inserting them into the UTXO set does not allow for distinguishing between them, and it is impossible to know beforehand which one will be spent. UTXO set size is something that will need to be addressed at some point, and while Eric Voskuil suggested outputs unlikely to be spent can easily be stored off RAM, Pieter Wuille argued against deleting them entirely from the UTXO set as it could be considered theft and potentially destroy useful funds. Instead, it may be useful to investigate using amount as a heuristic about what to keep and how long. The discussion also touched on archiving non-standard and burned UTXOs, with debates over whether it should be a standardness or consensus rule.</p>
