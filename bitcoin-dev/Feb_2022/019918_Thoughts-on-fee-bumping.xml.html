    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context of sponsor transactions, monotone refers to the validity of a sponsored transaction being "monotonically" true at any point after its inclusion in a block. Regarding tx-index, not all nodes have the ability to look up transactions by their ID, as each bitcoind node only has a map of unspent coins that can be referenced by outpoint. The map of (txid -> transaction) for all time is a separate index that must be enabled via the `-txindex=1` flag. The current consensus threshold for transactions to become invalid is a 100 block reorg. In case of a reorg deeper than 100 blocks, it would permanently invalidate any transactions spending the recently-matured coinbase subsidy in any block between $new_reorg_tip and ($former_tip_height - 100). These invalidated spends would not be able to be reorganized into a new replacement chain. However, if this were to happen, there would likely be bigger issues at hand than just coinbase invalidation.</p>
