    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Zac, in a recent conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggested that reducing the footprint of storing data on-chain could be achieved by supporting it. Currently, data is stored wastefully by being embedded inside an OP_RETURN within a transaction structure. However, by supporting the storage of raw data without creating a transaction, waste can be reduced. However, Zac raised a valid point that if the data is not embedded inside a transaction, how would one pay a miner to include the data on the blockchain? The current design requires having a transaction in order to pay a miner. Therefore, Zac suggests that embedding the data into the same transaction used to pay the miner would be more efficient. Overall, there are pros and cons to both approaches, but it's important to consider solutions that minimize waste and improve efficiency when it comes to storing data on the blockchain.</p>
