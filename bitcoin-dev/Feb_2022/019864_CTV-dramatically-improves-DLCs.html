    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread, several points were raised regarding the use of CSFS and its effectiveness in providing privacy benefits. It was noted that while CSFS could be used in both the oracle and transaction restriction parts of the DLC, it does not provide the same model as DLC. Additionally, there was discussion about the performance benefits of the CTV approach, which allows for computation of oracle anticipation points without signing or verification. A benchmark comparison was made between the current approach with signing and verification and only computing the anticipation points, resulting in a performance improvement of roughly 24x for the serial case and 10x for the parallel case. The benchmarks are available on GitHub. One potential concern raised was the impact of having a large taproot tree on the size of witness data when spending script paths that are low in the tree and how it would affect transaction fees. Finally, there was a discussion about the Y axis being the dependent variable represented by the CTV hashes in a contract, and how this affects the cheaper part of the DLC in lightning channels that might be updated between parties frequently.</p>
