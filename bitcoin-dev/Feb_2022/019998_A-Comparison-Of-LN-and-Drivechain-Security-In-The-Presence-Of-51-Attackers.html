    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev post, ZmnSCPxj confirmed that it is true that a 51% hashrate could double-spend in the Lightning Network (LN). Both LN and Drivechain are vulnerable to miner-theft, but they use their design to deter theft. However, a 51% miner can only attack LN channels in which it is a participant, while it can simultaneously attack all Drivechain-based sidechains and steal all of their funds. In LN, the main obstacle is that the miner-coalition must first join the channel, whereas in DC, the main obstacle is constructing a transaction obeying the Bip300 rules. The Bip300 rules are designed specifically to thwart miner-theft. A quiz was presented to identify individuals knowledgeable about Drivechain. Users should be free to decide what risks they take with their money and be allowed to spend their BTC to a Bip300 script, just as they are allowed to open an LN channel.</p>
