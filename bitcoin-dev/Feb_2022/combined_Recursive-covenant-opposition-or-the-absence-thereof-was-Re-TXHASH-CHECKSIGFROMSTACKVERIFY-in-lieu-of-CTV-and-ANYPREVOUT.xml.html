        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is currently discussing the safety concerns surrounding drivechains. Some participants argue that it is possible to prevent funds from being stolen, while others believe that deposited funds could end up in a bidding war between the legitimate owner and someone attempting to steal them.In 2017, discussions around the use of drivechains and sidechains took place on the Bitcoin-dev thread. Participants argued that their security models were not in line with Bitcoin's and were not a good solution for the project. While some argued against using drivechains, others stated that people should be free to experiment if they're not creating a burden on everyone else.Participants agreed that users should encourage miners to steal funds deposited into drivechains to discourage their adoption. Additionally, the discussion highlighted the possibility of creating encumbrances using a recursive covenant script that would require any spend from the covenant to be sent to a script involving a specific key controlled by an authority figure.While some have expressed concerns about the risks of recursive covenants, no credible argument has been presented against them. However, the same technology that enables "vaults" also allows for drivechains, which constrains how withdrawals work, but whether it is enough to prevent cheating remains debatable.Bip300 adds additional restrictions to make it less risky and provides honest participants with an opportunity to react to miners attempting to cheat and achieve a legitimate outcome. In the case of Liquid, a group of semi-known functionaries who are also responsible for transactions appearing on the Liquid sidechain sign via multisig to move funds. Overall, the debate around drivechains continues, with different viewpoints and opinions.</p>
