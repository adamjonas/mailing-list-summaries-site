        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion on the Bitcoin developers mailing list focused on replacing a transaction with a higher fee in the mempool, which may invalidate its dependent transactions. Bastien Teinturier proposed an alternative approach to descendants that could make designing new rules for the network easier. However, another developer argued that the goal is to discourage people from wasting the network's bandwidth.Gloria Zhao suggested combining outbound transaction relay size-based rate-limiting and prioritizing transaction relay by feerate with inbound transaction request rate-limiting to prevent DoS regardless of the fee-based replacement policies. There was some confusion about whether prioritizing transactions by ancestor feerate is appropriate in this scheme.The discussion also touched on a split between anti-spam rules and mempool acceptance rules for economic and spam incentives, respectively, which could help prevent anti-spam rules from blocking transactions entirely. Descendants only matter for DoS resistance and not for miner incentives. An edge case was mentioned where replacing a transaction may make its descendants obsolete, but the total fees paid by the package of related transactions are still higher than the fees paid by the replacing transaction and its unrelated transactions.Two policies were proposed for addressing miner incentives, but they may be insufficient for addressing DoS issues, requiring a third policy. Finally, "Y% higher" rather than just "higher" is thought to be useful mainly for rate-limiting and not incentive compatibility. The effective fee rate is suggested as a better metric to track, but it is also noted that the replacement transaction may never come or if it does, it might not pay enough for its own descendants. A weight-based rate limit on transactions could help alleviate this issue.</p>
