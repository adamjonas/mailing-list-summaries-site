    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Billy Tetrud and Paul, the topic of large block sidechains was discussed. Paul argued that these sidechains should be reconsidered despite the criticisms they have received in the past. He noted that while some arguments against large blocks may still apply to large block sidechains, they would indeed result in a block size increase for those who follow them. Paul also addressed the issue of decentralization, arguing that it is not simply a matter of more or less being better or worse. In his view, decentralization must be enough to stop a class of attack, otherwise it would be catastrophic. He further stated that making the blocksize 10 times larger is a poor design choice, and advocating for such a thing on a sidechain is just as bad as advocating for it on an altcoin.Billy disagreed with this viewpoint, stating that in a world where many chains can be created, it does not matter what experts think is "pretty clear". Instead, the only thing that matters is that people can try things out and are rewarded for successes and punished for mistakes. He argued that censorship of ideas is immoral and largely pointless, and that suppressing creativity is the most dangerous experiment of all. Finally, Paul argued that if there were design principles that allowed for safely increasing the block size substantially, he would advocate for it in bitcoin. However, the goal of sidechains should not be to "shoot from the hip" and burn users before learning valuable lessons. Despite this, Billy maintained his position that experimentation should not be suppressed and that sidechains should be allowed to operate freely.</p>
