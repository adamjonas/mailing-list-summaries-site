        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new DNS system has been proposed that aims to provide a privacy-maximizing service to clients while having extremely low resource requirements and minimal attack surface. The proposal suggests using non-interactive oracles to reduce their attack surface, which could emit attestations for each quantum time step instead of signing over a client-provided timestamp. When the oracles produce agreeing messages, the additional data is only 64 bytes per additional signer, so it makes sense to broadcast any a client may want to trust.Clients can consider their view of the current network state to be strong when several of their oracle sources present agreeing signatures, or display an error to their user if no suitable number of attestations could be found. Fault or fraud proofs can be generated by any party by simply collecting differing signatures, making errors readily apparent and provable.To ensure the security of their transactions, host names and their associated keys would be baked into the binaries of client software supporting the system, while their location and credentials could be attested in a text file of their primary domain. Oracles would return the current block hash, hash of the tip of the neutrino header chain, and an ECDSA signature over the data including the requesting quantized timestamp, giving the client sufficient and portable evidence that their view of the state of the network has not been tampered with, while maintaining as much privacy as possible.The related design document is available at <a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/blob/master/oracle.md">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/blob/master/oracle.md</a>. The oracles' messages can be delivered over a write-only channel like Kryptoradio or Blockstream Satellite, which would scale well. This proposal is related to the Validating Lightning Signer project, where it would allow the signer to ensure that the channel is still active. Overall, this proposal can provide a privacy-maximizing service to lightweight clients while ensuring the security of their transactions.</p>
