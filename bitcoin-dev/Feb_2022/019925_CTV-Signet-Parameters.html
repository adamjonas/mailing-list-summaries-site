    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message has been running a CTV signet for a year, but it has seen little use. They had issues syncing new nodes early on, but have since verified syncability using a certain GitHub repository. The author provides the necessary information to access the signet and encourages others to use it, while also offering to send coins to anyone interested in running an automatic faucet. In another thread, AJ expressed concerns about the lack of third-party experimentation on Jeremy's CTV signet, suggesting that deploying the feature on the default global signet could help with real-world testing. The author agrees that real experimentation would be helpful and believes that merging the code (without activation) for signet would be beneficial for users. The author mentions that they regularly conduct experiments on regtest and mainnet, but notes that setting up signet requires more time and effort. They suggest that seeing more RPC test samples for regtests could be a sufficient alternative.</p>
