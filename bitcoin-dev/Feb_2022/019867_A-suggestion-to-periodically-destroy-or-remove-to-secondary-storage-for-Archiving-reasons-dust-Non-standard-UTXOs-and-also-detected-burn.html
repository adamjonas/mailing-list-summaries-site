    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Lightning network transactions create dust UTXOs, which is a problem for the UTXO set size that will need to be addressed at some point. One potential solution is the use of utreexo or another accumulator. In the meantime, Eric Voskuil suggests that outputs unlikely to be spent can be stored off ram and wouldn't be much of an issue to keep around. However, Pieter Wuille argues that dropping them entirely from the UTXO set could potentially destroy useful funds people own. Wuille also mentions the idea of removing them to secondary storage for archiving with extra cost to get them back, along with non-standard UTXOs and burned ones. This raises questions about whether this should be implemented as a standardness rule or a consensus rule. There is no requirement that such a rule remain in place, and depending on how feerate economics work out in the future, such outputs may not remain uneconomical to spend.</p>
