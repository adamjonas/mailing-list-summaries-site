    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation about drivechains, ZmnSCPxj argues that if drivechains are bad for Bitcoin, then recursive covenants should not be added. However, if there is a consensus that the arguments against drivechains are bogus, then recursive covenants should be added. ZmnSCPxj believes that drivechains are not a scaling solution and that adding more non-scaling-useable functionality is not of interest to him. He is wary of adding Turing-completeness due to Principle of Least Power. He is concerned that recursive covenants may enable other unknown techniques that may have negative effects on Bitcoin or would be undesirable by a significant section of the userbase. ZmnSCPxj asks to add `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` and `OP_CTV` first before adding recursive covenants. ZmnSCPxj also notes that sidechains are not a scaling solution and are beaten in raw scaling by Lightning. Blockchains are inefficient, and you have to show your transaction to everyone. While sidechains imply that particular subsets are the only ones interested in transactions, they still require publishing to all sidechain participants. In comparison, Lightning Network involves only a tiny fraction of the network in any payment, making it a superior scaling solution.</p>
