    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bastien discusses the need to discourage people from wasting the network's bandwidth by publishing transactions that will never get confirmed. Descendants only matter for DoS resistance, not for miner incentives. He proposes separating policies that address miner incentives from policies that address the DoS issues and adding a 3rd policy to address DoS issues. He thinks that rate-limiting p2p is likely a better way of fixing the DoS concerns than a descendant rule like BIP 125 rule 5. He adds a small update to his policy suggestions where the X and Y percentage increase should be met for both the ancestor scores AND the transaction in isolation. He also discusses the timeline for using an updated set of policies and whether multi-party contracts are vulnerable by design considering they rely on policy that cannot be enforced. He explains the scenario where he has txA that he wants to RBF but only has unconfirmed utxos and can't simply lower its existing outputs to reach his desired feerate. He must make one of his unconfirmed utxos confirm asap just to be able to use it to RBF txA. This means he'll need to pay fees a first time just to convert one of his unconfirmed utxos to a confirmed one. Then he'll pay the fees to bump txA and had to overpay fees compared to just using his unconfirmed utxo in the first place. Finally, Prayank provides feedback on Bastien's proposal and expresses interest in hearing other people's thoughts.</p>
