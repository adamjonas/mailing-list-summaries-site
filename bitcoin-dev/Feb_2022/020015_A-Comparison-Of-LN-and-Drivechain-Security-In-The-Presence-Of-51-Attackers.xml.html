    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, ZmnSCPxj presented a quiz designed to test knowledge of Drivechain. The quiz included questions about the security model of Drivechain, the types of people who should use the withdrawal system, and how users can move coins from chain to chain. The quiz also discussed the parameters "m" and "b," which represent how much people want to kill a sidechain and how much profit a mainchain miner expects from supporting a sidechain, respectively. Additionally, the quiz touched on how m can be above one, how DC is designed to deter sc-theft, and how the BTC network might become uncompetitive. Finally, the quiz noted that if DC were successful, Altcoin-investors would be harmed and two Maximalist-groups would also be slightly harmed, though it did not identify these groups.</p>
