    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about improving fee estimation in Bitcoin Core, it was mentioned that mempool cannot be considered an orderbook due to nodes using different relay policies. The possibility of different RBF policies being used by nodes in the future could affect the security of Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects. An attacker could use a different RBF policy with some nodes, 10% hash power, and affect the security of different projects relying on default RBF policy in latest Bitcoin Core. A CVE was reported where RBF policy not being documented according to implementation could affect the security of LN. It raises questions about whether Lightning Network and other layer 2 projects are vulnerable to multiple RBF policies being used. There have been recent discussions to change things in default RBF policy used by Core, which could lead to multiple versions using different policies. Users and miners may have the freedom to use different RBF policy. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, and users can readily choose whatever policy they want.</p>
