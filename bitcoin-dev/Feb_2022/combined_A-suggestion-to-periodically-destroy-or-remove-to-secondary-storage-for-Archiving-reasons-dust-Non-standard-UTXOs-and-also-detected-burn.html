        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The issue of UTXO set size has been a topic of discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. One potential solution to the problem is to use utreexo or another accumulator. Eric Voskuil suggests that outputs unlikely to be spent can be stored off ram, while Pieter Wuille argues against deleting them entirely from the UTXO set as it could potentially destroy useful funds people own. Instead, he suggests removing them to secondary storage for archiving with extra cost to get them back, along with non-standard UTXOs and burned ones.During the discussion, Billy Tetrud brought up the idea of using economic incentives to disincentivize the creation of new UTXOs. This proposal suggests charging a fee based on (bytes*byte_weight + net_utxos*utxo_weight) instead of byte size. For example, if utxo_weight is set to 500, a transaction that creates 2 new UTXOs would cost as if it were 1 KB in size. However, this proposal would require lowering the block size cap by max(0, net_utxos_created*utxo_weight), which could be implemented through a soft fork but may be contentious.Lightning network transactions create dust UTXOs, which is a problem for the UTXO set size that will need to be addressed at some point. While one potential solution is the use of utreexo or another accumulator, there is debate over whether to remove dust UTXOs entirely from the UTXO set or store them in secondary storage for archiving. There is also a question of whether to implement this as a standardness rule or a consensus rule.Moreover, discussions have touched on the issue of how to handle the extensive amount of dust created by Alt coins and new protocols. One suggestion is to divide 1 Satoshi into fractions or accept a UTXO with 0 value, which could be considered non-standard transactions. There are currently no rules that demand any minimal fee for anything, and it's unclear what those rules, if any, should be.In a thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussions revolve around archiving non-standard and burned UTXOs. While some suggest deleting or trimming low-value UTXOs, others argue against it as it could potentially destroy useful funds that Bitcoin holders own. Instead, it may be useful to investigate using amount as a heuristic about what to keep and for how long. The discussion also touched on whether it should be a standardness or consensus rule.Lastly, a thread on Bitcointalk poses the question of how to handle the extensive amount of dust created by Alt coins and new protocols. The suggestion is to divide 1 Satoshi into fractions or accept a UTXO with 0 value, which could be considered non-standard transactions. The email from 2016 regarding non-standard transactions is referenced.In conclusion, the issue of UTXO set size is a complex one with multiple potential solutions being discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. While some suggest the use of economic incentives to disincentivize the creation of new UTXOs, others debate whether to remove dust UTXOs entirely from the UTXO set or store them in secondary storage for archiving. The discussion also touches on the issue of how to handle dust created by Alt coins and new protocols.</p>
