    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent thread, it was revealed that there are at least 5.7 million UTXOs with less than or equal to 1000 Sat (~7%), 8.04 million with less than or equal to 1 dollar (10%), and 13.5 million less than or equal to 0.0001 BTC (17%). BitInfoCharts has added a main link for dust analysis where you can see the first address containing more than 1.7 million dust UTXOs. It is believed that some blockchain tracking analysts will "dust" addresses that were spent from, in the hope that lousy wallets will use the new 546-sat UTXO from the same address but spending to a different address and combining with other inputs with new addresses. JoinMarket has a policy to ignore-by-default UTXOs that pay to an address it already spent from, precisely due to this practice. It is suggested that the effect can be eliminated by removing outputs of exactly 546 sats to reused addresses.</p>
