    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author expresses their reluctance to add Turing-completeness due to the Principle of Least Power. They give an example of how this principle played out in web browser technology, where a full Turing-complete language was initially included but had very loose boundaries and no protections against things like cross-site scripting. Eventually, W3C made restrictions and modern JavaScript is now more sandboxed than before. The author believes that for the most part, Turing-completeness is dangerous and that Bitcoin, which protects money, is more important than the web. They express some reticence towards recursive covenants and other things it may enable, as they can be implemented in a Turing-complete language. The author acknowledges that the Principle of Least Power was developed for the web, which is a server-client protocol, while Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, so it may not apply to Bitcoin. However, they argue that the principle exists precisely because increased power often lets third parties do more than what was expected, including things that might damage the interests of the people who allowed the increased power to exist. Despite the problems that JavaScript introduced, it also introduced GMail and the now-rich Web ecosystem. The author ends with a warning against seeking counsel from elves, who will say both no and yes, and poses the question of whether there is hope at the bottom of the box opened by Pandora.</p>
