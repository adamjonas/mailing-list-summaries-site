    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects is impacted by policy rules, and it is best to utilize current designs despite this. While running different policy rules are possible, research into Lightning security is still nascent, and incentives for running the same or differing policies are not yet clear. However, with the majority of the full nodes on the network currently running Bitcoin Core, setting defaults that bolster the security of Lightning (and possibly other Layer 2 projects) without cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols should be discussed. Multiple RBF policies being used by nodes in the future can affect the security of different projects that rely on default RBF policy in latest Bitcoin Core, as an attacker can use a different RBF policy with some nodes and 10% hash power. The recent improvements suggested for RBF policy have primarily focused on Lightning Network security. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI. Experiments on signet may help to understand more issues associated with multiple RBF policies, and research in this area is encouraged.</p>
