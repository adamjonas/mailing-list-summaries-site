    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email communication between Prayank and Peter, Prayank shared two links suggesting compelling use cases for Bitcoin. However, Peter clarified that he was referring to "compelling use-cases clearly beneficial to all users" rather than just a small subset of users. He argued that some of the use cases mentioned in the links could harm all users, such as Drivechains being potentially harmful to the security of Bitcoin as a whole or new uses for on-chain transactions competing for scarce blockchain space. Peter emphasized the need to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of making core consensus changes to Bitcoin, given its almost $1 trillion dollar system, both for each proposal in isolation and the precedent-making it sets.</p>
