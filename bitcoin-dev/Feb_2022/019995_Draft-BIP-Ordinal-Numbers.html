    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the future, it is possible that payment precision could be increased by going sub-satoshi on chain. However, this introduces a potential problem with ordinal numbers if a Monero-like system is introduced that hides coin amounts. A possible solution would be to use zero satoshi, which could be used in many ways to introduce different protocols and also add fractional satoshis on-chain. However, if these amounts are simply ignored, it may be difficult to connect the future protocol based on that with ordinal numbers. The use of zero as an amount is interesting because it means "skip amount checking for old clients." This could have implications for backwards-compatibility.</p>
