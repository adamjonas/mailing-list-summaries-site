        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Bitcoin developers' mailing list, Paul Sztorc proposed the implementation of "alerts," which would render transactions invalid if they referenced block content on a "pretender block." However, there is an issue of constructing a block for which invalidity cannot be proven. While proof can be shown for an invalid transaction within a well-formed block, there is no way to show proof that a block is not well-formed. This could lead to a perfectly valid block with some transactions withheld until it becomes stale, making it impossible for full nodes and miners to accept it without knowing the entire block's transactions. The only solution to this problem is for users to demand the full block from attackers, but this makes it easy for attackers to DoS users by giving them bogus incomplete-block claims.The concept of incentivizing users to offer proof that a block has invalid content goes back to Satoshi's whitepaper, and would be useful for Alice, running an SPV client. Paul Sztorc suggests that "alerts" would be relatively straightforward and provides details on how this could work using a new OP code. He also explains how "fraud proofs" (as they are now called) require a significant engineering overhaul, and outlines a proposed solution involving the creation of an OP Code called "OP FraudProof." This OP Code can then be used in a transaction where Alice would provide 1 BTC and X would provide 0.2 BTC. If X signs, Alice assumes the block is invalid and stops offering to buy fraud proofs on it. If he does not sign, Alice gets her money back + 0.2 BTC from Eric for wasting her time. Paul Sztorc notes that the definition of an "invalid transaction" could be either a script which fails or a double-spend.In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user Paul Sztorc expressed confusion about how segwit (Segregated Witness) would help. Another member of the community, Bryan, provided a link to discussions on the topic that had taken place on the bitcoin-core-dev chat channel in December 2015. The link is not currently available, but it may have contained useful information for those seeking to understand the potential benefits of segwit.</p>
