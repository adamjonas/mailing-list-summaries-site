    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr, a developer at Bitcoin via bitcoin-dev, suggested that the BIP9 proposal should progress to 'Accepted' stage. However, it is not clear whether it falls under the Draft/Accepted/Final classification of proposals requiring implementation or the Draft/Active classification like process BIPs. The discussion can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/413">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/413</a>. Dashjr argues that BIP9 should also be a "Standard BIP" instead of an informational one because it is included as part of the BIP68 standard. He further explains that if BIP9 was ever modified, it would most likely do so with a new BIP, and in soft-forks using that new standard, would refer to the new BIP #.Dashjr reviewed the criteria for status changes and believes that BIPs 68, 112, 113, and 141 are implementations of BIP9 and fall under the Draft/Accepted/Final class. Additionally, he notes that BIPs 68, 112, and 113 have been deployed to the network successfully and have satisfied the conditions of not only Accepted status but also Final status. Therefore, he suggests that all four BIPs (BIPs 9, 68, 112, and 113) should be updated to Final status in one month. Since all four BIPs are currently Draft, he needs at least one author from each BIP to sign-off on promoting them to (and beyond) Accepted. Peter Todd, a developer at Bitcoin, responded with an ACK ("Final" status).</p>
