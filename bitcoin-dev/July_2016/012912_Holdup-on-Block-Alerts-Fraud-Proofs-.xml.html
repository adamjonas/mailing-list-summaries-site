    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The concept of incentivizing users to offer proof that a block has invalid content goes back to Satoshi's whitepaper, and would be useful for Alice, running an SPV client. Paul Sztorc suggests that "alerts" would be relatively straightforward and provides details on how this could work using a new OP code. He also explains how "fraud proofs" (as they are now called) require a significant engineering overhaul, and asks if anyone can point him to these problems. He outlines a proposed solution involving the creation of an OP Code called "OP FraudProof," which contains arguments such as a block number, block header, and merkle path from header to an invalid transaction. This OP Code can then be used in a transaction where Alice would provide 1 BTC and X would provide 0.2 BTC. If X signs, Alice assumes the block is invalid and stops offering to buy fraud proofs on it. If he does not sign, Alice gets her money back + 0.2 BTC from Eric for wasting her time. Paul Sztorc notes that the definition of an "invalid transaction" could be either a script which fails or a double-spend. Although he admits that this isn't a weekend project, he doesn't consider it an engineering overhaul either. Finally, he mentions that segwit may help with this solution, but he does not understand why.</p>
