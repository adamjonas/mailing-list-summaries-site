    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>After reading through the documentation, the writer doesn't believe that OpenAssets, the most popular colored coin protocol in use, has been thought out well enough to build something on top of. However, they acknowledge that it is not a work-in-progress but rather an already established protocol that cannot be changed without breaking stuff. The writer hopes that the lack of response or discussion on the project does not mean that it will become abandoned. They note that the original author, Flavien, has moved onto a private blockchain project known as OpenChain and that while others still use OpenAssets, the protocol cannot be altered. Finally, the writer mentions that there are other colored coin protocols in existence or being developed.</p>
