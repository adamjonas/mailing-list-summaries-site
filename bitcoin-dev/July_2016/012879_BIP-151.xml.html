    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 30, 2016, Erik Aronesty suggested the implementation of a PGP-like "web of trust" for the security of the bitcoin network as well as for transmission of bitcoin addresses. This proposal would allow nodes to accumulate trust over time and verify the identity of other nodes in the web. However, someone questioned if this system was already functioning this way since Bitcoin exchanges and block explorers have already earned a reputation serving the community over the years. The HTTPS certificate of these entities acts like a public/private key and is automatically checked for validity when a wallet makes a request to their server.</p>
