    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin developers' mailing list, Paul Sztorc proposed to implement "alerts," which would render transactions invalid if they referenced block content on a "pretender block." However, the issue of constructing a block for which invalidity cannot be proven remains. While proof can be shown for an invalid transaction within a well-formed block, there is no way to show proof that a block is not well-formed. This could lead to a perfectly valid block with some transactions withheld until it becomes stale, making it impossible for full nodes and miners to accept it without knowing the entire block's transactions. The only solution to this problem is for users to demand the full block from attackers, but this makes it easy for attackers to DoS users by giving them bogus incomplete-block claims. It is a major problem for those who lack the bandwidth to run a full node and rely on SPV in the first place.</p>
