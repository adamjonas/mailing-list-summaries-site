    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Zooko Wilcox suggested using the well-studied open standard of HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function) instead of re-inventing it. He recommended reading the paper about HKDF which clearly justifies each of its design decisions and is widely-understood within the cryptography community. Wilcox stated that although using a standard can sometimes result in computing something that is slightly more complicated or inefficient than a custom algorithm for a specific use case, it is still worth it to reduce the risk of both cryptographer and implementor errors. Arthur Chen agreed with Wilcox's recommendation and emphasized the importance of using open standards in cryptography. Chen is a Senior Principle Engineer and Blockchain Technologist at BTCC.</p>
