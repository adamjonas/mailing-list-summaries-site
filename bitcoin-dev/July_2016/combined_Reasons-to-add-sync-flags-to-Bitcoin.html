        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposed idea is to introduce a "sync flag" that would act like the starting flag at a race, causing all miners to simultaneously begin hashing the next block. The sync flag message consists of the hash of the previous block, Bitcoin address, and nonce. This idea has several benefits including improving mining decentralization, reducing variance in mining profitability, reducing or eliminating SPV mined blocks and empty blocks, making transaction stuffing by miners either obvious or costly, giving miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions to appear, and allowing for more efficient price discovery mechanism for transactions. A soft fork can easily implement this without requiring any forks.However, concerns were raised about selfish mining of flags by big miners who could withhold them until the advantage gained from doing so is less than the mining reward. To combat this, a proposal was made to add mandatory empty blocks, where Proof-of-Work (PoW) targeted at 2 minutes would give a flag every 2 minutes and a block every 8 minutes. But, a soft fork to add this rule would divert 20% of its hashing power to flag blocks, which would be ignored by legacy nodes, requiring the soft fork to win the race with 55% of the hashing power.The implementation of sync flags using a soft fork can be done by introducing a rule that every block must include a transaction which pays 25% of the block reward to the address given by the 10th previous sync flag and commits to the hash of the 1st previous sync flag. The author of the proposal has created a repository for sync_flags and has made some changes to it, which can be found in the repo.Sync flags have several benefits, including reducing variance in mining profitability, reducing or eliminating SPV mined blocks, reducing or eliminating empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage, reducing the latency bottleneck on throughput, making transaction stuffing by miners either obvious or costly, and giving miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions to appear. Transactions paying high fees would have time to arrive at the marketplace, rather than taking whatever is offered because all the "good" transactions got taken in the prior block.There is a proposed strategy to reduce the impact of a block-with-valid-header-but-invalid-transactions-spam-attack by using sync flags. The key to the strategy is to relax the requirement that a flag commit to a completely valid block, instead requiring only a valid block header. Miners can commence mining a flag as soon as they obtain a valid block header and can choose to abandon or continue mining the flag if spam is discovered. This approach neutralizes the harm done by the attack and incorporates the work done to produce the spam into the blockchain cumulative Proof of Work, without payment to the spammer.</p>
