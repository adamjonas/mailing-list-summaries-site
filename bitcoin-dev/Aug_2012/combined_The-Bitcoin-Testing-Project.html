        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Steve suggests the creation of a small starter suite of tests that can be incorporated into Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and shown to the community. He recommends using the Bettermeans platform to facilitate the process of creating, reviewing, and updating tests, despite having encountered issues with it losing work. Steve provides links to his existing work, including general acceptance tests and installation and wallet tests, as well as a wiki space he has been utilizing. He acknowledges that the terminology he used needs improvement and expresses an interest in keeping the tests informal, although he recognizes that this contradicts their purpose. To reduce the need for vetting tests, Steve proposes emulating Bettermeans' BIP and voting mechanism.In response to Steve's message, Gary suggests the creation of a starter suite of tests for the blockchain and proposes incorporating them through BIPs, ensuring that they are thoroughly reviewed and updated before being included in a reference. Steve proposes using Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) as a platform for testing, citing its versatility and industry-standard status. He draws a comparison between the testing process for Bitcoin and that of games in the gaming industry. Steve believes that publishing TRC/TCR tests will allow third-party developers to assess their compatibility with the blockchain and previous/future versions. He shares his experience in setting up a Microsoft Xbox European certification department, establishing QA departments, conducting testing cycles on military spec comms equipment, and identifying vulnerabilities in software such as Office, Quicktime, IE, and FF.Steve expresses a desire to move away from Bettermeans and adopt a voting/hierarchy style from Bettermeans for Mantis and test workflow. He discloses that he suffers from fast-cycling type two bipolar disorder but assures that he manages it well with medication. Additionally, Steve holds SCE clearance and mentions having a full MSDN and Technet license, along with various machines that can be used for automated testing and testing different setups.</p>
