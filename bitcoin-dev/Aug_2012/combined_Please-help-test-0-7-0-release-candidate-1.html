        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin has released version 0.7.0 release candidate 1 binaries for download. Users are requested to report bugs using the issue tracker. The release includes additions to the Qt GUI, implementation of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, JSON-RPC API support, P2P networking, internal codebase and miscellaneous improvements. Notable changes include safety checks and tray-notifications added to the UI RPC console/debug window. Two labels have been added to the overview page that displays wallet and transaction status. Sign/verify message has been merged into a single window with tabbed UI. Error reporting during start-up has been improved. Tray icon menu has been reorganized into a more logical order. Polling for balance change is now persistent when the number of blocks changed. The translations have been significantly improved, and IPv6 support and raw transaction API have been added. In P2P networking, IPv6 support, Tor hidden service support, and attempts to fix "stuck blockchain download" problems have been added. BDB database "addr.dat" has been replaced with internally-managed "peers.dat" file containing peer address data. Lower default send buffer from 10MB to 1MB and proxy SOCKS5 is now the default. Bash programmable completion for bitcoind(1) has been added. On supported OS's, each thread is given a useful name. The release has been made possible by the contributions of several people.</p>
