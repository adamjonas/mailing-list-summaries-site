    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There have been discussions about adding extra functionality to the core Bitcoin network, but it is likely that there will be pushback against this idea. Instead, people may choose to reuse the code with different peer discovery seeds and bootstrap similar but unrelated P2P networks for new applications. For example, if someone wanted to create a language translation app, they would need a way to floodfill broadcast invalid transactions to interested parties. The pubsub mechanism in the Bitcoin protocol was an interesting way to do this, but it has since been removed. To broadcast to interested nodes now, one would have to find them via addr broadcasts and then connect directly. In this case, it might make more sense to form an entirely independent network.Overall, more elaboration of the use cases for additional functionality could be helpful in determining whether or not it should be added to the core Bitcoin network.</p>
