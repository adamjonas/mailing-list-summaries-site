    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Stefan, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has created a standardized way to announce custom protocol extensions without using up NODE_* flags. He noticed that the current mechanism for enabling nodes to announce services only provides one of the 64 bits of the services field, which is a resource that will quickly run out if everyone helps themselves. Stefan's solution can be found on his BIP draft page on the Bitcoin wiki. The solution was refined with feedback from Amir Taaki, Mike Hearn, and Pieter Wuille. Earlier drafts of this BIP contained a description of a mechanism for peer exchange for these custom services, which was rather complex. Therefore, Stefan and Amir agreed to split it off into a separate BIP that will be refined further and submitted later.</p>
