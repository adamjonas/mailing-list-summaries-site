    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille has suggested allocating an extra service bit for the memory pool refill command. Currently, it is enabled by checking two "version" message attributes: Protocol version greater than or equal to 60002 and NODE_NETWORK bit set in nServices. BitcoinJS will implement the feature as it's useful and no reason not to support it. A suggestion was made to use a new inv_type for MSG_MEMTX that can help save a few milliseconds by querying the right storage right away, and also help with things like telling apart broadcast/relayed transactions from the response to a mempool request for purposes like DoS scoring. The clients would treat MSG_TX and MSG_MEMTX interchangeably. Another comment suggests that if a node doesn't have anything in its mempool, instead of sending back an empty inv message, it should respond with an inv message containing a single element of type MSG_MEMTX and hash 0. This would be a direct way to indicate that this response is associated with a mempool request. The author emphasizes that sometimes Bitcoin's protocol leaves out a lot of information not for space reasons, but because the reference client's implementation doesn't need it and making the protocol richer might help some implementation down the road make a neat optimization.</p>
