        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin developers are preparing to release a new version of the software that will contain several small modifications. Among the changes are updates to translations, address groupings RPC, and extended 'getdata' behavior. The team is aiming for an "Early Release, Early Often" approach to the checkpoint release. Jeff Garzik suggested that the team should release a new version of Bitcoin before any major landmarks features were implemented. Despite the lack of significant changes, the new release contained several small modifications that would make it useful. Garzik noted that this was an excellent opportunity for the team to create a checkpoint release. Geir H. Hansen proposed two possible new features: options to limit block sizes and prioritize paid versus free transactions. He also suggested that the bitcoin-qt GUI could be updated to make it more obvious to users why they might not see new transactions in their wallets. On August 11, 2012, Hansen shared that the most common support request at his pool was users withdrawing coins but not seeing it in their wallet because it was not up-to-date with the block chain. To mitigate this issue, a red "(out of sync)" warning has been added to the balances for version 0.7 of bitcoin-qt GUI. However, due to the protocol's design, there is a large variance in block timings which makes it impossible to determine the up-to-date status with certainty. Therefore, a safety margin of 90 minutes is used, and the warning is shown when the last received block was generated more than 90 minutes ago.Developers have suggested several improvements that could be included in the 0.7 release, including adding node optimization, parallelization opportunities, and optional IPv6 support. Some changes may not make it to the final release. Developers are encouraged to contribute directly to the release notes if they feel there is missing information. A draft of the release notes can be found on GitHub.Subtle changes have been made to the English base messages such as capitalization or punctuation, which can be annoying for translators. Unfortunately, there is no way to update all translations when the English base message changes but not significantly enough to trigger re-translation. Transifex does not have that option. Additionally, there were new duplicated strings. However, duplicate strings are not a problem since some strings are used multiple times in the program and appear multiple times in the translation because there are cases in which a string that is the same in English is translated differently in another language based on the context.Finally, in an email conversation between Wladimir and Geir, Wladimir explains that duplicate strings are not problematic in translations because some strings are used multiple times in the program but may be translated differently based on context. They also discuss using UPnP to map the listening port in bitcoin-qt, and Wladimir adds a red warning in the balances when the block chain is out of date in version 0.7 of bitcoin-qt to prevent confusion.</p>
