    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There have been subtle changes made to the English base messages such as capitalization or punctuation, which can be annoying for translators. Unfortunately, there is no way to update all translations when the English base message changes but not significantly enough to trigger re-translation. Transifex does not have that option. Additionally, there were new duplicated strings. However, duplicate strings are not a problem since some strings are used multiple times in the program and appear multiple times in the translation because there are cases in which a string that is the same in English is translated differently in another language based on the context. Qt translator fills duplicates in automatically with the option to change them if desired. It is unclear whether Transifex has the same option. Two messages about using UPnP to map the listening port seem odd. The default depends on compiler flags, hence the two messages. The message could be split up so that "Use UPnP to map the listening port" is factored out. This change will be made after 0.7.0 release since all existing translations for those messages will be broken if done earlier. There should be no more message changes before the release unless there is a very good reason.</p>
