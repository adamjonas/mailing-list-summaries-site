    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 2, 2012, Jeff Garzik sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list proposing a checkpoint release for Bitcoin. He stated that there was no major landmark feature but a useful collection of small changes which made it a good time to Release Early, Release Often. However, he also noted that since Gavin Andresen, one of the core developers, was on vacation, the release obviously wouldn't occur for at least a couple of weeks. Gavin Andresen responded to this proposal stating that he had no objections to a rc1 happening before he returned and if other developers were happy with it, he might be convinced to let them go ahead with 0.7-rc1. The email also included a note from Jeff Garzik promoting a Live Security Virtual Conference covering all the ways today's security and threat landscape has changed and how IT managers can respond.</p>
