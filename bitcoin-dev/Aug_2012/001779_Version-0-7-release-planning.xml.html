    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on August 11, 2012, Geir Harald Hansen shared that the most common support request at his pool was users withdrawing coins but not seeing it in their wallet because it was not up-to-date with the block chain. He suggested adding a feature to the bitcoin-qt GUI to make it more obvious to users why they can't see new transactions. The bitcoin-qt also delays showing generation until 2 confirms.There were two settings mentioned which seemed odd: "Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)" and "Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 1 when listening)." However, it was explained that the default depends on build options so the statement is correct.</p>
