    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Steve, Gary suggests creating a starter suite of tests for the blockchain and proposing a process through BIPs to allow for the creation, review, and updating of tests before being incorporated into a reference. Steve proposes using MantisBT as a platform for testing, citing its versatility and industry-standard status, and compares the testing of Bitcoin to that of games in the gaming industry. He believes that publishing TRC/TCR tests will allow third-party developers to see how they fare with the blockchain and ensure compatibility with previous/future versions. Steve also shares his experience in setting up a Microsoft Xbox European cert department, setting up QA departments, testing cycles on military spec comms equipment, and finding exploits in software like Office, Quicktime, IE, FF, etc. He expresses a desire to move away from Bettermeans and use a voting/hierarchy style from Bettermeans and apply it to Mantis and test workflow. Lastly, Steve discloses that he suffers from fast-cycling type two bipolar disorder, but has been managing it well, and holds SCE clearance.</p>
