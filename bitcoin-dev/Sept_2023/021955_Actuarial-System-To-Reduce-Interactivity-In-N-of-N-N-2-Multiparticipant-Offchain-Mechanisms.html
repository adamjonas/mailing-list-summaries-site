    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the topic of loose interactivity and the need for `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` in a specific context. It is mentioned that the actuary is always online and can gather signatures for the next state while signing new transactions on top of it. The purpose of `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` is to allow transactions on top of the next state to spend either the actual next state or the current state plus additional transactions. This flexibility is important in case the next state fails to get fully signed and the participants decide to give up on it. There is a suggestion mentioned in the email that participants other than the actuary could generate a single public key known by all participants. However, this approach raises concerns as only one sockpuppet of the actuary would be needed to add to the participant set. The main challenge highlighted in the email is that the actuary needs to bond a significant amount of funds to each participant, which is not part of the funding of the construction.The email concludes by asking if there are any other ways to ensure single-use besides `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`. The sender requests information or suggestions from the recipient regarding this matter.Note: The farewell part of the email has been ignored in the summary.</p>
