    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Based on the information provided in the email, it seems that there is a discussion about the safety of dedicated user `B` creating something without obtaining a signature from `A_i`. The author suggests that if the funding for this project comes solely from `B`, it may not be safe unless it receives a signature from `A_i`. The email mentions that if a particular `A_i` does not contact `B` but still confirms the entire path from the funding transaction output to the `A_i && B` output, the funds allocated by `B` will be locked unless `B` obtains a unilateral close signature from `A_i` to spend from `A_i && B`.The author also mentions that `A_i` needs to be online when `B` signs the funding transaction that anchors the entire tree. Failure to do so may result in the loss of funds, as seen with the implementation of `multifundchannel` by others. It is important to ensure that all counterparties in the same batch of openings have given unilateral close signatures before broadcasting the funding transaction.Another alternative discussed is infecting the leaf itself with a lifetime `(A_i && B) || (B && CLTV)`, which is described as a Spilman channel variant used in swap-in-potentiam. In this scenario, `B` can dedicate the leaf output to a separate transaction that spends from the `(A_i && B)` branch and sends to a plain `A && B` Lightning channel. `B` can fund the tree, and when `A_i` comes online and agrees to accept the channel from `B`, `A_i` creates two signatures: one for the transaction spending `(A_i && B) || (B && CLTV)` and another for the unilateral close transaction from the aforementioned output.In conclusion, this email discusses the importance of obtaining a signature from `A_i` for the safety of a project, the need for `A_i` to be online when `B` signs the funding transaction, and the alternative approach of using a Spilman channel variant.</p>
