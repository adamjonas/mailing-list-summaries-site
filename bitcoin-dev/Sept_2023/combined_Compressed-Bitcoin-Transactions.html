        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the email, Tom informs Jonas that he is updating the code to match the documentation and expects to finish before the end of the week. He mentions that 100 blocks is considered safe from reorg, similar to the policy for spending coin base transactions. In the PR, Tom adds a compressrawtransaction RPC endpoint with a built-in limit and warning for uncompressed TxId. He plans to add this information to the documentation as well.Fabian replies to Tom's email and suggests adding size numbers (vs plain, vs gzip) for better understanding. He also proposes adding a definition to the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to clarify when not to use height/index due to the risk of reorgs, similar to BIP136.In another email exchange between Fabian and Tom, they discuss the encoding of a prefix tree and its space requirements compared to using block height and transaction index. They mention removing vout from the encoding and flattening it to an index over all transactions and their outputs. They consider reducing the number of bits required for block height by having a bit indicate whether it is over a certain threshold. However, they decide against indexing all txos due to extra requirements for the decompressor and potential complications. They also discuss the complexity of implementing a new index and the space savings expected from their compression schema.Andrew responds to Tom's post and thanks him for his efforts in the research and implementation. He suggests creating a chart to demonstrate the compression strength of the application. Andrew acknowledges that analyzing historical data or average transactions may not provide accurate numbers for this specific application. He recommends including uncompressed/compressed sizes for various transaction types, such as a 2-in-2-out wpkh transaction and a 2-in-2-out Taproot transaction. He also suggests including numbers for p2sh-wpkh and p2pkh, even though they are less common. Andrew signs off with his contact information and a quote about the sun always shining in space.Overall, Tom has been working on a compression schema for bitcoin transactions, providing updates and receiving feedback from Jonas, Fabian, and Andrew. The emails discuss the progress, potential improvements, and suggestions for further analysis and documentation.</p>
