    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the BIP70 protocol and its support of zero value outputs. The original poster, Toby Padilla, argues that allowing zero value OP_RETURN outputs would benefit merchants and developers by enabling transactions with keyless environments. Luke Dashjr disagrees with this proposal, stating that it would encourage spam and make users unwilling participants in it. Andreas Schildbach points out that BIP70 currently does not ignore zero outputs and allows them as an indication for setting an amount. However, Bitcoin Core will reject any output with zero value, including OP_RETURN outputs. Toby Padilla plans to clean up the language in his BIP proposal, but Luke Dashjr advises against publishing or implementing it. He argues that it is better for spammers to lose burned bitcoins than to allow a way to avoid them. Luke also suggests that the proposed changes are not backward or forward compatible and implementing either would result in severe consequences.</p>
