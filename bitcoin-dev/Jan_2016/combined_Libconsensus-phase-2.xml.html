        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Developer Jorge Timón has laid out a plan to decouple libconsensus from Bitcoin Core in multiple phases. In the second phase, all consensus critical code will be built within the existing libconsensus library. This will be followed by Phase 3, which will refine the storage interfaces and focus on a quasi-final C API. Phase 4 involves renaming files to the target directory and moving remaining unused code out of libconsensus. Finally, in Phase 5, Bitcoin Core will use libbitcoinconsensus only by its generic C API.Timón also plans to create an issue to move all the necessary files one by one. He has explained that a public blockchain interface will exist in the second phase of development, which will be a C++ interface that fits better with Bitcoin Core internals. The storage interface will be refined in the third phase using structs of function pointers instead of classes.The objective is to decouple the consensus code from chain.o and coins.o so they don't get built as part of the consensus building package used for building both libbitcoinconsensus and Bitcoin Core. Timón believes implementing both versions of libbitcoinconsensus is acceptable, and prefers allowing alternative implementations with custom storage.In a conversation with Eric Voskuil, Timón explained that an interface will exist to isolate the database dependency from consensus critical code, but it will be a C++ interface that fits better with Bitcoin Core internals. He also shared an initial draft of the storage interface and mentioned that faithful reproduction of stored data is a prerequisite for consensus validity, but forcing users to a given uniform storage will likely have fewer users.In terms of moving files, it is a simple task that can be easily accomplished without much hassle. There are various ways to move files, including drag-and-drop, cut-and-paste, and copy-and-paste methods. However, users should exercise caution and follow proper procedures to ensure that the files are moved correctly and safely. It is important to double-check the file names and locations, as well as making sure that the files are not currently in use or open in any applications.</p>
