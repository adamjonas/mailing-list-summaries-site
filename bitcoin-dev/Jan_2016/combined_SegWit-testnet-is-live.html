        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>BitGo, a digital asset security platform, has successfully implemented Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions for Bitcoin. They are now waiting for the activation of SegWit on the Bitcoin network before offering support to their customers. Other companies such as BlockCypher and Breadwallet have also committed to supporting SegWit transactions in the near future. SegWit is expected to bring several benefits to the Bitcoin network, including increased capacity and improved transaction malleability.In December 2015, Eric Lombrozo announced the successful running of a segregated witness testnet called segnet. This testnet has rudimentary wallets with support already implemented. Several wallets, including mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin, have committed to supporting SegWit. Breadwallet has also joined in supporting segwit. More wallets are expected to add their support soon.Interested wallet developers can contact Eric Lombrozo for development and testing on segnet. The source code for segnet can be found at sipa's Github repository, and an example signing code is available at Eric's Github repository. SegWit is expected to enable fundamental improvements to bitcoin, and its implementation is on schedule.</p>
