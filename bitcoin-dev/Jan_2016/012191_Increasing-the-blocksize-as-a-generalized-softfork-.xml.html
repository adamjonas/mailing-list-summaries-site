    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent on December 20, 2015 at 10:56:33 AM, a user named joe2015--- via bitcoin-dev proposed the idea of a "generalized" softfork. In response to this proposal, Luke-Jr, another user in the Bitcoin community, stated that he had also been planning to propose a similar concept, which he referred to as a "soft hardfork" or "softserve hardfork". However, Luke-Jr noted that he had not yet released his proposal as a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) due to the lack of a defensive reaction plan for those who may wish to reject the hardfork. He expressed the need to prioritize this aspect of the proposal before releasing it as a BIP.</p>
