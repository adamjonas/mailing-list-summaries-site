    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 18, 2016, Wladimir J. van der Laan announced the first binary release that contained block pruning functionality, which had been tested in git for almost half a year. Though he stated it was highly unlikely that the wallet would eat coins, he advised users to backup their wallets regardless. The previous v0.11.0 release notes stated that block pruning was incompatible with running a wallet because block data was used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or addresses, but this limitation was expected to be lifted in the near future. The user who sent the email inquired about whether the limitation had been lifted and if the feature was considered complete, stating that the disk space reduction was a significant benefit.</p>
