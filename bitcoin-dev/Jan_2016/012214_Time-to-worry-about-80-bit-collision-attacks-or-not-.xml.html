    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo had expressed concerns over the vulnerability of anything that uses P2SH to an attack on RIPEMD160, which may lead to reduced security. However, this claim has been disputed, and it has been pointed out that even if a collision could be generated in RIPEMD160, it wouldn't help as one would still need to create a specific SHA256 hash for the RIPEMD160 preimage. Furthermore, a preimage attack would only be useful if it led to more than one preimage quite cheaply, which isn't possible with MD4. Although economically viable attacks are expected in 20 years, Rusty suggests keeping things simple for now by having all SW scriptPubKeys simply be "RIPEMD(SHA256(WP))". However, he acknowledges that this isn't a no-brainer. To calculate the cost of building bitcoin-network-level compute, Rusty assumes that collision in 19 days would cost $1B to build today. If there were to be 100 million dollars a day in vulnerable txs, and you're on one end of all of them (or can MITM if you find a collision), *and* can delay them all by 10 seconds, and none are in parallel so you can attack all of them, then a machine would have a 0.11% chance of finding a collision in 1 hour, which is worth about $110,000. This machine could be built for that in approximately 20 years.</p>
