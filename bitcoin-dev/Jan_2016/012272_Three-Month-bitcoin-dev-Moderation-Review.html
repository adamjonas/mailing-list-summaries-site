    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, contributors were discussing the importance of providing unique and valuable contributions to conversations. It was suggested that comments should contribute to the discussion with technical discussion or additional relevant data. A simple +1 without any added explanation was deemed unhelpful and not useful. The goal is to provide readers with another thing to consider in favor of something beyond just the number of people who support it. The sentiment expressed was that evidence trumps votes. Additionally, Gavin, a contributor to the thread, offered his services as a techie for those in need and shared information about his projects Litmocracy and Meme Racing, both of which are currently in alpha.</p>
