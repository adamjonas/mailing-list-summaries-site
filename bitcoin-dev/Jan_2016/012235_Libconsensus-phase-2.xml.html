    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent mailing list post, developer jtimon discusses their plan to fully decouple libconsensus from Bitcoin Core in several phases. The initial plan of exposing one more thing at a time was changed after realizing it would slow things down, and instead the goal of phase 2 is now to build all the consensus critical code within the existing libconsensus library. This will make it much simpler to expose VerifyHeader(), VerifyTx() and VerifyBlock() in the future. Phase 3 will refine the storage interfaces and focus on a quasi-final C API, while Phase 4 will rename files to the target directory and move remaining unused code out of libconsensus. In Phase 5, Bitcoin Core will use libbitcoinconsensus only by its generic C API. The work in progress branch can be found on GitHub, and jtimon plans to create an issue to move all the necessary files one by one. They encourage others to become involved in moving files as it is a simple task that can easily be done correctly.</p>
