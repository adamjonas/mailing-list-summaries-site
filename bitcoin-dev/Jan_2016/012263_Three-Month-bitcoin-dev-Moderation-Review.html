    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of bitcoin-dev, Dave Scotese, expressed disappointment at the difficulty in accessing moderated messages. He suggested having a downloadable version of these messages on the ozlabs website to contain the text of the moderated emails. However, Rusty explained that the reason for the difficulty in retrieving the messages is because they are forwarded to the bitcoin-dev-moderation mailing list which strips them out as attachments. Rusty also expressed his desire for a filter to be developed to address this issue and called for volunteers to help with this task.</p>
