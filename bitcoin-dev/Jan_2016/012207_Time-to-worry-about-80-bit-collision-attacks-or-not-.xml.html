    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Pieter Wuille and Gavin Andresen, dated January 7th, 2016, is about the use of cryptography in Bitcoin. Pieter requests that the cryptography used in Bitcoin should be up to par with security standards instead of relying on economic arguments for security or privacy. He suggests that using better cryptography would improve security levels. In response, Gavin asks for clarification regarding the incremental increase in security of SHA256(SHA256) over RIPEMD160(SHA256), compared to having a simpler implementation of SegWit. He argues that implementation errors and side-channel attacks are more common than brute-force breaks in computer security. He also points out that a public key for C must be known if an attacker wants to burn the funds, after doing an 80-bit search for B and C such that H(A and B) = H(B and C).</p>
