    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated January 8, 2016, Gavin Andresen discussed the tradeoff between crypto strength and code complexity in relation to segwitness. He explained that segwitness would help scale in the short term and highlighted two ways of stuffing the segwitness hash into the scriptPubKey. One way used a 32-bit hash but would make scalability worse while the other added just one byte to the scriptpubkey. Gavin suggested it was better to always move the script into the witness data to keep the design as simple as possible principle. He admitted that using a 32-byte hash could compromise the short-term scalability goal, but he still believed it was a no-brainer.</p>
