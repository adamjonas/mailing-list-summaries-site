    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author argues that attempts to identify individuals in Bitcoin are futile and destructive. The idea of measuring consensus is supported, with proto-ideas on how this could be achieved. A simple method for measuring consensus is proposed, based on signed messages from holders of BTC agreeing on a condition. Luke Dashjr provides criticism of a proposal for committees to review and indicate acceptance of BIPs, suggesting instead a specification based on BIP 123 that establishes conditions under which a proposal is known to be accepted by the community. He also questions the requirement for 1% stake for each segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem, citing privacy violations and time consumption. The proposal for a BIP process manager is also questioned. The author provides information about their experience and skills as a techie.</p>
