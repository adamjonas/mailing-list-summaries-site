        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread from January 29, 2016, discusses the impact of a fork occurring during the difficulty period. In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jannes Faber raised concerns about the effects of a hard (or soft) fork on non-upgraded clients, particularly with regard to the 2016 blocks recalibration window. Gavin Andresen responded by saying it doesn't matter where in the difficulty period the fork happens, as the lower-power fork's difficulty will adjust a little quicker if it happens in the middle. However, he acknowledged that this was an unrealistic scenario, with there being no more than single-digit percentages of hash power on a minority fork, which would lead to significant delays and difficulty adjustments lasting months before normal block times are resumed. Andresen also referred to his blog post on minority branches, which explains why miners have little incentive to mine on a minority fork.In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jannes Faber questioned what would happen to the remaining 1% chain if a non-contentious hard fork was implemented. Peter Todd replied with his thoughts on the risks of hard forks and suggested that activation thresholds for hard forks should be above 99%, measured over a multi-week timespan. Todd also mentioned that high activation thresholds could always be soft-forked down after the fact, and that there is little harm in delaying the fork by two or three months if stragglers won't upgrade. He added that hard forks should not be controversial for good social/political reasons anyway, and that there may be exceptions in very rare cases like security issues. Todd's "Soft Forks Are Safer Than Hard Forks" post from the previous week explains the technical risks for deploying non-controversial forks.The writer is seeking clarification about the effects of hard (or soft) forks, specifically related to the timing of implementing new rules and how it affects non-updated clients. They suggest four options for when to apply new rules, all relating to the 2016 blocks recalibration window. The writer considers the potential consequences of each option, particularly in case of a contentious 75-25 hard fork, where option 4 would be best for the conservative chain. They also consider scenarios where it may be beneficial for the remaining 1% chain to never reach 2016 blocks again. The writer questions whether all possible scenarios have been considered and suggests defining the best choice as mandatory for any hard fork proposal, possibly through BIP9. The writer acknowledges that the first few blocks mined after implementing new rules may not follow the new guidelines.The email thread from January 29, 2016, discusses the impact of a fork occurring during the difficulty period. The BIP9 only checks for new activations during difficulty retargettings as an optimization to only check 1/2016 of the blocks. However, it is not assumed that this will be the case for all implementations. BIP99 recommends a 95% activation threshold for uncontroversial rule changes and no miner signaling at all for controversial hardforks. The proposal includes a manageable list of simple fixes like the timewarp fix forward-ported from Freicoin 0.8. There has not been much interest in growing the short list of easy-to-implement changes. BIP99 has not received any opposition as a hardfork proposal, but it is not considered a priority to work on at this moment. It may be classified as a BIP without code, and the hardfork proposal itself should have been a separate one.</p>
