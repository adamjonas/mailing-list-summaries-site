        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The ongoing Bitcoin block size debate has prompted developers to discuss potential solutions. One proposal, BIP100, allows for miners to vote on the block size. However, Warren Togami Jr. argues that this approach is not optimal because it does not align with the marginal cost of the entire flood network. Instead, Togami suggests a flex cap mechanism that allows for an actual cost associated with a vote and enables block size growth based on actual demand.Another proposal from Luzius Meisser involves only paying out 10% of collected fees in a block to the miner and adding the remaining 90% to the collected fees of the next block. This creates a rolling average of collected fees from current and past blocks. Meisser also proposes a flex cap solution where miners can buy additional space for an exponentially increasing fee. The purchased space's price is subtracted from the collected fees and added to the reward of the next block. The amount spent on additional space allows for the calculation of their marginal costs per transaction.Togami argues against mandatory sharing, as miners can take payment out-of-band and confirm the transaction with little or no visible fees in the block. Every 1000 blocks, the basic cap is adjusted upwards or downwards depending on whether the average fees per KB were above or below the global cost estimate. Togami believes that a holistic analysis is necessary to understand the benefits of running a full node. Increasing block sizes can make it more attractive to run a full node, depending on the circumstances.To incentivize decentralization and support the establishment of a free fee market, the author proposes to smooth the payout of fees across blocks. By only paying out a fraction of collected fees and adding the remaining amount to the next block's fees, the payout to the miner becomes a rolling average of collected fees from current and past blocks. This aligns the incentives of individual miners with those of the whole network, reducing the marginal benefit of including an additional transaction into a block by an order of magnitude. This approach reduces the disadvantage of mining with a slow connection and is a step towards a free fee market.However, concerns are raised about increasing orphan risk and the reduction of rewards. Other suggestions include smoothing fees between the current and subsequent 5 blocks and adjusting the basic cap upwards or downwards depending on average fees per KB every 1000 blocks. Nonetheless, touching anything related to fee distribution is a political minefield, and this proposal probably requires a hard fork. Its technical feasibility was only superficially verified, and the author plans to specify/implement the idea more formally if it is received well.</p>
