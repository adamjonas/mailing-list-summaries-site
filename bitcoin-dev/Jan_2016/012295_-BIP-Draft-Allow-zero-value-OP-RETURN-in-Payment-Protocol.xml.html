    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, two individuals are discussing the use of OP_RETURN in Bitcoin transactions. The first person argues that not all applications of OP_RETURN should be considered spam and that burning the value is not a deterrent. The second person argues that burning the coins is better than allowing it to be gratis and that the lack of a key during construction of zero value OP_RETURNs is a good thing as it makes spam more difficult. They also discuss the use of BIP70 and how it allows for the construction of transactions on another machine without needing a key during construction. However, the first person believes that there is a better alternative to burning coins and encoding data and questions why it should be allowed when there is an alternative option available. Despite their differences, both agree that spam should not be made easier or cheaper.</p>
