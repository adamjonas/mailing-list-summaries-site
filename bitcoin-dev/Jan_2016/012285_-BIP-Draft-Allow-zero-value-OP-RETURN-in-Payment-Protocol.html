    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 26, 2016, Toby Padilla sent a message to Luke regarding the encoding of data on the blockchain. While Luke suggested that supporting OP_RETURN in PaymentRequests was unnecessary, Toby argued that it was important due to the fact that some people may use worse methods for encoding data. However, Luke did not see how this applied to PaymentRequests.Toby also mentioned that he was unaware of how one could construct a transaction with a zero value OP_RETURN without keys in an environment without keys. He explained that implementing a custom transaction and executing it within the same application would require a key. Luke did not understand what Toby meant by this statement.</p>
