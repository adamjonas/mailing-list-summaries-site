        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach suggested that the discussion about SegWit should be kept within the #bitcoin-dev channel to avoid fragmentation of communication channels. Bryan agreed, stating that although it may be necessary to create a new channel if the discussion becomes overwhelming, it would be preferable to keep it within the existing venue.In response to this, Eric Lombrozo has created a new IRC channel called #segwit-dev. This channel is specifically dedicated to integrating and supporting segregated witness transactions in wallets, as well as providing a platform for comments and suggestions to improve the spec. Eric extended an invitation to all members of the bitcoin-dev community who share the objective of this channel.However, some members expressed concerns about fragmenting the communication channels and associated infrastructure, such as logs and bots. They argued that discussions related to SegWit should take place in the #bitcoin-dev channel instead. Eric has informed the community about the creation of the new IRC channel, #segwit-dev, emphasizing its purpose of discussing segregated witness transactions and soliciting feedback on the spec. He encourages everyone to join the channel and actively participate in the discussions.</p>
