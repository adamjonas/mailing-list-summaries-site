    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a new BIP process has been suggested, which aims to include more voices and gain a clearer idea of acceptance than the current process allows. The proposed process would work alongside the existing one, not replace it. A committee would determine acceptance by taking opinions in aggregate, and the source of their indication may be similar to what is currently used. The committee structures would be fluid, allowing users to reorganize at any time. The proposed process would make it clear when only part of the community decides to adopt a BIP that doesn't require consensus, that they are going against the acceptance of the rest of the community. Bitcoin's user base and economic activity are unknown, but suggestions have been made for honest but anonymous voting mechanisms. The flaws in the proposal have been noted, but the process could be used to determine how miners express their positions. Conditions for activation of the process must succeed by its own rules, with at least a 4% sample of the Bitcoin community represented, and at least one committee in each segment included.</p>
