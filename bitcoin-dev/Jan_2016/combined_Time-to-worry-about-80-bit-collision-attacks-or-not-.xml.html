        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the security of witness programs. The debate has centered around Gavin Andresen's proposal to use an 80-bit hash function for witness programs versus Pieter Wuille and others' argument in favor of maintaining a 128-bit security target. There was also discussion around the use of collision attacks and a proposal to use RIPEMD160(SHA256(script)) as the single witness program version. Andresen criticized the "Here's the spec, take it or leave it" attitude and argued for simplicity in the design of the program. However, technical details were discussed about how attackers could create two scripts with the same hash result, and the potential risks of implementing multiple ways of interpreting the segwitness hash in the scriptPubKey.Another topic of discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list was the security of RIPEMD160, which is used in Bitcoin's P2SH and P2PKH. Gavin Andresen suggested sticking to the current status quo and using RIPEMD160 for these purposes. However, Ethan Heilman warned that collisions can be found with targeted substrings and length extension attacks, even if an attacker can only create two random values that collide. Heilman provided an algorithm to demonstrate this vulnerability and questioned the effectiveness of Merkle-Damgard strengthening against length extension attacks.The use of RIPEMD160(SHA256()) was also discussed, with some uncertainty over whether cascading RIPEMD160(SHA256()) is weaker than using HMAC. The potential for collision attacks in contract setups was highlighted as a concern, emphasizing the need for collision security measures.In the context of using RIPEMD160 as a hash function for segregated witness, the question of its collision resistance was raised. While Gavin Andresen suggested that RIPEMD160(SHA256()) could be used, Pieter Wuille raised concerns about 80-bit collision resistance. Pieter argued that an attacker could use a collision attack to construct scripts with identical hashes and steal coins. However, Gavin believed that the risk is low and stated that adding extra bytes to every segwit to prevent the attack is not worth the tradeoff.It was noted that collision attacks against RIPEMD160 would require at least O(2^80) CPU, which is feasible but also requires O(2^80) storage, which is infeasible even with the entire world's storage capacity. Matt Corallo added that collisions only take 2**80 work if the hash is theoretically perfect, which is never the case, and collision resistance often starts to get easier long before anyone is truly worried about the security of the hash function.</p>
