    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to modify BIP70 has been put forward that would allow for the use of OP_RETURN metadata in a keyless environment. The proposal is based on the idea that people will encode data onto the blockchain using worse methods than OP_RETURN, which was originally introduced as a means to stop spam. However, Luke Dashjr has advised against implementing the proposal, stating his concern that it would encourage spam and make users unwilling (and possibly unaware) participants in it. He also questioned the relevance of the proposal to keys. The proposed change to BIP70 would see outputs with zero value being accepted by the wallet, and those with greater than zero rejected. This contrasts with current requirements under BIP70 where all zero value outputs are ignored.</p>
