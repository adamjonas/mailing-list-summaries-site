    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 46, Luke Dashjr noted that it was missing from the repository but had apparently been self-assigned by Tier Nolan in a previous email. Dashjr suggested that if the proposal had been assigned officially or if Nolan was still interested in pursuing it, it would make sense to just keep it at BIP 46. However, Nolan responded saying that he was never officially assigned any number for the proposal and subsequent changes made the BIP obsolete. Dashjr then recommended marking the number as nonassignable to prevent confusion with archive searches, assuming that new BIP numbers would be greater than 100 anyway. Finally, Dashjr acknowledged that he should not have used a number in the original git branch before being assigned it officially.</p>
