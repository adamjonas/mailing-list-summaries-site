    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of "+1"ing and whether or not it is okay was discussed. Xor suggested that "+1"ing should be allowed as long as a technical explanation is provided for why they agree. However, Peter Todd chimed in to suggest that the technical explanation should also contribute uniquely to the conversation. He believes that a "+1" with an explanation similar to the last one given isn't useful. Overall, the discussion centered around how to foster peer review while also ensuring that the contributions made are unique and valuable to the conversation.</p>
