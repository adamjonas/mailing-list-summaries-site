    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list inquired about the status of pruning in the upcoming release of Bitcoin Core version 0.12, as it had not been explicitly mentioned in the release notes. Wladimir J. van der Laan confirmed that pruning has been tested for almost half a year and will be included in this release. However, he also noted that users should still backup their wallets as there is always a possibility of issues with syncing between the wallet and blockchain. The user expressed interest in this feature due to concerns about the amount of disk space required to run a full node. Enabling pruning remains the same process as described in the release notes for version 0.11.</p>
