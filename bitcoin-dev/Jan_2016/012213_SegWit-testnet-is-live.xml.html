    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BlockCypher and Breadwallet have both committed to supporting segregated witness (segwit), a major improvement to the Bitcoin protocol. Other wallets such as Blocktrail, GreenAddress, GreenBits, mSIGNA, and NBitcoin have also pledged their support. Eric Lombrozo announced in a Bitcoin-dev mailing list that they have been successfully running a segregated witness testnet called segnet since December 31, 2015. The testnet has implemented rudimentary wallets with support. Several wallets have already committed to supporting it including mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin. More wallets are expected to be added to this list soon. If you're a wallet dev and are interested in developing and testing on segnet please contact Eric Lombrozo.</p>
