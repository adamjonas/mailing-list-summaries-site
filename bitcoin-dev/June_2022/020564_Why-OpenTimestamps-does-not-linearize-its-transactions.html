    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on the bitcoin-dev forum raised concerns about the requirement to publicize .ots files for timestamping using the OpenTimestamps (OTS) system. However, it was clarified that publication is not a part of the OTS system. The user suggested including more cryptographic information in the original OP_RETURN to obviate the need for publicizing .ots files. Another concern raised was the possibility of a 4th party replacing an .ots file and changing the timestamp to a later time, but it was explained that timestamps cannot be replaced in the OTS system; only new timestamps can be made. The purpose of the OTS system is to prove the existence of a document at a certain time and detect any tampering that may have occurred. The discussion on the forum was related to a recent post on Hacker News.</p>
