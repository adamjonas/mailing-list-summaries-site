    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around the implementation of covenants on Bitcoin and whether or not they are contentious. Alicexbt argued that covenants will eventually be implemented with a soft fork, and CTV is the easiest and best possible way. The benefits of covenants were listed as developers being able to build interesting projects with real demand in the market, students learning Sapio and not just solidity, better tooling available for application developers, and funding of Bitcoin developers and projects improving. Billy Tetrud agreed with alicexbt and stated that there are no technical issues that have been shown. However, he recognized that the non-technical folks need time to discuss it and realize this. Misinformation was also discussed, with several examples given, including misleading tweets, personal attacks, and false information shared by social media influencers. Jorge Tim√≥n questioned who was considered "non-technical folks" and asked if alicexbt considered himself a technical folk. A discussion ensued about skillsets and qualifications, with alicexbt stating that he includes himself as a technical folk, having a degree in software engineering and working as a programmer in the Bitcoin space. Ultimately, the discussion emphasized the importance of honest opinions and an open-minded approach when reviewing proposals and making changes to Bitcoin.</p>
