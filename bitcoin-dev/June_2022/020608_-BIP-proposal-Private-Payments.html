    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bryan Bishop suggested an alternative to using OP_RETURN in notification transactions for private payments. Instead of using OP_RETURN to include a single value that only Alice and Bob can calculate, he proposed publishing the data on a Tor hidden service that other wallets can check. One issue with using OP_RETURN is that the data is put on-chain, which could compromise the privacy of those involved in the transaction. By putting the data on a hidden service, there is no on-chain footprint showing that Alice is sending a private payment, which would enhance privacy. However, Ruben Santamarta pointed out that the data on-chain is critical to accessing funds and guaranteeing their availability when restoring from backup.</p>
