    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the potential implementation of covenants on Bitcoin through a soft fork, with CTV and OP_TX being suggested as the best options. The author highlights the benefits of covenants, such as allowing developers to build interesting projects with real demand in the market and improving tooling for application developers. Additionally, funding for Bitcoin developers and projects may improve without the need to convince a few people for grants. The author argues that covenants are not contentious, despite potential drama on social media, as there are zero technical NACKs for CTV and other proposals have been discussed openly with an open-minded approach.The author suggests improving the review process for soft fork BIPs and sharing honest opinions on technical merits to avoid waiting for years for consensus or pretending changes are hard in Bitcoin. They prefer BIP 8 or improved BIP 8 for soft fork, but are open to anything that improves Bitcoin. Implementing covenants before the next cycle would provide opportunities for developers to build interesting things during bear markets. Finally, the author notes that CTV is not a rushed soft fork, as less people followed the research and it was not mentioned on social media repeatedly by respected developers like other soft forks.</p>
