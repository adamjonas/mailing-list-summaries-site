        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list recently discussed the creation of a standard for transaction package relay. The goal was to allow sending batches of transactions together, and the discussion included ideas for configuring limiting ancestors in the mempool, specifying depth and size constraints in a standard, and adding a graph to illustrate packages with dependency relationships between parents.One issue that was addressed in the discussion was the potential for bandwidth waste in nodes running with different policy rules. For example, a low-fee and non-standard transaction A could be relayed, prompting new nodes to send INV(PKGINFO1, T) to all package-relay peers. Two suggestions were proposed to mitigate this: including a hash of the package wtxids along with the wtxid of the child in the initial announcement, and limiting the use of v1 packages to transactions with very few parents.Concerns were raised about calculating shortids for every transaction in a node's mempool for package relay, which could lead to a DoS vector. To avoid reinventing the wheel, some participants suggested defining packages as compact block (BIP 152) announcements without the header field, updated protocol version, and with changes to names.The discussion also touched on the addition of new protocol messages for package relay, including the sendpackages message, which contains information about the maximum number of transactions and total weight that a node can accept in a package. Participants also debated changes to the versioning system and the overhead associated with including ancestor information in packages.Overall, the email thread addresses concerns over the reliability of peer nodes and the possibility of censorship of transactions. Relevant resources, such as BIP documents and code snippets, are linked throughout the discussion.</p>
