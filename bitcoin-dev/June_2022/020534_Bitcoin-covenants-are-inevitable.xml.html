    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is an opinion and not an attack on Bitcoin. Covenants on Bitcoin will eventually be implemented with a soft fork, with CTV being the easiest and best possible way. Apart from the technical merits, covenants will improve various aspects such as developers building interesting projects with real demand in the market, students learning Sapio, and better tooling being available for application developers. There may also be an increase in demand for block space and funding of Bitcoin developers and projects. Some people may write paragraphs about CTV being contentious, spread misinformation and do all types of drama, politics, etc. on social media, but there are zero technical NACKs for CTV. All the developers that participated in the discussion are either okay with CTV or OP_TX or covenants in general. The author believes that we should improve the review process for soft fork BIPs and share honest opinions with agreement, disagreement on technical merits. They prefer BIP 8 or improved BIP 8 for soft fork but won't mind anything else being used if that improves Bitcoin. Covenants implemented in Bitcoin before the next cycle would provide opportunities for developers to build interesting things during the bear market. Ossification supporters also believe there is some window that will close soon, so maybe doing changes considering each case individually will be a better approach. CTV is not a rushed soft fork, less people followed the research, and it was not mentioned on social media repeatedly by the respected developers like other soft forks.</p>
