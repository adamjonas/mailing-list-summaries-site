    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on June 14th, 2022, a user of bitcoin-dev expressed concern over the use of OTS for timestamping. They believe that a system with nonces in its merkle trees is being favored by spy agencies to avoid the storage of public records in a way that could be verified by anonymous and censored third parties. Andrew Poelstra responded, asking for caution with tone and assuming bad faith. After talking to others, he suggested that the issue might come down to different interpretations of "timestamping". He believes that if timestamping means proving some data existed at a particular time, then this is exactly what OTS does. However, the original user still worries that the proof is held in a document that the user must protect. They recommend uploading .ots files to chains with cheap storage such as arweave or bitcoin sv to prove which one was first when there is more than one. The user apologizes for their poor support and acknowledges the hard work put into providing OTS to the community.</p>
