    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this context emphasizes the significance of pinning a public hash to the bitcoin blockchain to protect the accuracy of history when it is not safe. The concern raised here relates to scaling, and the author thinks that Bitcoin was designed to scale better than it currently does. The quick solutions like the lightning protocol seem arbitrary, and the author believes that Bitcoin should have had a simplistically designed and well-backed decentralized propagation and storage of data. The author thinks that Bitcoin got big too fast and was intended to handle large data smoothly. However, the political issues prevented that from happening. The author also notes that other chains have made strides in this aspect. Finally, the author believes that Satoshi was not familiar with how people behave when they have a lot of money.</p>
