    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between John Carvalho and alicexbt on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around the topic of covenants on Bitcoin. Alicexbt stated that covenants will eventually be implemented with a soft fork, and CTV is the easiest and best possible way to do so. Alicexbt also mentioned the benefits of implementing covenants, such as interesting projects with real demand in the market, better tooling for application developers, and improved funding for bitcoin developers and projects. John Carvalho objected to the idea of implementing covenants, stating that it is not justifiable simply because a few people think it's cool or might make more people like them. He also accused alicexbt of spamming and making noise about CTV, citing examples of emails and social media posts. Alicexbt defended their position by saying that the developers who participated in the discussion are competent enough to understand code and soft forks, and funding is a real issue for bitcoin developers that won't just benefit them but everyone. Alicexbt also addressed the issue of whether covenants are contentious, stating that there are no technical NACKs for CTV. They proposed improving the review process for soft fork BIPs and sharing honest opinions on technical merits. Alicexbt prefers BIP 8 or an improved version of it for soft fork, but is open to other proposals if they improve Bitcoin. Despite John Carvalho's objections, alicexbt believes that implementing covenants before the next cycle would provide an opportunity for developers to build interesting things during the bear market.
