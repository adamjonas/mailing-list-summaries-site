    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Antoine Riard and Peter Todd, the two discuss a recent experiment involving fee-bumping transactions without the opt-in RBF flag set. Todd changed one of his OTS calendars to issue these transactions and made sure they would propagate to Riard's node. As of now, there have been 32 replacements (once per block) without any of them being mined. This suggests that there is not much full-RBF hash power at the moment. However, Riard points out that it could also be a lack of full-RBF propagation path towards such potential hash power. The day they see an opt-out replacement transaction mined, it would constitute a good hint of full-RBF hash power. Todd suggests reaching out to a few mining node operators to advocate for the new policy setting when the "fullrbf" patch lands in Bitcoin Core. Riard suggests doing so immediately as it improves the politics of getting the patch merged. Miners tend to run customized bitcoind's anyway.</p>
