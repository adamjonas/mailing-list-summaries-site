    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin's security is a critical issue that depends on its continued growth and user adoption. As a proof of work system, Bitcoin is only secure at scale, meaning that both factors are essential for its success. Although demand for block space is currently not necessary to pay for security due to the block rewards, demand for BTC itself is required for those rewards to have any value. The question then becomes: who believes that Bitcoin is inevitable, and who thinks that it can be damaged or destroyed?</p>
