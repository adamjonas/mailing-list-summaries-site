    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user expressed interest in implementing more RBF (Replace-By-Fee) policy options in Bitcoin Core. However, Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, disagreed with the idea, stating that RBF policies aren't very useful in isolation and that there's no reason to accommodate multiple policies. He argued that unless you're getting your transactions to other nodes/miners via special peering efforts, running an uncommon RBF policy is unnecessary. Todd added that he could understand a -fullrbf flag for enabling full-RBF all the time, but there's no need to go beyond that. He suggested that those interested in advancing the state of policy options in Bitcoin Core should refer to available resources and communities to contribute to the codebase.</p>
