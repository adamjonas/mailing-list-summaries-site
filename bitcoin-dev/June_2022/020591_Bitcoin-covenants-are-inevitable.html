    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 19, 2022, Manuel Costa via bitcoin-dev discussed the potential issue of block rewards being too low to maintain acceptable security. He suggested that multiple solutions would be implemented, including a hard fork to indefinitely maintain some degree of block subsidy. However, it was mentioned that before resorting to this option, increasing block demand with advanced transaction support should be attempted instead of throwing money and growth away to support one narrative. By implementing features like covenant support and mweb, higher fees could potentially be obtained. Additionally, on-chain mixing protocols, vaults, and higher utility could provide enough sustainability for bitcoin on fees alone forever.</p>
