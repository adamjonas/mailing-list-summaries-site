    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On May 10, 2022, Rusty Russell via bitcoin-dev shared some ideas regarding the OPTX_SEPARATELY and OPTX_UNHASHED fields. These fields can be treated separately instead of concatenating and pushed on the stack without hashing, respectively. The discussion was related to a case where one wants to update the CTV hash by committing to specific outputs. However, both approaches seem less efficient than using a merkle path. It is also difficult to prove that the output is being taken in its entirety.This concern seems to be more related to upgradability, which is relevant if additional features like CAT or TLUV are added. Both OP_TX and CTV are trying to take upgradability into account in advance. Overall, these concepts could potentially improve the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network.</p>
