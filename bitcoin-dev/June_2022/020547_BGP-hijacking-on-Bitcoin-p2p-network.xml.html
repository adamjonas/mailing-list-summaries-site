    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin nodes are vulnerable to BGP hijacking, according to a 2014 answer on Stack Exchange. This vulnerability was demonstrated in March 2022 when the Twitter prefix was hijacked. Details of the incident were shared in two blog posts: one from ISC Sans and another from MANRS. The Tor network is also vulnerable to BGP hijacking, as detailed in an article by 'nusenu'. To mitigate these attacks, RPKI ROA and BGP prefix length can be used. However, a check of the first 10 IP addresses returned in `getnodeaddresses` in bitcoin core showed that they had vulnerable results. The author is seeking technical feedback and links to existing solutions or discussions. If none exist, they plan to write a research article or blog post in the coming weeks.</p>
