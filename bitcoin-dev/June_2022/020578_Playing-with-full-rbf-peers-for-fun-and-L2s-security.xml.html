    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of LN and other related systems is dependent on the transaction being mined within a certain number of blocks. However, it is not possible to guarantee this regardless of fees paid, making it vulnerable if a project's security relies on it. Full-RBF has been proposed as a simple and incentive-compatible step towards more robust layer two systems. While some disagree with the rationale and lack of basic options in Bitcoin Core to employ/disable different RBF policies, others suggest using alternative implementations like Bitcoin Knots that have these options. Additionally, there are concerns about the impact of full-rbf on vulnerable projects and the lack of consensus among nodes and miners in adopting it. Despite this, proponents argue that it is necessary to address the low-fruit, naive DoS vector playable against the funding flow of multi-party funded transactions. The issue can be fixed one layer above by introducing fidelity bonds or a reliable centralized coordinator, though at the price of an overhead per-participant resources cost and loss in system openness.</p>
