        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Several discussions have taken place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the limitations and security of the OpenTimestamps (OTS) system used for timestamping documents. While OTS can prove the duration of a document, it cannot prove its shortness or that an earlier version was not already published. Additionally, there are concerns over the requirement to publicize .ots files for timestamping using the OTS system, which could lead to fourth parties replacing the timestamp with their own, changing the earliness of the data.Peter Todd, creator of OTS, addressed these concerns, explaining that without cryptographic pinning, a fourth party could replace the .ots file with their own, rendering it impossible to prove anything about it. In addition, the victim of abuse expressed concern over the system's inability to prove uniqueness or validity of content. There were also discussions on the importance of real timestamping and how Bitcoin has been used for this purpose since the start of cryptocurrency.The author of the context emphasizes the significance of pinning a public hash to the bitcoin blockchain to protect the accuracy of history when it is not safe. They suggest that Bitcoin should have had a simplistically designed and well-backed decentralized propagation and storage of data, but political issues prevented this from happening. The author notes that other chains have made strides in this aspect, and believes that Satoshi was not familiar with how people behave when they have a lot of money.The discussion also touched upon the issue of replacing an earlier timestamp with a later one, but it was clarified that one cannot replace a timestamp in the OTS system; they can only make a new timestamp. Jeremy Rubin proposed a model for timestamping services, which he claims is necessary for any correct timestamping service to follow, while also highlighting the limitations of timestamp proofs.There were concerns raised about the security of .ots files when shared with other parties, with some users suggesting uploading .ots files to chains with cheap storage such as arweave or bitcoin sv to prove which one was first when there is more than one. Another user recommended including more cryptographic information in the original OP_RETURN to obviate the need for publicizing .ots files. However, Peter Todd responded by stating that client-side validated .ots files are necessary for scalability.Overall, while OTS provides a useful time-stamping system, it has limitations and other semantics need to be built into systems that rely on timestamps. It is suggested that for higher precision absolute time, there are many trusted alternatives like the NIST random beacon, Roughtime, etc. Bitcoin block hashes make for a perfectly good random beacon for use-cases with day to hour level precision.</p>
