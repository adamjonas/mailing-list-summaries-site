    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer acknowledges Jorge's request for detailed specifics as reasonable, and agrees that the level of discussion can be raised. They suggest that every claim made should have technical merit, and any comments on prior claims should be backed up with citations and explanations of why they do not advance technical consensus. The writer also highlights the presence of mean comments and suggests that a "Truth and Reconciliation" effort will be necessary in order to address them. They speculate that this effort may require a significant amount of work, potentially even resulting in another history book.</p>
