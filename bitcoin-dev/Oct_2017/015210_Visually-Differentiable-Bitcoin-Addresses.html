    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>When copying and pasting a bitcoin address, it is common practice to double check the first few bytes to ensure that the correct address has been copied. This is done to prevent rogue software from changing the address or the user from pasting an incorrect address. However, with Bech32 addresses, it seems that this method of verification has become more difficult. Unlike traditional addresses where the first few bytes can be compared, Bech32 only displays "bc1." which makes visual comparison difficult. Most users will only compare the first few bytes of the address since full addresses are long and may not fit in a mobile text box. As a result, the writer is wondering if there is any way to make the Bech32 address format more visually distinct, particularly the first few bytes. It is important to note that a solution would need to be user-friendly and accessible to all.</p>
