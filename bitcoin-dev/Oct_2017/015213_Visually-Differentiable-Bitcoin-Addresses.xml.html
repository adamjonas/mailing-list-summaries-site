    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin address formats, a user expressed concern over the length of the Bech32 address format, which can be up to 62 bytes. The user noted that this could cause usability problems in block explorers, mobile devices, and payment terminals. They suggested that users would prefer a 20 byte address with a checksum over an address that wraps several lines. However, another user commented that checking only the first few bytes of a Bitcoin address is not sufficient for ensuring its correctness. This led to a discussion about the visual distinctiveness of the Bech32 format, with the original user suggesting that at least the first few bytes should be visually distinguishable. The purpose of inventing a Bitcoin address format was for usability and ease of identification, but the length of the Bech32 format may present challenges in certain contexts.</p>
