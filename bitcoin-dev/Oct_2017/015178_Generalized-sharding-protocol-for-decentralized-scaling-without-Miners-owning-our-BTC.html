    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a generic sharding protocol for all blockchains, including Bitcoin, has been put forward as an alternative to Drivechain. The idea would allow users to say "My coins on Chain A are going to be sent to Chain B", and then burn the coins on Chain A before creating a minting transaction on Chain B. Thin clients, nodes, and miners could verify that this had taken place, and users' client software would know where to look for the other coins. The proposal is fully decentralised, requires no modification to the Bitcoin protocol, and does not require ownership of coins to be given to miners in order to achieve scalability. Sharding is compared favourably with Drivechain, which is argued to offer objectively worse security, forcing users to give up their coins to a single group for whatever sidechains they interact with.</p>
