    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A solution to the Block Withholding Attack, based on an idea from Aviv Zohar, has been proposed to work for Bitcoin. The solution involves changing the difficulty algorithm, using a new_diff equation that divides DIFF_1 by the absolute value of the target minus an offset value. This offset is similar to a uint256 in Bitcoin and must be between network_hash_begin/end or miner_hash_begin/end. The offset_hash value is put as a tx hash at the beginning of the array of hashes making up the merkle root hash. When mining pools send a job to miners, they include the PoW hash range for miners to submit valid shares. The network_diff is much higher than the miner's diff, so it's impossible for cheat miners to find out which share could make a valid block. Two problems with this solution are that it requires a hard fork and would render existing ASIC DSHA256 chips useless, but new ASIC chips could be created based on the existing technology.</p>
