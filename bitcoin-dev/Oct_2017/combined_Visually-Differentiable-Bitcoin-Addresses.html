        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list recently discussed the usability and verification of bitcoin addresses. One suggestion was to map a 25-byte address to 16 words from a 6000-word list for easier human verification. It was emphasized that any small change in the input should produce a significantly different output to ensure security. The idea of displaying the 16 words in a 4 x 4 grid with no visual distractions was recommended. Additionally, grinding an address with enough zeros at the beginning to be expressed by fewer words was proposed for higher security keys.The use of images to verify addresses was also explored, but it was noted that our visual processing system may unconsciously "correct" visual input, making it unreliable. Generating an image based on the bytes of an address was suggested, but it was acknowledged that even small changes to the text input would result in significantly different images, which may not be practical for verification purposes.One specific concern raised was the lack of visual distinction in the Bech32 address format. With traditional addresses, users could visually compare the first few bytes, such as "1Ko" or "1L3." However, with Bech32 addresses, only the "bc1." prefix is visible, making it difficult to differentiate between addresses visually. This can lead to errors when copying addresses and detecting rogue software that alters the address.On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Shiva Sitamraju highlighted the usability problems caused by long addresses in block explorers, mobiles, and payment terminals. Ben Thompson added that checking only the first few bytes of a bitcoin address is insufficient to ensure its correctness, as vanity addresses matching the initial characters can be generated quickly. Moral Agent suggested mapping 25-byte addresses to a 16-word list for easier verification, while Danny proposed generating images based on the address bytes using identicon.The discussion focused on improving the visual distinctiveness of bitcoin addresses to facilitate easier verification and use. It was noted that the length of some addresses, particularly Bech32 addresses, can create usability challenges. Users expressed the need for visually distinct first few bytes in order to verify addresses accurately. However, no specific solutions were proposed during the discussion. The importance of address verification in ensuring secure and accurate bitcoin transactions was emphasized throughout the conversation.</p>
