    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin address format has been invented for usability and ease of identification. However, the length of some addresses creates usability problems for blockexplorers, mobiles, and payment terminals. To solve this problem, there is a suggestion to map the address to words, such as a 25-byte address being mapped to 16 words from a 6000-word list. This method is faster to verify than simply checking the long string of characters in an address.There is an issue with Bech32 addresses as well, as it is difficult to visually compare the first few bytes of the address. With traditional addresses, users could compare the first few bytes like "1Ko" or "1L3", but with Bech32 addresses, only "bc1." can be seen and compared which is likely to be the same anyway. This makes it difficult for users to ensure they have copied the correct address and to detect any rogue software that may alter the address.</p>
