        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin difficulty algorithm is facing criticism due to its imperfections, and there are concerns that a fork may occur if miners prioritize profit over security. This could lead to a situation where if 90% of hashrate goes toward using SegWit2x, BTC would face 10x delays in confirmations, which would negatively affect its price relative to BTC1. Such a situation could potentially cause an oscillation between the two coins worse than what BCH is experiencing and also lead to miner abandonment.To tackle this issue, a solution proposed is to implement a new difficulty algorithm through a hard fork. The recommended difficulty algorithm for Bitcoin is Zawy v6, which uses a simple rolling average with a smaller window. Additionally, the reward should be adjusted based on recent solvetimes to keep the coin issuance rate on schedule.The constants until the next hard fork are set as T=600 and N=30 for the averaging window, X=5 for the size of sudden hashrate changes expected as multiple of base hashrate, limit = X^(2/N) to limit rise and fall to protect against timestamp errors and manipulation, and adjust = 1/(1+0.67/N) to keep avg solvetime on track for small N. The difficulty algorithm begins with avg_ST=0 and avg_D=0 and goes through the N most recent blocks to calculate the average SolveTime and Difficulty. If avg_ST exceeds T*limit or is less than T/limit, it is adjusted accordingly. Overall, the proposed solution aims to create a more efficient and secure system for Bitcoin. By implementing a new difficulty algorithm, it will ensure that miners do not prioritize profit over security, and prevent potential issues such as miner abandonment and an oscillation between coins.</p>
