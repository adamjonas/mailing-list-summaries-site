    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin difficulty algorithm has a problem that can lead to the "better" coin being the minority chain. Hard forks should not be rushed and receive more than the usual level of expert and community review. The hardfork research group is suggested as a more accommodating venue for discussion on the topic. A new difficulty algorithm is being proposed to solve this problem. The proposed algorithm uses a simple rolling average with a much smaller window. Many small coins have already implemented this to stop big miners from leaving suddenly, leaving constant miners stuck with high difficulty for the rest of a long averaging window. The proposed algorithm is recommended for Bitcoin as it is fast, simple and better than any other difficulty algorithm known.</p>
