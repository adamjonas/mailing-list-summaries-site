    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Shiva Sitamraju raised concerns about the length of Bech32 addresses. They cited an example of a 62-byte address and claimed that users would prefer a 20-byte address with a checksum over one that wraps several lines. However, Pieter Wuille, one of the developers of SegWit and Bech32, pointed out that the provided address was a P2WSH address containing a 256-bit hash. In contrast, a P2WPKH address in Bech32 only contains a 160-bit hash and is only 42 characters long. While Shiva's concerns are understandable, Pieter's clarification highlights that the actual length of Bech32 addresses may not be as problematic as they initially appear.</p>
