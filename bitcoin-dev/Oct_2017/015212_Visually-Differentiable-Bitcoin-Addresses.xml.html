    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user expressed concern with the difficulty of double checking Bech32 addresses. They stated that they typically double check the first few bytes of a traditional address when copying and pasting to ensure it hasn't been tampered with or copied incorrectly. However, with Bech32 addresses, they can only compare the beginning "bc1." which may not be distinct enough. They asked if there was a way to make the format more visually distinct, at least in the first few bytes. The user suggested that since most users only compare the first few bytes, the lack of visual distinction could be problematic.</p>
