    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer acknowledges that a new difficulty algorithm starting from zero is rushed, but given the current situation, it is inconceivable to not have one ready in two months. They express a desire to discuss this algorithm and its goals before creating a draft BIP at the HF page. The writer mentions the possibility of Karbowanek coin being interested in putting the algorithm into live action and soliciting hash attacks. This coin has been using a simpler N=17 algorithm since last November and has tested all attempted improvements.The writer notes that this particular coin split is different and assumes users currently prefer SW. However, miner support could convince enough users that SegWit2x is a worthy alternative, resulting in both coins oscillating with long delays as long as the price is similar. If the price is not similar, the loser may be pushed to the margin like previous coins. The writer sees this as a potential bitcoin feature but believes the 2016 window is too brutal and may result in an accidental winner before the better coin can be determined by more rational means.</p>
