    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer explains that there is a practical limit to the number of blocks that can be orphaned even under a 51% attack. The value of tokens solely on the 2X chain will not be as high as those on the Core chain, which would incentivize miners to gain tokens on the Core chain. Hodlers have greater power in hardfork situations than miners due to economic disincentives for mining on the 2X chain. Miners switching to BCH is not an attractive option as its value is less than BT2 tokens. Changing difficulty algorithms can have negative effects on the security of the chain. It is better to let the market decide on the fate of 2X, and not hardfork in response to a contentious situation. Changes like difficulty adjustment, PoW change, or block size cannot be safely done in response to a contentious hardfork. If the Core chain fails, then Bitcoin has failed and hodlers should sell their holdings and find other means to amuse themselves.</p>
