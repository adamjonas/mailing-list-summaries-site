    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between developers, the idea of allowing 0 value outputs was brought up again. Jeremy proposed a carve out that would allow 0 value outputs as long as they were used as Intermediate Outputs and the parent had a higher feerate after CPFP'ing than the parent alone. This would prevent 0 value utxos from proliferating long and still allow them to be spent by the fee paying transaction later. The proposal presupposes a fully working package relay system and may be helpful for CTV based contracts and spacechains. However, it was noted that introducing this rule would complicate mempool. Ruben brought up a scenario in which the 0 sat output could still enter the UTXO set under certain rules. To prevent this from happening, the 0 sat output needs to be the only spendable output and a relative timelock on other outputs would do the trick. It's worth noting that a policy rule cannot be made to prevent the 0 sat output from being left unspent, as miners would get more fees if they evicted child C1. Finally, a diagram was provided to show where 0 sat outputs would be helpful for spacechains.</p>
