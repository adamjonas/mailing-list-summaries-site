        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses the use of Bitcoin transactions for playing chess and its potential impact on increasing demand for block space. The original sender is seeking approval or permission for certain types of Bitcoin transactions, such as opening and closing Lightning Network channels or using OP_RETURN. The response states that as long as a transaction is valid, standard, and pays fees, there should be no issues with the desired transaction. However, it is noted that frivolous use of block space is not encouraged.The sender shares a link to a GitHub page outlining their project to play chess on the Lightning Network. They mention two related projects, Koala Studio and Etleneum, which have previously attempted chess on LN but have either shut down or work differently. As a result, the current project may have to explore other two-player games that can be played over several hours or days and are compatible with the setup. The primary goal of the project remains testing Bitcoin transactions while having fun and contributing to increasing demand for block space.It is clarified that zero fee transactions no longer work, and all transactions will need to pay the required fees in the long term. The email also mentions the use of OP_RETURN by many projects, which is excluded from the UTXO set. The email is signed by Lord His Excellency James HRMH (& HMRH) of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire and Mr. Damian A. James Williamson from Willtech, go-overt.com, duigco.org DUIGCO API, and other projects. Contact information for Willtech, including a phone number and fax number, is provided. The email notes that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered. In conclusion, Prayank23, the sender of the email, clarifies that they will not be actively working on this project as they are currently occupied with another project and have recently started contributing to Wasabi.</p>
