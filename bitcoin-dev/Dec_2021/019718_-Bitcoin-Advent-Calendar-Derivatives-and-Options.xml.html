    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin dev mailing list, a user named Yancy mentioned that the p2pderivatives DLC application is still under active development and provided a GitHub link to the project. Another user named Prayank added that a similar approach is used in discreet log contracts for multi oracles and linked the p2pderivatives-client, p2pderivatives-server, and p2pderivatives-oracle GitHub repositories. They also questioned whether CTV was necessary for this project and discussed the potential benefits of unilateral derivatives. Thibaut, another user, chimed in to mention that rust-dlc is also under active development and supports multi oracle contracts and other features found in the DLC specs. They invited Jeremy to attend their monthly DLC spec meeting to discuss how CTV could improve the Bitcoin derivatives ecosystem and what could be reused from DLCs. The discussion highlights the continued development and exploration of derivatives in the Bitcoin community.</p>
