    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev post, Aymeric Vitte expressed concerns over using the Tor network to bypass censorship for Bitcoin. He stated that while it could work, it is not an ideal solution due to the Tor network's centralization, small size, and susceptibility to being watched and controlled. Pieter, another user, added that creating a hidden service has zero cost, making it easy for anyone to spin up multiple Bitcoin hidden services. This can make a node that only connects to hidden services easily eclipsable. While Pieter did not recommend against using Tor for Bitcoin traffic altogether, he emphasized that there are trade-offs and aspects of privacy that Tor does not address. Therefore, one should not assume that all problems are solved simply by using Tor.</p>
