    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin mining pools are not a new concept, as pooling has been used in resource management for some time. These pools can hedge against fee rates and increases in hashrate, and reward functions can be defined in various ways to contribute to the smoothing functionality. The article discusses sub-block pooling, which helps micro-pools split resources non-custodially as part of the higher order DCFMP. This decreases the minimum viable pool size and could include an uncle block type mechanism for opt-in participation in the pool. The author questions the critique of payment pool mechanisms to cut-through chain space and whether it holds for all payment pools or just in the context of mining. They ask if it is preferable for miners to use custodial services for pooling over bearing the cost of extra potential chainload. The proposal may seem complex, but it is simple when taken in a broader context, as non-interactive channels and payment pools are already useful by themselves, and most of the complexity relies on tools that will likely be used in everyday situations.</p>
