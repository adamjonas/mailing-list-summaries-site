    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange with Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev mailing list, the author discusses privacy concerns in rebroadcasting transactions and differentiating between the privacy of the connection of a node, the identification of the public IP of the node, and the suspected original of a transaction. The author suggests that pseudo-random and lengthening per attempt length of time between receiving gossip about a transaction and rebroadcasting attempts could help address some of these privacy concerns. While rebroadcasting is currently done by wallets and reveals a node-transaction relation to peers, moving to a model where mempools/nodes themselves are responsible for rebroadcasting could help fix this specific leak in privacy. The author also notes that using privacy-enhancing network communications, such as TOR, can help hide IP-transaction relations but has its own downsides like susceptibility to partition/Eclipse/DoS attacks.</p>
