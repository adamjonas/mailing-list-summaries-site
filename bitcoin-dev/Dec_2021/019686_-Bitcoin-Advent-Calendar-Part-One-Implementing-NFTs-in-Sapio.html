    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a blog post on rubin.io, Jeremy Rubin shares his thoughts on NFTs and their potential for advancing the state of the art for various purposes. While acknowledging that NFTs are controversial, Rubin argues that the techniques used in their creation can be applied to many other types of things beyond just "stupid JPGs." For example, he suggests that Lightning Channels and DLCs could be considered NFTs because they require knowledge about counterparties and oracles, respectively. Additionally, Rubin notes that while Colored Coins/Tokens are not NFTs by definition, fractional shares of an NFT could be considered Colored Coins. By advancing the state of the art for NFTs, Rubin believes that we can also advance the state of the art for other purposes while still having fun. Those interested in reading more about why NFTs are cool even if JPGs are lame can refer to some of Rubin's previous blog posts on the subject.</p>
