        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jeremy Rubin, in his blog post on rubin.io, discusses the potential of NFTs in advancing the state of the art for various purposes. Though NFTs have been a controversial topic, Rubin argues that the techniques used in their creation can be applied beyond just "stupid JPGs". He suggests that Lightning Channels and DLCs could be considered NFTs because they require knowledge about counterparties and oracles, respectively. Additionally, he notes that while Colored Coins/Tokens are not NFTs by definition, fractional shares of an NFT could be considered Colored Coins. Rubin believes that by advancing the state of the art for NFTs, we can also advance the state of the art for other purposes while still having fun. Those interested in reading more about why NFTs are cool can refer to some of Rubin's previous blog posts on the subject. Overall, the potential for NFTs extends beyond just digital art and has the capability to revolutionize how we approach other areas of technology as well.</p>
