    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In his latest post, Jeremy Rubin explains how Sapio modules can be used composably. He invites feedback on this active area of research for the Sapio platform. However, he also expresses dissatisfaction with the "JSONSchema Type System" despite its remarkable flexibility. A better type system could enforce guarantees more strongly and introduce formal correctness. Comparing it to things like ERC-20, Eth interfaces aren't particularly binding as functions could do anything. Jeremy welcomes any thoughts or ideas on better ways to accomplish this.Jeremy also encourages general feedback on the series outside of the band. There are upcoming posts in the pipeline that are less development-focused than earlier posts he excluded. He is willing to filter them if people feel overwhelmed, but he would lean towards posting the remaining pieces for continuity. If anyone feels strongly about a couple of posts that might be a topical reach for this list, they should let him know.</p>
