    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses a proposal for non-custodial mining pools that addresses the issue of central custody in point 1 of the goals list. The proposal uses multisig and leaf nodes to enable smaller miners to participate without central custody, but the issue of data availability remains. The benefits of the proposal include increased payout regularity, no KYC/AML, no extra network software required, lower blockchain bloat, no extra infrastructure needed, and a smaller viable pool size. The idea of using weak blocks off-chain for solo mining is also discussed, but the extra software component and data availability are noted as issues. Finally, the safety of throwing block rewards into a channel and being able to spend them immediately is questioned, but it is noted that miners already take this risk with multisig and lightning channels.</p>
