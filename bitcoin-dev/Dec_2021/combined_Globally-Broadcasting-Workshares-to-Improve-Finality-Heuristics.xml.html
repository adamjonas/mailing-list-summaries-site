        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a conversation with Nic Carter, Jeremy Rubin proposed a concept related to Bitcoin Core that could provide more accurate finality estimates and warnings if hashrate abandons the chain tip. By setting up Bitcoin Core to gossip headers for work shares, the system would be able to notice missing work, which is observable regardless of whether dishonest miners choose to publish their work on non-tip shares. The GUI could then provide users with additional warning if they accept payment during a sudden hashrate decrease, advising them to wait longer before accepting the payment. This idea is similar to Bobtail, which was presented at Scaling Bitcoin a few years ago in the paper linked above.Rune referenced a concept that he believes may be related to what Jeremy is discussing. The reference link leads to a post on the BitcoinTalk forum, which presumably provides more information on the concept in question. However, without further context it is difficult to determine exactly what the concept is or how it relates to Jeremy's discussion. It is not clear whether this concept has been discussed before or on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
