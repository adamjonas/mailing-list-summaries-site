    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been discussed that it is not possible to use Lightning network for NFTs on Bitcoin because lightning relies on liquidity to work, which NFTs are not. A solution suggested is using Ruben Somsens state chain protocol, which allows swapping utxos off-chain and could harbor an op return/nft. The discussion also mentioned the possibility of defining a protocol that associates an OP_RETURN with ownership, which could then be transferred via lightning by sending associated currency via lightning. It was also suggested that technically, OP_RETURN could be divisible with a protocol layer parallel to Bitcoin/Lightning that stores and reads all Bitcoin transactions and the ones which involve the node's channels as well as the ones with the OP_RETURN, similar to how CounterParty does right now with the primary ledger.</p>
