    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new mining pool coordination system called Braidpool has been developed, which aims to increase payout regularity and lower the viable size of mining pools. This mechanism would allow smaller mining pools to have a higher variance, and the on-chain footprint would actually be higher due to the increased payout regularity. The goal of this design is to reduce variance reduction and hedge against increases in hashrate. The existing discussion for Braidpool has been happening privately, but there are a discussion forum and mailing list available for people to join. The creators of Braidpool are actively working on the project, and additional contributors are welcome. There is also a proposal to use CTV for some of the things in Braidpool, such as payment pools and unilateral channel openings. However, some people have expressed concerns about the design. One person mentioned that the half-baked design posted is less than useless and does not do anything that anyone wants. They suggest that the creators pick one problem for which CTV is demonstrably the right and best solution instead of trying to make it all things to all people. Another person suggests using a separate ephemeral blockchain to keep track of which weak blocks have been submitted to determine what blocks should definitely be part of a particular block's pay out. One concern raised was the safety of throwing block rewards into a channel and being able to spend them immediately, and instead suggested reducing the on-chain wait time for spending block rewards. Finally, Bob McElrath made a quote about every complex problem having a simple, neat, and wrong solution.</p>
