    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the conversation is about using Tor protocol independently of the Tor network, and from the browsers also acting as nodes. The proposer has been suggesting this for years to Bitcoin. The recipient understands the concept and likes it, but had some issues with the use of JavaScript and WebRTC, which were partially answered in a link provided. The recipient appreciates the proposer's passion for privacy, nodes, and contributing to Bitcoin. They suggest presenting the idea with a demo and talking to other developers in the community in real life. They recommend applying for the open-source stage of a conference and offer sponsorship for flight tickets if needed.</p>
