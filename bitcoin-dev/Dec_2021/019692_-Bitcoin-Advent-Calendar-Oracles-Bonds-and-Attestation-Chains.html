    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the issue of punishing stakeholders for signing the wrong thing and making changes to answers without risking funds. The author notes that a single equivocation can lead to unbounded equivocation by third parties, allowing for the complete rewriting of the signature chain. Additionally, if a musig key is used for staking and an individual equivocates three times, they are out. The author is uncertain about the practical application of this. While lying cannot be punished, stakers who sign with the majority receive allocated reward tokens for that slot; however, if an individual equivocates to switch and get tokens, they will burn their collateral. This creates an incentive for stakers to try to sign the correct statement in line with peers.</p>
