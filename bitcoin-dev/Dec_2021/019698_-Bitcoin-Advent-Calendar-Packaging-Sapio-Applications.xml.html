    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post on Rubin.io, Jeremy Rubin discusses the importance of packaging Sapio applications. He mentions that while it may be a bit more annoying than usual, it is crucial. Rubin also expresses his admiration for WebAssembly (WASM), noting that it has been very helpful for Sapio. He envisions software like Bitcoin Core being able to run Sapio modules natively, offering users extended functionality based on that. Although he is currently building out the wallet as Sapio Studio, Rubin dreams of using WASM for consensus upgrades. Rubin suggests that implementing the semantics of pieces of bitcoin code as WASM modules would help guarantee that those pieces of the code are entirely deterministic. He thinks this could be something for Simplicity to consider, with WASM being the host language for JET extensions. Overall, Rubin's post highlights the potential benefits of packaging Sapio applications and utilizing WASM for bitcoin code.</p>
