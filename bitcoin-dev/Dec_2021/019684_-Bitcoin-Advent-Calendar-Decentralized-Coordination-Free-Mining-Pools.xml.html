    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email being discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is centered around the concept of pooling resources in Bitcoin mining. The proposal suggests decreasing the size of the minimum viable pool through sub-block pooling, with a focus on increasing payout regularity and lowering on-chain footprint. However, concerns have been raised about whether this design can enable solo mining or not.There is also a debate on the viability of payment pools to cut-through chain space and whether strongly online counterparties would be able to coordinate more efficiently or not. Some suggest that the proposal needs to focus on one problem for which it is demonstrably the right and best solution. Additionally, the issue of throwing block rewards into a channel and being able to spend them immediately has been discussed, and the fact that all coinbase rewards are unspendable for 100 blocks has been emphasized.The proposal itself is described as simple when viewed in a broader context. Non-interactive channels and payment pools, along with operations to merge them and swap balance across them, are useful on their own and will likely be in everyday use regardless of whether or not this proposal is implemented. Therefore, most of the complexity in the proposal relies on tools that are expected to be commonly used.Finally, the email proposes creating a separate ephemeral blockchain to keep track of weak blocks and determine what blocks should be part of a particular block's pay out. The discussion highlights the importance of considering all aspects of the proposal and avoiding oversimplification.</p>
