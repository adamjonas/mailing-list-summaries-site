        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The blog post by Jeremy Rubin explores various high-level smart contract concepts related to different opcodes or proposals. The author begins by discussing the concept of recursion in programming, also known as "Turing Complete". To help remember this concept, the author references an Indian movie titled 'Karthik calling Karthik'. Moving on, the limitations of unrolling loops are addressed, particularly when choices are introduced, leading to exponential blowup. However, the author notes that clever and careful programmers can mitigate this complexity through memoization. The author agrees with these limitations and acknowledges the possibility of optimization.The conversation then delves into the distinction between fully enumerated and open-ended contract cases. In the latter, dynamic specification of bits and pieces is permitted. An intriguing example is provided where Alice is paid 1 BTC by December 25th, 2021 Midnight, and subsequently transfers 100 tokens to one of Bob's addresses at his discretion.Towards the end of the blog post, the author shares a newfound knowledge about signing the transaction fee rate as a function of locktime. This adds another layer of understanding to the subject matter.Overall, the blog post by Jeremy Rubin covers a range of smart contract concepts, discussing recursion, limitations of unrolling loops, open-ended contract cases, and transaction fee rate signing. The author encourages readers to share their thoughts on other relevant properties. The post was published on December 4, 2021, and is accessible on rubin.io.</p>
