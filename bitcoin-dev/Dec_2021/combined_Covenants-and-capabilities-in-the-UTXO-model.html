        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Bram Cohen has suggested the addition of programmatic capabilities to the language to enable full support for both capabilities and covenants in the UTXO model without changing it. Special-purpose opcodes would also be required to allow coherent statements about transactions, given their complexity and hard-to-parse format. The conversation emphasises the importance of ensuring that recipients of payments with covenants fully understand them, as retroactive veto or clawback actions would be unacceptable behaviour. The potential issue of implementing complex general-purpose functionality, which tends to become very expensive very fast, was also discussed, along with suggestions to compress or de-duplicate snippets of code to save bandwidth and help Bitcoin scale better. There are concerns about a proposal that could require nodes to keep around the whole blockchain, potentially causing scalability issues. Allowing references to old blocks could result in a situation similar to Monero's UTXO set being the whole blockchain, which would cause problems for pruned nodes.In a separate discussion, there is concern about transactions becoming invalid due to the limitation of only being able to point back so far, which could result in problems during reorgs. The conversation between Billy Tetrud and an unknown recipient discusses Bitcoin's lack of a strong single concept of a 'parent' and the idea of optimizing for adding as little to the UXTO model as possible. The recipient expresses concern about intentional DOS or spikes in transaction fees causing technical issues.In another discussion about Bitcoin covenants, Billy Tetrud and an anonymous party discuss the concept of having a UTXO that can only be spent if the resulting outputs of that transaction all share the same script. There are two concepts at play here: the lack of a strong single concept for a 'parent' in Bitcoin transactions, and the ability for a coin to check its own ID and verify the secure hash chain from its parent to itself.The conversation between Bram Cohen and Billy Tetrud discusses the implementation of covenants in Bitcoin, which allows for the specification of a UTXO's spending rules. Cohen suggests the ability to assert that a parent UTXO has a specific scriptpubkey, allowing for UTXOs with certain capabilities to only be absorbed by transactions involving other UTXOs with the same capability. The discussion also touches on the use of turing completeness in Bitcoin, with Tetrud suggesting that limiting the runtime of scripts could make it less risky. Additionally, they discuss the idea of using special purpose opcodes for making coherent statements about transactions and the potential for deduplication of common script snippets to save bandwidth. However, they also note that careful consideration is needed to ensure that recipients of payments are fully aware of the covenant attached to the payment, as any retroactive veto or clawback would be unacceptable. If the recipient cannot parse a UTXO, it should be assumed "bricked."

He pointed out that Monero's UTXO set is already the whole blockchain due to the difficulty in determining what has been spent and what hasn't been. Allowing references to old blocks could result in a similar situation for Bitcoin, which would cause problems for pruned nodes. The suggestion of only pointing back so far was also dismissed, as it would make transactions invalid and could lead to issues during reorgs. This highlights the importance of carefully considering proposals before implementing them to ensure they don't cause unintended consequences.</p>
