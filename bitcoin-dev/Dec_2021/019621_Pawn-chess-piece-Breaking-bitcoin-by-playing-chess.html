    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the use of Bitcoin transactions for playing chess and how it can contribute to increasing demand for block space. The original sender asks for an email address to get approval or permission for certain types of Bitcoin transactions such as opening and closing Lightning Network channels or using OP_RETURN. The response states that as long as a transaction is valid, standard, and pays fees, there should be no issues with what is being achieved with the transaction. The email also mentions that frivolous use of block space is not encouraged. The sender shares a link to a GitHub page outlining their project to play chess on the Lightning Network. They mention two related projects and suggest that the primary goal of their project is to test Bitcoin transactions while having fun and contributing to increasing demand for block space. They clarify that zero fee transactions do not work anymore and all transactions will pay fees required long term. Lastly, they mention that they won't be working on this project as they are busy with another project and recently started contributing to Wasabi.</p>
