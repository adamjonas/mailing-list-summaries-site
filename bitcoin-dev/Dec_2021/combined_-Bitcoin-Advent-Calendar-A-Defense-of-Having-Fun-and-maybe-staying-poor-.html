        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer named Eugene has decided to abandon his project of implementing a human versus chess engine in Solidity. The project involved creating interactive NFTs that represent the contract's internal states, although it is unclear why NFTs were incorporated into the project. Some suggestions were made to try implementing the project on Lightning as well. When asked about working on Bitcoin instead, Eugene stated that while Bitcoin development can be fun, it is often not enjoyable. This sentiment has caused multiple contributors to step down from their involvement recently, as even small features require significant effort to ship. It is difficult to convince newcomers to work on Bitcoin full-time due to these challenges. The issue of funding in open-source projects extends beyond Bitcoin and is being addressed by various individuals and organizations.Despite the difficulties, Eugene believes that any issues with Bitcoin development can be resolved. He argues that NFTs are a phenomenon that people should care about, citing examples such as the development of Zero Knowledge Roll-Ups to address scaling challenges in Ethereum, as well as privacy solutions like Tornado Cash. However, Prayank disagrees and claims that the trend towards NFTs is primarily driven by the desire for financial gain and lacks true innovation.In a recent post by Jeremy Rubin, he takes a less technical and more philosophical approach. The post has received positive feedback from readers and focuses on the importance of having fun as a treat. Rubin mentions that he will continue to share posts based on private feedback he has received from multiple individuals. Those interested in reading the post can find the link provided. Overall, the post delivers a lighthearted message encouraging readers to find enjoyment in the midst of their work and responsibilities.</p>
