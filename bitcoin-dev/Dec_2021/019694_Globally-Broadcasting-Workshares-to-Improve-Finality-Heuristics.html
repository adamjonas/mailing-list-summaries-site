    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a conversation with Nic Carter, Jeremy proposed an interesting concept related to Bitcoin Core. If the platform is set up to gossip headers for work shares, it would be possible to have more accurate finality estimates and warnings if hashrate abandons the chain tip. By observing missing work, users could receive additional warnings if they accept payment during a sudden hashrate decrease. This idea is similar to Bobtail, which was presented at Scaling Bitcoin a few years ago in the paper linked above. There is no indication of whether this concept has been previously discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
