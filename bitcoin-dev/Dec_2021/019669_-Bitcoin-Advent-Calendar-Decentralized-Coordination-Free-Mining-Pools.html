    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion centers around the goals of a payout function for solo miners and those using mining pools. The primary goal is to mine blocks that meet network difficulty, with rewards adjusted based on the number of times easier blocks are mined in a pool. To simplify verification of coinbase rewards, each miner can validate transactions once and assign transaction fees to transaction IDs. Difficulty levels can be assigned to limit the amount of work produced by each share, which helps avoid spamming and makes it more profitable to create bigger shares. A longer window of a few difficulty periods can help hedge against hashrate changes and smooth out block revenues. However, the responder doesn't fully understand the proposed solution and asks for clarification regarding its meeting the goals of the payout function.</p>
