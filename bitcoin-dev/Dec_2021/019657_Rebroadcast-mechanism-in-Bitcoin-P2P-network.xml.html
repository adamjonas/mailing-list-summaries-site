    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the importance of privacy in transaction activities. The writer suggests that privacy-enhancing network communications such as TOR could be the solution to the privacy concerns. However, the current rebroadcasting approach on the network reveals information about nodes and transactions which could lead to privacy leaks. This node-transaction relation can be avoided by only connecting over Tor or other privacy networks but it is not sufficient. The writer believes that moving to a model where mempools/nodes are responsible for rebroadcasting could be a great solution to improving the specific problem of privacy leak. It will ensure that the original author doing the rebroadcasting does not stand out anymore.</p>
