    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy suggested an idea to ease into getting rid of full-rbf by keeping the flag working but enforcing non-replaceability n seconds after first seen. This would reduce the ability to partition mempools by broadcasting irreplaceable conflicts all at once and slowly ease clients off of relying on non-RBF. He suggested starting with 60 seconds and doubling every release until it reaches 600, at which point they disable it. Peter Todd, a cryptocurrency consultant, replied that making replacability turn on after an expiry time is reached had been suggested before. However, he believed that enabling full-rbf until a time is reached was clever and novel. He suggested doing both at once. Long-running transactions are useful, but if a transaction has not been mined in a few blocks, it cannot be relied on for zeroconf.</p>
