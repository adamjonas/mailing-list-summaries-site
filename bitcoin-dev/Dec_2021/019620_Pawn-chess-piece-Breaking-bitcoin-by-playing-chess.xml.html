    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the frivolous use of block space to increase demand, which is not encouraged. The email is signed by Lord His Excellency James HRMH (& HMRH) of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire and Mr. Damian A. James Williamson from Willtech, go-overt.com, duigco.org DUIGCO API, and other projects. The email contains contact information for Willtech, including a phone number and fax number. The email notes that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered. The email also includes a link to a GitHub page discussing a project involving using Bitcoin transactions to play chess. The project's primary goal is to test Bitcoin transactions, while its secondary goal is to have fun and contribute to increasing demand for block space. The email notes that zero-fee transactions no longer work and that all transactions will pay required fees in the long term. The email suggests that the project could be expanded to include other two-player games that work with the same setup and can be played over several hours or days. The email is signed by Prayank, whose PGP key is included.</p>
