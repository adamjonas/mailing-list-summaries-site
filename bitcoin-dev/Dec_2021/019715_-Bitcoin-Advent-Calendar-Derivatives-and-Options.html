    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message discusses the implementation of a threshold oracle in Bitcoin. The information for the oracle can be obtained from a third party or could be self-referential. The concept of a threshold oracle is used to ensure trustworthiness by relying on multiple oracles rather than one. This approach is also used in discreet log contracts for multi oracles. There is a project for P2P derivatives, but it has not been used for any real trades on mainnet or further developed. OP_CTV could make some aspects of this project nicer and open up new possibilities for opening these contracts unilaterally. Although CTV is not needed for this project, it can enhance certain aspects. The discussion ends with an interest in exploring derivatives as they are interesting and less explored or used in Bitcoin projects.</p>
