    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of Tor for Bitcoin traffic has its downsides, as it does not address all the privacy concerns of P2P protocols. For instance, using Tor for a bitcoin node exiting transactions can lead to the assumption that the transactions are related to the same node even if the IP is unknown. However, this does not mean that Tor should not be used at all for Bitcoin traffic, but rather that it should be used differently with node-Tor and hybrid nodes. One of the main differences in using Tor for Bitcoin nodes is how they behave, including the originating Bitcoin node, HS/RDV, number of hops, and hybrid nodes. Another drawback is that Bitcoin node operators have the freedom to manipulate torrc. Regarding js/webrtc, it is part of the project and already widely advertised in various areas like Bitcoin, IPFS, COVID apps, videoconf, etc. However, it is designed to be integrated by the projects and not the creator. The only thing missing is releasing phase4.</p>
