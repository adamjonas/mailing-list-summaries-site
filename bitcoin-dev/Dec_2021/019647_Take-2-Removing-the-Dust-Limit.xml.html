    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread begins with an individual named KING JAMES HRMH, writing from the Great British Empire, referring to avoiding a soft-fork as a political concession. Following this is a signature from The Australian, LORD HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES HRMH (& HMRH) of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire MR. Damian A. James Williamson Wills et al., and contact information for Willtech, including their website, LinkedIn page, and phone and fax numbers. The email then continues with a response to a message sent by Ruben Somsen via bitcoin-dev. Jeremy responds that a 0 value output entering the mempool is not a big problem, but rather if it is never spent. Even if C2/P1 goes in, C1 still can be spent, increasing its feerate. C2 must be expensive compared to C1 to be mined when C2 would not be. If the txn has two inputs and that input gets spent separately, it could break the solution. However, it should not be economically rational to create 0 value outputs instead of dust threshold value outputs. The email concludes with a suggestion for a utxo with drop semantics, in which if UTXO X with some flag on it is not spent in the block it is created, it expires and can never be spent. This covers OP_TRUE anchors efficiently and ones that require a signature as well. Two cases could be added: one bare segwit version and one equivalent to taproot. This is relatively similar to how Transaction Sponsors works but without full tx graph de-linkage.</p>
