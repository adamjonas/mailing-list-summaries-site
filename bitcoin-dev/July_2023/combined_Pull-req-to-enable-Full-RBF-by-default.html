        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the context has submitted a pull request to Bitcoin Core, proposing to enable full-replace-by-fee (full-rbf) by default. Currently, approximately 40% of total Bitcoin hash power is mining full-rbf replacements across eight different pools. Notably, block explorers like blockstream.info and mempool.space have already enabled full-rbf on all their nodes. Additionally, nodes installed via BTCPay Server and MyNode also have full-rbf enabled by default.Measurements indicate that a significant percentage of nodes have manually enabled full-rbf, and there is a well-connected set of nodes running the author's full-rbf peering patch. Successful full-rbf replacements are fairly common, as demonstrated on <a href="https://mempool.space/rbf">https://mempool.space/rbf</a>#fullrbf. However, the fact that only a minority of nodes relay full-rbf replacements poses a barrier to utilizing them in multi-party transactions.During previous discussions on full-rbf, the only opposition came from Bitrefill, who claimed to have an actual use for unconfirmed transactions. However, the author has found no evidence that Bitrefill still accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment, despite their payment page suggesting otherwise. All test transactions conducted by the author required confirmation.On-chain wallets have been moving towards removing the ability to set non-BIP125-rbf transactions. For instance, Electrum eliminated the option to turn off BIP125 last year. Similarly, wallets such as Phoenix, Green, Nunchuck, and Zeus do not provide a way to disable BIP125. These wallets consider "non-replaceable" transactions to be a support headache.The author argues that the concept of "on-chain coffee payments" is no longer viable and that maintaining the BIP125 distinction holds little value when a significant portion of hashing power disregards it. Therefore, the proposal suggests enabling full-rbf by default in Bitcoin Core's GitHub master, to be released in v26.0. Furthermore, the author proposes deprecating and eventually removing all BIP125 code and associated complexity in future releases.The context includes several references that support the points made. These references provide additional information on block explorers enabling full-rbf, nodes running full-rbf, multi-party transactions with full-rbf, opposition to full-rbf from Bitrefill, removal of non-BIP125-rbf transactions in on-chain wallets, and the value of enabling full-rbf by default.However, it is worth noting that Daniel Lipshitz from GAP600 raises concerns about the proposed change. He argues that enabling full-rbf by default would have a significantly negative impact on merchants and users who choose to accept 0-conf transactions while using mitigation tools like GAP600. According to GAP600 statistics, there has been a strong demand for their service, with around 350k unique transaction hashes per month. Lipshitz emphasizes that this use case is not insignificant and can be easily maintained without enabling full-rbf by default. He also questions the claimed 40% adoption rate of full-rbf by miners, as it contradicts their observation of double spend rates for their transactions. GAP600 aims to minimize double spends and reimburses clients if they get it wrong.</p>
