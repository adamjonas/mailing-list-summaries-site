    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The introduction of standardization rules in Bitcoin was to address certain issues, even though some argue that these rules are useless. Rules such as the opreturn limit, maxancestorcount, minrelayfee, and dust limit can be circumvented by miners, but instances of this happening are rare. Bitcoin defenders have an advantage in this cat and mouse game because it is easier to detect these transactions and establish them as standardization rules rather than creating new types of spam transactions.While the default policy may have its weaknesses, it can also be a strength. When a patch is integrated into Bitcoin Core and activated by default, its effectiveness increases as more nodes update. Using a pre-segwit node is not a viable solution because it cannot initiate new ones, which is a significant problem.Satoshi himself discussed spam in a forum post, emphasizing that not taking action against spam could be interpreted as tacit acceptance by spammers. Some people on the Bitcoin development mailing list do not consider ordinals as spam, which has led to debates about whether blocking ordinals is censorship. However, blocking ordinals alone may not solve the problem, as there are other ways for spammers to push data onto the blockchain. The larger issue lies in solving the initial blockchain download time and the growing UTXO set.The proposal to add a standardization option does not involve implementing a soft fork but allows the community to decide whether to activate it or not. However, simply adding settings may not be effective since most users stick with the default configuration. Additionally, existing patches like the one produced by Luke Dashjr do not address all cases, as spammers can find ways to bypass restrictions.Inscriptions, which embed themselves in the witness with a fee reduction, are considered a major spam attack. While other methods like using the op_return field can also be used to spam the chain, associated fees and the standardization rule limiting op_return to 80 bytes have prevented similar abuses. However, not taking action against inscriptions could be seen as acceptance by spammers, potentially leading to more spam attacks in the future.The lack of serious solutions to address the inscription problem may be due to the absence of available options. The real solution should tackle the issues of growing initial blockchain download time and the UTXO set. Rejecting inscriptions in the mempool of a node may lead to an endless chase as new inscriptions can be created. Inscriptions are primarily used for selling NFTs or tokens, concepts that the Bitcoin community has rejected. Although the community rejected concepts like sidechains, they still exist in a more centralized form.</p>
