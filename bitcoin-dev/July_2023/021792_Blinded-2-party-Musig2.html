    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context provided, the implementation of a version of 2-of-2 Schnorr Musig2 for statechains is being discussed. The goal is to have a server (referred to as party 1) that is fully 'blinded', meaning it can hold a private key but does not learn certain information. Specifically, party 1 should not learn the aggregate public key, the aggregate signature, or the message being signed.In the model of blinded statechains, the security relies on trusting the statechain server to report the number of partial signatures it has generated for a particular key. The full set of signatures generated is then verified client-side. The details of this can be found in the following link: [<a href="https://github.com/commerceblock/mercury/blob/master/doc/merc_blind.md">https://github.com/commerceblock/mercury/blob/master/doc/merc_blind.md</a>#blinding-considerations](<a href="https://github.com/commerceblock/mercury/blob/master/doc/merc_blind.md">https://github.com/commerceblock/mercury/blob/master/doc/merc_blind.md</a>#blinding-considerations)The 2-of-2 musig2 protocol operates as follows: Party 1 generates a private key (x1) and corresponding public key (X1 = x1G). Party 2 does the same with its private key (x2) and public key (X2 = x2G). The set of public keys is denoted as L = {X1, X2}. The key aggregation coefficient is calculated as KeyAggCoef(L, X) = H(L, X), where H is a cryptographic hash function. The shared (aggregate) public key is then obtained by multiplying the individual public keys with their respective coefficients: X = a1X1 + a2X2, where a1 = KeyAggCoef(L, X1) and a2 = KeyAggCoef(L, X2).To sign a message (m), both parties generate nonce values. Party 1 generates r1 and R1 = r1G, while Party 2 generates r2 and R2 = r2G. These nonces are then aggregated into R = R1 + R2.Next, both parties compute a 'challenge' value (c) using the shared public key (X), the aggregated nonce (R), and the message (m). In this case, party 1 does not need to independently compute and verify c since it is blinded from the message anyway. Party 1 computes s1 = c.a1.x1 + r1, while party 2 computes s2 = c.a2.x2 + r2.The final signature is obtained by combining the aggregated nonce (R) with the sum of the individual signatures: (R, s1 + s2).In the case of blinding for party 1, the following steps are taken:1) Key aggregation is performed only by party 2. Party 1 simply sends its public key (X1) to party 2.2) Nonce aggregation is also performed only by party 2. Party 1 sends its aggregated nonce (R1) to party 2.3) Party 2 computes the challenge value (c) using the shared public key (X), the aggregated nonce (R), and the message (m).</p>
