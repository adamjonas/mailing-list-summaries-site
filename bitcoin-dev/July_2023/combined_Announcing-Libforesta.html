        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Davidson Souza has introduced a new project called `libfloresta` to the Bitcoin devs mailing list. This project is a derivative of his previous work called `Floresta`, and it aims to create a compact and ready-to-use full node for Bitcoin on low-power devices like single-board computers (SBC) and smartphones. The main idea behind `libfloresta` is to provide an easily accessible solution for end users, and Davidson is writing the main logic of the project in Rust. By generating bindings to the original code and compiling it to WebAssembly (WASM), he ensures that `libfloresta` can run virtually anywhere.Although still in its early stages, `libfloresta` has been successfully used on signet without any issues. Davidson mentions that mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be resolved. He encourages users to check out the project on his GitHub page and provides an initial blog post explaining how to use `libfloresta` in Rust. As the project matures and becomes available on other platforms, Davidson plans to write more documentation.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and intends to incorporate the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. This approach minimizes the chances of misimplementations that could result in splits, although it does not guarantee consistency. To ensure compatibility, Davidson is cross-testing `libfloresta` against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they become problematic.Davidson expresses gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta. Overall, `libfloresta` is an exciting project that aims to provide a compact and ready-to-use full node for Bitcoin on low-power devices. Davidson is actively working on the project, welcomes feedback, and provides resources for users to explore and contribute to the project's development.</p>
