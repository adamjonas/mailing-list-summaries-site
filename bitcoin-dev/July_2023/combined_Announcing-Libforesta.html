        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Davidson Souza introduces a project called `libfloresta`, which is a fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main objective of this project is to create a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for low-power devices like single-board computers (SBC) and smartphones, although it can be used in any environment. To achieve this goal, Davidson is writing the main logic of the project in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere by compiling it to WebAssembly (WASM).The project is still in its early stages but has been successfully used on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but some performance issues with bridge nodes need to be resolved first. Davidson provides a link to the project's GitHub repository where the code is available, as well as a blog post that explains how to use the project in Rust. He plans to write more blog posts as the project matures and is deployed on other platforms. Feedback on the project is encouraged.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to utilize the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. While this approach does not guarantee consistency, it minimizes misimplementations that could lead to splits. Davidson also mentions that he is cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they cause any issues.Davidson concludes by expressing his gratitude to Vinteum for supporting his work with utreexo and Floresta. Overall, `libfloresta` is an exciting project that aims to provide a fully-validating Bitcoin full node with additional features for low-power devices. Davidson is actively working on the project, and any feedback is appreciated.</p>
