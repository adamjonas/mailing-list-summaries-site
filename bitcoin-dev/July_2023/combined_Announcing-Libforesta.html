        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Davidson Souza has introduced a project called `libfloresta` to the Bitcoin developer mailing list. `Libfloresta` is a compact, fully-validating Bitcoin full node that includes an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main objective of this project is to provide a ready-to-use full node for end users, especially on low-power devices like single-board computers (SBCs) and smartphones.To achieve this goal, Davidson is writing the main logic of the project in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere by compiling it to WebAssembly (WASM). Although the project is still in its early stages, it has been successfully used on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but some performance issues with bridge nodes need to be resolved first.Davidson has provided a link to the project's GitHub repository, where the code is available, as well as an initial blog post explaining how to use `libfloresta` in Rust. He plans to write more documentation as the project matures and becomes available on other platforms. Feedback on the project is welcome.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using existing libraries such as `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to utilize the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. This approach minimizes misimplementations that could lead to network splits. Davidson is also cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they become problematic.Davidson expresses his gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta.Overall, `libfloresta` is an exciting project that aims to provide a compact and ready-to-use full node for Bitcoin on low-power devices. Davidson is actively developing the project and welcomes feedback from the community.</p>
