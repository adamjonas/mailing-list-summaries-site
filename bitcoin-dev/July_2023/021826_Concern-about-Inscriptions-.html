    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of inscriptions and their impact on the Bitcoin network was raised. The argument was made that it is easier to detect and standardize these transactions than to create new types of spam transactions. It was noted that even if a new rule was implemented to prevent propagation of inscriptions to miners, users could still send non-standard transactions out of band or change the script used to embed an inscription. This would require constant updates to the rule by anti-inscription proponents, while pro-inscription users only need to convince others to update.The debate also touched on the effectiveness of standardization rules in general. Some argued that while rules like opreturn limits, maxancestorcount, minrelayfee, and dust limits can be circumvented by miners, they still serve as deterrents to spam attacks. However, others pointed out that the default policy can be both a weakness and a strength. If a patch is integrated into Bitcoin Core and activated by default, it becomes more effective as more nodes update.The issue of using pre-segwit nodes as a solution was also addressed, with the limitation being that these nodes cannot initiate new ones. The importance of economic factors in preventing inscriptions was emphasized, noting that the cost of blockspace needs to be higher than what inscribers are willing to pay. This can be achieved through Bitcoin becoming more useful or a lack of market demand for inscriptions.In response to concerns about tacit acceptance of inscription spam, it was argued that not taking action against inscriptions could encourage more similar attacks in the future. The proposal put forward was to consider adding a standardization option that allows the community to decide whether it should be activated. However, it was acknowledged that blocking inscriptions specifically could lead to a cat and mouse game where spammers find alternative methods.The discussion also referenced Satoshi Nakamoto's thoughts on spam in a link provided. However, it was noted that appeals to Satoshi are not compelling arguments.Overall, the conversation highlighted the challenges of addressing inscription spam and the need for a comprehensive solution that considers factors such as network standardization, economic incentives, and the growing UTXO set.</p>
