    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The protocol being discussed in the context is an interesting idea that involves incorporating a two-factor authentication (2FA) authentication through blind signing. Unlike traditional uses of blind signing, where the number of signatures is important, this protocol focuses on authorizing users through the 2FA procedure without considering the count of signatures. The blind-signing server's sole purpose is to verify the 2FA authentication.One potential issue with the protocol is the lack of checking K values against attacks. This vulnerability allows someone to extract the server's key from one signing operation by manipulating the values. By setting K1 = K1' - K2 (where K1' is the secret key), an attack can calculate x and derive x2 = x - x1. The details of this attack are explained in a GitHub gist provided in the message.The sender of the email proposes a solution to the blinding issue in the protocol using a mathematical approach. The solution involves adding the values X1 and X2 to obtain X, and then calculating R as the sum of K1, K2, and bX, where b is a randomly chosen value. The hash function is used to compute e based on R, X, and m. The process continues with further calculations to obtain the final signature sG. Verification of the signature involves subtracting eX from sG and comparing the resulting hash value with the computed hash value ev.The sender requests a review of the proposed solution and expresses the need for feedback. The discussion thread also includes a separate message that raises a concern about a missing blinding step in the protocol, which could potentially allow the server to obtain information about the client's message.</p>
