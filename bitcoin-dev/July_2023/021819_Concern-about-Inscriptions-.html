    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issue of spam attacks on the Bitcoin network, specifically through the use of inscriptions, has been a topic of discussion. Some individuals do not consider inscriptions as spam and argue against blocking them, viewing it as censorship that could lead to the blocking of regular transactions based on other criteria in the future. This perspective is supported by the fact that various types of data, including images, files, and even the entire Bitcoin whitepaper, have been uploaded onto the blockchain using different methods.The argument is made that simply blocking inscriptions without addressing the underlying problems, such as the Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) time and the growing Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, would not be effective. Blocking inscriptions could potentially lead to the use of alternative methods to push data onto the blockchain, thus requiring additional code to strip the data correctly. It is also noted that the use of Taproot can still allow for the uploading of large amounts of data, which can be addressed by turning off the witness and becoming a pre-Segwit node.A proposal is made to add a standardization option without implementing a soft fork. This option would give the community the choice to activate or deactivate the option. However, it is argued that adding settings may not be effective, as most people tend to use the default node configuration. Furthermore, it is pointed out that existing solutions, such as a patch produced by Luke Dashjr, do not address all cases and can easily be bypassed by spammers. The suggestion is made that finding a solution to the inscription issue requires addressing the larger problems of IBD time and UTXO size.In response to questions regarding why the issue of inscriptions has not been addressed more seriously, it is explained that if there are no good solutions available, the status quo is maintained. The issue of inscriptions is seen as part of a larger problem related to the growing initial blockchain download time and UTXO set. The lack of options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node is attributed to the belief that it would lead to an endless chase, with new methods of spamming replacing blocked inscriptions.It is noted that inscriptions are primarily used for selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or tokens, concepts that have been consistently rejected by the Bitcoin community. However, it is pointed out that certain concepts, such as sidechains and soft forks, have persisted in different forms despite initial rejection. The creators of inscriptions believe their rules are followed, but in reality, valid Bitcoin transactions can be created that are also invalid Ordinals transactions due to the lack of enforcement by miners and nodes.Overall, the issue of inscriptions as a form of spam on the Bitcoin network is complex and intertwined with larger challenges related to blockchain download time and UTXO size. Various perspectives exist regarding whether or not to block inscriptions, with arguments made for addressing the underlying problems rather than implementing specific restrictions.</p>
