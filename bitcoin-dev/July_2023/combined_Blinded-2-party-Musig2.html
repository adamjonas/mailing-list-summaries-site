        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a version of 2-of-2 Schnorr Musig2 for statechains. The focus is on party 1, which is the server in the 2-of-2 setup. The goal is to ensure that party 1 remains fully blinded and does not learn the aggregate public key, the aggregate signature, or the message being signed.The protocol involves party 1 generating a private key (x1) and a corresponding public key (X1). Party 2 generates its own private key (x2) and public key (X2). The set of public keys is denoted as L = {X1, X2}. The key aggregation coefficient is computed as KeyAggCoef(L, X) = H(L, X), and the shared (aggregate) public key is calculated as X = a1X1 + a2X2, where a1 = KeyAggCoef(L, X1) and a2 = KeyAggCoef(L, X2).To sign a message (m), party 1 generates a nonce (r1) and computes R1 = r1G. Party 2 does the same with its own nonce (r2) to obtain R2 = r2G. The nonces are then aggregated into R = R1 + R2.Party 1 computes the challenge (c) as c = H(X||R||m) and calculates s1 = c.a1.x1 + r1. Similarly, party 2 computes the challenge (c) as c = H(X||R||m) and calculates s2 = c.a2.x2 + r2.The final signature is represented as (R, s1+s2).In the case of blinding party 1, several steps are taken to prevent it from learning the final values. First, key aggregation is performed only by party 2, with party 1 simply sending its public key (X1) to party 2. Similarly, nonce aggregation is performed only by party 2, with party 1 sending its nonce (R1) to party 2. Finally, party 2 computes the challenge (c) and sends it to party 1 for the computation of s1 = c.a1.x1 + r1.The important point is that party 1 never learns the final value of (R, s1+s2) or the message (m).Some potential issues are raised in the discussion. One concern is whether the blinding step is sufficient to prevent party 1 from learning the preimage for the received challenge (c), including the message (m). Another issue is the vulnerability of the scheme to attacks when party 2 is composed of multiple parties. The current scheme has only one nonce (R) per party, which may make it susceptible to specific attacks.To address these concerns, suggestions are made to modify the scheme. One proposal involves having all parties provide a proof of their secret key along with their public key. Another suggestion is to use a two-step process where parties provide a commitment to their public key, which is revealed only after the commitment is received. Combining both approaches is also mentioned as a possibility.Overall, the discussion highlights the considerations and potential challenges involved in implementing a blinded version of 2-of-2 Schnorr Musig2 for statechains.</p>
