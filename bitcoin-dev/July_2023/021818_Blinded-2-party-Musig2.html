    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of preventing attacks in blind signing services was brought up. One participant highlighted that not having proof of knowledge of each R (ephemeral keys) used in generating the signatures does not prevent Wagner's attack. They suggested that a generic blind signing service would be sufficient for blinded signature schemes like MuSig, MuSig2, FROST, etc., without the blind signing service knowing about them.The participant explained that there is no need for a specialized MuSig2 blind signing service to extract MuSig2 compatible shares. Instead, the MuSig tweak and/or BIP32 can be added to the key during the blind signing request. They also noted that having multiple nonces in the server, as in MuSig2, does not improve the server's security. The main challenge seems to be creating a secure blind Schnorr signing service, with references to papers mentioned by Jonas that explain how to achieve this.Another participant clarified that proving knowledge of the r values (ephemeral keys) used to generate each R can prevent the Wagner attack. However, it was pointed out that none of the attacks mentioned in the thread so far, including attacks on nonces and the challenge c, can be prevented by proving knowledge of the signing key (proof of possession).Overall, the discussion revolves around finding ways to enhance the security of blind signing services and integrate secure blind Schnorr signing techniques into protocols.</p>
