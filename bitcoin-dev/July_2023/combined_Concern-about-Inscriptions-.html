        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The issue of inscriptions in the Bitcoin network has not been addressed seriously, as there are currently no viable options available. The default response in the event of a compromise to the ECDSA algorithm would be to do nothing and wait for a backward-compatible solution. However, this lack of action could be interpreted as tacit acceptance by spammers, leading to more similar attacks in the future.Although inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts rejected by the Bitcoin community, they pose significant challenges. These inscriptions can embed themselves in the witness and reduce fees, making them a form of spam. While the standardization rule limiting op_return to 80 bytes has prevented similar abuses, inscriptions remain a problem.The proposal to reject inscriptions in the mempool does not involve implementing a soft fork but rather suggests adding a standardization option. This would allow the community to decide whether to activate it or not. However, simply adding settings won't be effective, as most people use the default configuration and alternative methods can easily bypass restrictions.The absence of options to reject inscriptions in the mempool is due to the complexity of the problem. Blocking one type of inscription would lead to the creation of different ones, and inscriptions can exist even on chains without Taproot or Segwit. Addressing the spam attack caused by inscriptions requires considering the underlying issues, such as the growing download time of the initial blockchain and the increasing size of the UTXO set.Inscriptions have rapidly grown in size on the blockchain, causing issues with the UTXO set and the daily growth of the blockchain. While discussions continue regarding the nature of these inscriptions, they are viewed by some as spam due to their recurring nature and negative impact on the network. It is important to find a solution that takes into account the potential consequences and implications for the Bitcoin network.</p>
