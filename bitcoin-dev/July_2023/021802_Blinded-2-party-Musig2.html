    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, users @ZmnSCPxj and @Tom are discussing the potential vulnerabilities of blind MuSig schemes. @ZmnSCPxj suggests that to avoid an attack called "Wagner," the third round of MuSig1, which involves R commitments, should be implemented. @Tom clarifies that the conversation is focused on MuSig1, not MuSig2. @Jonas provides a detailed response, addressing the concerns raised by @Tom. He explains that blind MuSig is still an open research problem and points out that the proposed scheme aims to prevent the server from signing more than the agreed number of times. However, he warns that skipping the nonce commitment round or not determining the message before sending the nonce can make MuSig1 vulnerable to an attack. He outlines a potential attack scenario where a malicious client obtains R-values from the server and manipulates them to create a valid signature. To address these issues, @Jonas suggests an alternative scheme. In this scheme, the client sends a commitment to the public key, nonce, and message to the server. The server replies with its own nonce. The client then proves in zero knowledge that the commitment matches the computed hash. Finally, the server sends the signed value based on the provided information.It is important to note that @Jonas acknowledges that his suggestion is based on initial intuition and may require further exploration.The conversation concludes with the original email header and contact information.Overall, the discussion revolves around the vulnerabilities and possible solutions related to blind MuSig schemes, particularly MuSig1, highlighting the need for further research in this area.</p>
