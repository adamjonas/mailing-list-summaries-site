    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the issue of judging which transactions should be allowed on the network. It suggests that it would be better if all transactions were indistinguishable from each other in terms of privacy and censorship resistance. The author argues that limited resources on the blockchain should go to the highest bidder, as this is how the network ensures its security. Instead of considering these transactions as "spam," the author proposes thinking about them objectively in terms of their value to the marketplace (fees they're willing to pay) versus the cost to the network (storage consumed). The author also mentions that if the rate of growth of the blockchain is too high, it is not the fault of Ordinals but rather the lack of sufficient limitations on the amount of storage that can be added per block.</p>
