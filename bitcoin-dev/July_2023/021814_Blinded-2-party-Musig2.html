    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, moonsettler proposed a protocol that incorporates two-factor authentication (2FA) into blind signing. The basic idea is to use 2FA as a means of authorization for blind signing, with a blind-signing server solely responsible for verifying the 2FA. Unlike traditional uses of blind signing where the number of signatures matters, this protocol allows the blind-signing server to sign any request as long as the requester is authorized through the 2FA procedure.However, one participant named AdamISZ pointed out a potential vulnerability in the protocol. AdamISZ highlighted that the protocol does not check K values against attacks, which could enable an attacker to extract the server's key from a single signing. By manipulating the values in the protocol, an attacker could derive the private key used by the blind-signing server and potentially steal coins.To illustrate the vulnerability, AdamISZ provided a step-by-step example in the discussion thread. They referred to moonsettler's original protocol in a GitHub gist and explained how an attacker could calculate the private key by exploiting the lack of checks in the protocol.Another participant named Jonas Nick also raised a concern about a missing blinding step in the protocol. They mentioned that if the server (party 1) receives a value c during the signature protocol, it could potentially scan the blockchain for signatures, compute corresponding hashes, and compare them to the received value c. If there is a match, the server would have access to the preimage for c, including the message being signed.Overall, the discussion focused on analyzing the proposed protocol and identifying potential vulnerabilities and improvements. The participants shared their insights and observations to help refine the protocol and address the security concerns raised.</p>
