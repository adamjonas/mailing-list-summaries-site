    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and Amir in 2011, the topic of using firstbits in the Bitcoin protocol was discussed. Jorge expressed his dislike for the proposal if it had to rely on servers, as it doesn't scale well and can fill up the blockchain with unnecessary data. However, he did acknowledge that firstbits can still be useful for QR codes, such as in the case of green addresses' POS instant payments.Amir originally pointed out the scalability issues with firstbits and how it can harm each Bitcoin node by filling up the blockchain with a ton of crap to register even a single satoshi at an address. Jorge suggested using namecoin as an alternative solution, which could be easier to decentralize. However, Matt argued that even if a chain specifically crafted for this purpose were to be used, it still wouldn't scale well and would require trusted servers to function effectively. In such a case, an HTTPS/DNSSEC-based implementation would be more practical.</p>
