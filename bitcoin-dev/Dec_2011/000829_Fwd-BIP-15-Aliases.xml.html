    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Namecoin is a form of cryptocurrency that uses the same private keys as Bitcoin. It is also the only secure and globally unique human-rememberable string system in existence. The suggestion is made to use Namecoin names as a way to send bitcoins since Namecoin has started merged mining. The convenience for end-users is highlighted as a major advantage over other technologies such as HTTPS/DNSSEC, which have been around for a longer time and are responsible for many mission-critical systems. However, proposals for Namecoin could make Bitcoin implementations dependent on unproven technology, and there is a chance that Namecoin could die tomorrow. A specific example is given of how Namecoin can be used for making payments without requiring a mobile phone or a QR code.
