    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In December 2011, Eric Lombrozo posted on a thread inquiring about the part of an email message used to identify the thread to which it belongs. He noted that he had made a couple of recent posts that were intended for the protocol extensions thread but were instead put in new threads. To clarify the confusion, Eric asked which part of the email message was used for identification purposes. In response, a link to a webpage explaining how email threading works was provided. The page explains that email threading is the process of grouping emails with the same topic together. It goes on to explain that different email clients use different methods to determine which messages belong to a particular thread. Some use the subject line, while others use the In-Reply-To or References header fields.Overall, Eric's post and subsequent response shed light on the intricacies of email threading and the importance of understanding how different email clients handle it to ensure proper communication.</p>
