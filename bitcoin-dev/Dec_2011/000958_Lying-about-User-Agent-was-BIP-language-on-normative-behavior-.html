    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 19, 2011, Gregory Maxwell and Luke-JR were discussing on IRC about BIP_0014. Gavin's recent commit had used the same version string for the GUI interface and the daemon mode which led to the argument. Luke believed that it was a violation of BIP_0014 and an error in judgement on Gavin's part as it failed to conform to the community-adopted standard. However, he clarified that he believes lying about the client is a violation. Gavin's commit intentionally reports "bitcoin-qt" for bitcoind, which is not compliant. Luke further stated that there isn't anything that says a version must be reported at all, let alone for a specific component, so it could comply by leaving that part off. But if there is a common part, it certainly isn't Bitcoin-Qt. A fix was presented in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715</a> which would fulfil everyone's desires. Gavin wanted security by obscurity by making bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt indistinguishable, and this would be achieved with pull #715.</p>
