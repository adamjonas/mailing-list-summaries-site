    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion involves the idea of creating alias systems that are focused on improving usability in bitcoin address schemes and supporting plugins to extend those schemes. The IIBAN scheme is proposed, and Payward Inc. envisions many parties, including individuals or small groups of individuals, operating individual Bitcoin-related services, registering as institutions within the IIBAN registry. Each such party may define its mapping system between Bitcoin, LETS or other alternate currency financial endpoints that it manages and IIBAN within its namespace. Institutions are important as they provide benefits in terms of managing decentralized virtual currencies such as Bitcoin for users requiring instantaneous financial settlement. The idea is that many institutions each provide mappings between IIBAN and Bitcoin in a range of ways, and there is no suggestion that Bitcoin developers should implement a hard-coded mechanism. In this proposed scheme, there is no central organization that maps IIBAN account numbers to domain names. Instead, under the IIBAN recommendation, IANA would publish the registry of IIBAN institutions for everyone to use without the need to query any party. Various settlement-system neutral transaction-related metadata would then be exchanged prior to any actual transaction. Such metadata could include aspects of the transaction such as description, financial system endpoint holder name, account exists verification, etc.</p>
