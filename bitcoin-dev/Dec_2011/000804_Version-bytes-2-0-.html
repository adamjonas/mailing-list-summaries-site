    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sipa's specification for version numbers has been criticized for overlooking an important factor: usability in base58 encoding. The current version for script-based addresses (2) makes it complicated for end-users as these addresses, once encoded, may begin with any of the following characters: 2opqrstuvwxyz. In response to this, Luke has proposed a new specification that defines network class, network, and data class using different bits. The proposed specification assigns two first-class "networks" besides Bitcoin, addresses starting with '7' and 'E' (pubkey), and '9' and 'F' (script). Luke suggests making merged mining support a requirement except for networks that have a proven-better proof-of-work (ie, NOT scrypt). Other networks can use the "other" value (thus beginning with 'L' and 'N') and a second octet (which can be divided up later).</p>
