    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the need for a way for merchants to convert human-readable and writable addresses into bitcoin addresses. The use of fixed addresses is not ideal as it could expose sensitive information like income, and addresses should be used once for a single transaction to track payments. Firstbits and DNS are also not practical for generating per-transaction addresses due to caching and propagation issues. HTTP(S) is suggested as the best option since merchants are already using it for their shops. A simple HTTP(S) request to a merchant-specified URL that returns an ASCII document containing either a bitcoin: URI or the bitcoin address, or even a 301 redirect is proposed. Merchants can then decide if they prefer per-transaction addresses, per-user transactions, fixed addresses, or any combination. HTTPS is deemed the easiest to implement, followed by HTTP and DNS, respectively. To request a full public key, an HTTPS request can be made, and the resulting public key can be turned into an address before creating a transaction. The email also comments on the readability of the BIP and suggests making it more accessible.</p>
