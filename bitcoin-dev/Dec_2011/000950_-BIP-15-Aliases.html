    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the speaker expresses uncertainty about JSON and suggests using protocol buffers instead. The speaker is unsure if protocol buffers would be too difficult for developers to use. Protocol buffers is a language-agnostic way of serializing structured data developed by Google. It is designed to be more compact and faster than JSON or XML.Using protocol buffers could potentially be beneficial as it offers advantages over JSON in terms of speed and efficiency. Protocol buffers can also help reduce the size of transmitted data. However, some developers may find it more complex to work with compared to JSON.Despite these potential advantages, it is unclear whether protocol buffers would be a suitable replacement for JSON in all cases. Ultimately, the decision to use one over the other will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the developers and the project at hand.Overall, the speaker raises an interesting point about the potential benefits of using protocol buffers over JSON, but acknowledges that it may not be the best solution for every situation.</p>
