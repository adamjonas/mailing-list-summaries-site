    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The IETF does not specify anything in the PATH part of the URI. Although it specifies the scheme, there are many types of URI schemes. It is beneficial to have your own scheme and have apps understand how to integrate with it. Having just one client hinders acceptance and participation. If you want to go the route of https then specifying a scheme is your path forward. The experience that leads this thread down the rat-hole of CGI and HTTP requests is just what people are used to. The stuff isn't magic. Reviewing the bitcoin protocol reveals an elegance not found in the https schemes proposed thus far. CGI isn't a protocol, nor does it address usability/identity issues. Providing a mapping from user at authority.tld addresses usability and identity. An elegant transformation is needed for anyone advocating <a href="https://authority/foo/user?tx=1zhd789632uilos">https://authority/foo/user?tx=1zhd789632uilos</a>.</p>
