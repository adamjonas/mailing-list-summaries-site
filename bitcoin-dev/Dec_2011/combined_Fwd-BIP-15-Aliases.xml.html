    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Namecoin is a peer-to-peer system that maps names to values in a fully decentralized way. It is not limited to .bit usage and can be used to map names to other things, such as a public bitcoin address or URL. When using other systems like DNS and HTTP(S) as the first entry point, one won't have all the advantages of Namecoin. However, constructing a zero-trust or nearly zero-trust Namecoin resolver without having a copy of the complete Namecoin block chain is challenging. The Bitcoin lite node mechanism is not suitable because a peer could return stale records or no-result, and there would be no evidence of their deception.Interaction is necessary to generate a temporary address, but not necessarily directly with the entity hosting the wallet. EC crypto tricks, often mentioned under "deterministic wallets," can be used. The wallet-hosting entity has a private key x with public key X. The address-generating entity knows X and generates a fresh private key y for each transaction. For each, it calculates Z=y*X and asks the client to pay to hash160(Z). Afterward, it can send a bunch of y's to the wallet hosting service, which can reconstruct z=y*x for each. Alternatively, the y's can be generated according to a predefined scheme.</p>
