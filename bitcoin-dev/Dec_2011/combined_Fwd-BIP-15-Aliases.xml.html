    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Namecoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer name/value datastore system. It is designed to map names to other things such as public bitcoin addresses and URLs. However, directly mapping things to .bit URLs would not be the optimal way of using Namecoin. Using DNS and HTTP(S) as the first entry point would not provide all the advantages of Namecoin. Constructing a zero-trust or nearly zero trust Namecoin resolver without having a copy of the complete Namecoin block chain is a challenge. The bitcoin lite node mechanism will not work because a peer could return stale records or no-result with no evidence of their deception. Interaction is necessary for preserving anonymity through the use of temporary addresses. The issuing of a new address cannot be done without interacting with the entity hosting the wallet. However, there are some EC crypto tricks that can be used, often mentioned under "deterministic wallets." The wallet-hosting entity has a private key x with public key X. The address-generating entity knows X and generates a fresh private key y for each transaction. It calculates Z=y*X, and asks the client to pay to hash160(Z). Afterwards, it can send a bunch of y's to the wallet hosting service, which can reconstruct z=y*x for each. Alternatively, the y's can be generated according to a predefined scheme instead.</p>
