        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>John Smith recently announced in a mailing list message that he had closed some old Github issues over the weekend. These issues were either not reproducible in recent versions or needed input from the submitter but had been stalling for months. He also mentioned closing some Wx UI issues and stated that they no longer support the old UI. John suggested that someone could take up wxBitcoin, but it's no longer their issue.He emphasized that there is no "main project," and all non-functional clients should be given equal footing. However, some of the older issues are still relevant, but 150+ open issues are not something to be proud of. In another discussion about the wxBitcoin project, someone suggests that it would be ideal if someone took up the project after backporting to wx 2.8. The issue of whether or not it should be in the main project is brought up, with one person cautioning against a centralization mindset. However, the term "main project" is clarified to refer specifically to the issue list of bitcoin/bitcoin on Github, and not the forks which have their own issue lists.The conversation then shifts to how other open source projects deal with similar issues without stepping on people's toes. They express concern about avoiding a situation where certain contributors or projects receive more attention than others.</p>
