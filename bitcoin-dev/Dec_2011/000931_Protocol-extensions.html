    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the potential for improving the Bitcoin protocol by breaking up its tasks into separate components that can run independently on different types of devices. One proposal is to move towards a distributed hash table for block chain storage and perform database queries using the Bitcoin protocol itself. The author suggests adding new commands to perform more sophisticated queries and proposes a new network services type for nodes serving as block chain/transaction pool storage. However, anonymity concerns are raised in relation to implementing such features as they break anonymity and encourage people to participate in the peer-to-peer network. Additionally, it is noted that intermediate routing like Tor would slow down the system, so the focus should be on performance rather than anonymity when dealing with distributed hash tables. Other ideas for additional types of services are also mentioned, and the author expresses interest in developing these ideas further and helping to put together some specifications.</p>
