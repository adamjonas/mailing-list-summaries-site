        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Gavin Andresen, a prominent developer for Bitcoin, recently posted in the forums about a remote vulnerability that was reported by a user named makomk. The vulnerability affected those who had pulled and compiled their own bitcoind/bitcoin-qt from the source tree in the last 5 days. The vulnerability was caused by a mistake made while refactoring the ConnectInputs() function into two pieces (FetchInputs() and ConnectInputs()). A check for an out-of-range previous-transaction-output in the FetchInputs() method was not duplicated in ConnectInputs(), which resulted in a new method called AreInputsStandard() crashing with an out-of-bounds memory access if given an invalid transaction. The bug-fix puts a check in FetchInputs() and an assertion in AreInputsStandard(). However, this does not affect the back-ported "mining only" code that some miners and pools are using. Although the vulnerability was found and reported before binaries with the vulnerability were released, it could have made it into the next release if makomk had not been testing some unrelated code. Before releasing version 0.6, Gavin Andresen would like to have an "intelligent, bitcoin-specific fuzzing tool" that can automatically find this type of bug that they can run before every release. He has asked if anyone already has one to speak up.Overall, Andresen's post highlights the importance of testing and finding vulnerabilities before releasing updates to ensure users are protected. Those running git-HEAD code on the production network should pull the latest code to get the bug fixed.</p>
