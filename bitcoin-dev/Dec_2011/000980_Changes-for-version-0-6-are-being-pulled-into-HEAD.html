    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2011, Jeff Garzik wrote an email expressing his disagreement with a change proposed by Luke-Jr for the 0.6 version of a software. Luke-Jr had submitted a pull request for a change related to coinbaser which he claimed was already accepted for the update. However, Garzik disputed this and reminded Luke-Jr that he needed buy-in from other miners before making any changes. Additionally, Garzik asserted that the decision should not be based on what "you" want, but rather what "they" want. Luke-Jr responded by stating that there was already support from other miners for the change and that Gavin had approved it on IRC the day before.</p>
