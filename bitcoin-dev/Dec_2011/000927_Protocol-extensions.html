    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post from 2011, user theymos proposed a solution to handle scalability in the future of Bitcoin. The proposal involved lightweight clients downloading only headers and Merkle trees which are both small and easy to distribute. They would then require senders to directly contact recipients in order to transmit their transactions. This would mean that lightweight clients would never need full blocks to build their balances, and full nodes wouldn't have to handle expensive queries from lightweight clients. While the idea is interesting, it's unclear if there are any drawbacks to this approach.</p>
