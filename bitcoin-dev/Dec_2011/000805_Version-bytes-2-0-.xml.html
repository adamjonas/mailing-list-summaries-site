    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The first part of the context discusses a proposal to address issues found in the Bitcoin specification. These issues include public keys beginning with '2', which is the same as testnet data, and signatures and private keys starting with the same character in the "aux" network. The proposed solution involves defining the network class using bits 128/64, with both script hashes and raw public keys beginning with '3'. A table of version number to first-base58-char mappings is also provided for reference.The second part of the context describes a list of 64 hexadecimal values that represent 8-bit binary codes used to encode various types of data or instructions. These codes can represent characters, symbols, numeric values, and control codes. The first bit in each code is a flag bit that indicates whether the code belongs to the ASCII standard or not. If the flag bit is 0, the code is part of the ASCII standard, otherwise it is not. The remaining seven bits are used to represent the actual data.The ASCII standard is widely used in computer systems and communication protocols, assigning unique codes to characters and symbols commonly used in the English language. It includes codes for uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control codes such as carriage return and line feed. However, the non-ASCII codes in the given context may belong to other character encoding systems, such as Unicode, which support a much larger set of characters and symbols from various languages and scripts. Some of the non-ASCII codes may also be used to represent specialized control codes or data formats in specific applications.</p>
