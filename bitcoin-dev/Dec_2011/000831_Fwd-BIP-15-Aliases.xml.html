    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author recounts their experience at brmlab where they attempted to pay for a Club Mate using Bitcoin but could not scan the QR code as they did not have a mobile phone. The author argues that fixed addresses like this are not ideal as they can lead to merchants exposing private data, and proposes an alternative solution for large-scale deployment, such as requesting full public keys with HTTPS requests. The author notes that FirstBits is not a viable option due to privacy concerns and suggests that the BIP is difficult to read. They conclude by stating that HTTPS would be the simplest approach for implementing Bitcoin payments.</p>
