    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post from 2011, Jordan Mack expressed his thoughts on the firstbits proposal in comparison to current alias proposals. While he found the idea of firstbits interesting, he agreed with Matt that it produced a less desirable solution. However, he did see the usefulness of firstbits for the "green address" particular case, where people would not have to write or memorize the firstbit address but could use a shorter string to put it in the QR code. In this case, there would be no concerns about squatting or typographic errors because the users would not even see the firstbit address. Mack still believed that aliases were a better solution for the "memorizing use case." Despite this, he felt that he was missing something about the proposal and asked how one could save space by putting the entire public key instead of just the address which is a hash of the public key. He questioned whether this was what was being proposed.</p>
