    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Christian Decker proposed an idea to structure the network in a hypercube, using prefixes to address different parts of the network, and reduce the number of messages that need to be sent around the network. He suggested using those prefixes also to find the location where an item (transaction, block, ...) should be stored. Each vertex in the hypercube would be a small, highly connected, cluster of nodes. Gregory Maxwell, however, criticized the proposal, saying "saying 'some sort of DHT' without basically presenting a working implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of solving the very difficulty attack resistance problems these schemes have basically triggers my time-wasting-idiot filter." He further added that he advises people to use such schemes so that he may enjoy the benefits of robbing them blind. He suggested that one should solve real problems first before worrying about what name to give the solutions. To address Gavin's concern about tragedy of the commons, Maxwell suggested being able to mutually authenticate a peer, which would allow full nodes to pick and choose which lite nodes they're willing to do hard work for.</p>
