        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2011, Amir Taaki brought up a concern regarding the functionality of UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on Bitcoin's daemon. This issue was also discussed by Sipa and Gmaxwell, who speculated that the protocol might no longer be working. However, there was no way to test this theory at the time.To troubleshoot the problem, Taaki decided to create an alternate chain and run the daemon on his VPS (Virtual Private Server). While doing so, he noticed that the connections were sometimes accepted, but other times they were not due to inconsistent behavior. Another participant in the discussion, Matt, suggested that the problem might lie in the failure to re-announce to the router that the port needs to remain open.During a conversation on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), Sipa and Gmaxwell continued to speculate about the possible dysfunction of UPnP. Despite the lack of a definitive way to test this theory, Taaki wanted to share his experience with others, highlighting the patchy acceptance of connections while running the Bitcoin daemon on his VPS.Overall, the discussion revolved around the potential issues with UPnP in Bitcoin's daemon, with contributors sharing their observations and theories about the protocol's functionality. The inconsistent behavior of connection acceptance raised concerns, prompting further examination and exploration of the situation.</p>
