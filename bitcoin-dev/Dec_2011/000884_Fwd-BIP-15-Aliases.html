    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Namecoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer generic name/value datastore system. It is specifically designed to map names to other things in a fully decentralized way. Namecoin uses a system of namespaces to separate each usage, like the "personal namespace" draft that could be extended to support mapping to a bitcoin address. The technology used by Namecoin is as secure as Bitcoin and merged mining provides a secure network. There are no single points of failure with Namecoin, unlike DNS and HTTP(S) which have several limitations. Namecoin allows additional security by adding a certificate fingerprint combined with an HTTPS URL. Namecoin is easily connectable to Bitcoin, as they both use RPC and JSON to exchange information, so connecting one to the other is really easy. For example, Bitcoin could even allow registration of names by sending an RPC request to Namecoin. The protocol is extensible, so other methods to get bitcoins addresses can be added later. Anyone can register their own name using the Namecoin software or by using a name provider. Additionally, anyone can become a name provider to register for their friends and resell names. Namecoin provides proven technology and is not limited to .bit usage. Namecoin needs only Namecoin to store data, whereas dot-bit domains need dot-bit compatible DNS servers or proxies + Namecoin and have small visibility due to the nature of top-to-bottom domain name systems controlled by ICANN. There are several examples of possible registered names in Namecoin with the "personal namespace." These include an individual person with well-known public addresses, a merchant accepting payments in bitcoin, Namecoin, PayPal, or other coins, and a merchant with a public address, a URL to generate custom addresses, and a domain name. In Bitcoin, there are several possibilities of address syntax such as khal, khal at dot-bit.org, mymerchant.com, mymerchant2, etc. When people put an address to pay to in the Bitcoin client, RPC is made to Namecoin for the corresponding prefix (p/khal or p/mymerchant.com). The JSON processing is done for the prefix to get the bitcoin address and other information like URL and fingerprints. If there is an HTTPS request to be made, it is made using the URL obtained from JSON processing.</p>
