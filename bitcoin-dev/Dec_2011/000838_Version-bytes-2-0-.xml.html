    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation dated December 13, 2011, Mike Hearn expressed his hopes that Matt's change would get merged soon to resolve the issue of how people can find out about Bitcoin capabilities. He notes that it won't be practical to expect people to learn how to create Bitcoin links manually. A solution to this problem is included in Bitcoin-Qt 0.6 which has a QR Code generator. However, Hearn disagrees with the notion that all modern operating systems support copy/paste and drag/drop of rich content. In his experience, dragging and dropping links often leads to corruption.</p>
