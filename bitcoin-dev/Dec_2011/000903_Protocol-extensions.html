    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Eric Lombrozo proposed an idea to break up the different tasks of block chain management into separate components that can run as independent services on various devices. He suggested a new network service type for nodes that serve as block chain/transaction pool storage and proposed an extension to the Bitcoin protocol to provide methods for performing more sophisticated queries. Furthermore, he proposed using a distributed hash table instead of sequential disk files to store block chains. Michael Grønager responded to Eric’s proposal, agreeing with him about moving towards DHT based storage but also pointed out the need to be careful with this approach and to work out the fraction of the blockchain that each client needs to store in order to ensure similar service levels. Chris had previously proposed a similar idea to the DHT, with his goal being to reduce the need for broadcasts. He suggested structuring the network in a hypercube and using prefixes to address different parts of the network, and use those prefixes also to find the location where an item (transaction, block, ...) should be stored.</p>
