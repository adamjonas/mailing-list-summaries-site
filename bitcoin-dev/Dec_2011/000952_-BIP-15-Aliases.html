    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion started with Jordan Mack expressing confusion regarding alias resolution in Bitcoin, and how binary data fits into the process. It was explained that not all payment outputs can be serialized into addresses, and it would be broken-by-design to assume they could be. Sending the script directly instead of sending the user's software "pay to address foo" reduces possible problems and ensures that it still works fine even if the user's client doesn't support version 255 addresses.Regarding JSON-RPC, it was argued that while it serves a purpose in terms of developer accessibility, it is not problem-free at high-level either. One of the issues is that almost every implementation of JSON treats Numbers differently based on whether they have a '.' in them or not. MIME, on the other hand, has been around for much longer and should have sufficient support in every language by now. The module for MIME in Python is called 'email'.</p>
