    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2011, a discussion was held in the Bitcoin community regarding the slow downloading of blockchain over Tor and its impact on network load. A freenet plugin for blockchain distribution was proposed as a solution to this issue. It was suggested that Freenet's decentralized storage system could be used for faster requesting of much-needed keys. The "btcfn" specification for this purpose was developed in 2010. However, progress on the project had slowed down due to other people supposedly working on it. The suggestion was made to outsource these features to established systems, both because it is challenging and for "hiding traffic in the masses."</p>
