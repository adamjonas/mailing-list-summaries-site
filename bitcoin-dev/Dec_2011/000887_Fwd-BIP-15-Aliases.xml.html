    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated December 16, 2011, Khalahan explains that Namecoin is a peer-to-peer generic name/value datastore system that is not limited to .bit usage. He notes that directly mapping things to .bit URL would not be the optimal way of using Namecoin. Namecoin is specifically designed to map names to other things in a fully decentralized way and is the perfect starting point to map names to public Bitcoin addresses, URLs, and more. When using other systems like DNS and HTTP(S) as the first entry point, one won't have all the advantages of Namecoin.The email thread then goes on to ask how one can construct a zero-trust (or nearly zero trust) Namecoin resolver without having a copy of the complete Namecoin block chain, which is ever-growing. The bitcoin lite node mechanism will not work because a peer could return stale records or no-result, and there would be no evidence of their deception. In the case of lite bitcoin nodes, telling you about old transactions is harmless because you control your own transactions.</p>
