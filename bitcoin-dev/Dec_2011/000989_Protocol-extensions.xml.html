    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Andy Parkins questioned why nodes should be forced to do their job properly. Joel responded that if a node does not check transactions, it cannot reliably forward failed verifications without getting blamed for doing faulty work. Nodes that don't do any checking will have no incentive to relay the failed verifications, which makes it important to know which nodes are checking and which ones are not. This is to avoid isolating oneself from other nodes that are also checking transactions. There is still no implicit trust in the system, but negative announcements are checked, and if a node is incorrectly negative-announcing, it can be kicked out.</p>
