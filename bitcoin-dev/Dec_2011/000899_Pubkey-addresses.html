    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests that public key addresses should be standardized and supported. Although these addresses are not user-friendly due to their length, they are better suited for large QR codes. The use of QR codes is becoming increasingly popular in many applications, including contactless payment systems and airline boarding passes. Therefore, it is important to have a standardized method for representing public key addresses in QR codes to ensure compatibility across different platforms. In addition to standardizing public key addresses, there are also efforts to improve the usability of these addresses for humans. One approach is to use domain names as a way to represent public keys, which would make them easier to remember and share. However, this approach has its own challenges, such as ensuring the authenticity of the domain name and preventing phishing attacks. Overall, the adoption of standardized public key addresses would benefit the development of secure and interoperable systems that rely on cryptography. As technology continues to advance, it is important to keep up with these developments and ensure that our systems are designed with security and usability in mind.</p>
