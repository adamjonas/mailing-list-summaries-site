    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On December 21, 2011, Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr discussed the acceptance of Coinbaser for version 0.6 of Bitcoin software. Luke-Jr had claimed that Gavin had accepted it before the discussion. However, Jeff Garzik disagreed and said that Luke-Jr needed to get buy-in from other miners to ensure that the proposal was not just his personal preference. Luke-Jr then mentioned that Eclipse and slush were already using Coinbaser, with the latter intending to use it.</p>
