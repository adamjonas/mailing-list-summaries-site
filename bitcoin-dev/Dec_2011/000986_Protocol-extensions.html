    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In 2011, Christian Decker wrote about supernodes being nodes that verify all transactions and make them available to miners. As miners become more specialized, these supernodes are likely to be owned by the miners themselves. To be a miner, one either needs to verify all the transactions they include or have someone verify them for them. Decker believes that this will result in a hierarchical network, with the miners/supernodes tightly interconnected at the top and lightweight clients at the bottom.Dr. Andy Parkins proposed a new idea to improve the decentralized system. Instead of making everyone duplicate all other work, every node would randomly choose whether to verify any particular transaction. With the assumption that the network is large and the random factor is correctly chosen, it could be ensured that every transaction is verified. Additionally, a protocol message could be added that is a negative-announce transaction, allowing nodes to tell others that they think a transaction is invalid. Miners can listen for negative announcements and use them to decide where to dedicate their verification efforts, freeing up processing power to focus on mining. This idea was previously mentioned by Parkins as a double-spend prevention method.</p>
