    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Bitcoin users on Fri, Dec 16, 2011, discussed the decentralisation feature of the cryptocurrency. They talked about the existing code and protocol for transactions to IP addresses. The proposal suggested reusing this for dynamic address lookup. Theymos proposed a few changes necessary to enable complete user at server.com handling. These include extending the protocol so that "reply" messages can be signed by a fixed public key, enabling DNS lookups for IP transactions, and standardizing the message field to put an account into it. Furthermore, they suggested using the public key for signing "reply" messages from TXT records, which will be safe with DNSSEC and Namecoin. With plain DNS, Bitcoin could take an SSH-like approach and ask the user to verify the public key the first time it is used, remembering it later. The proposal ensures that DoS attacks are handled by the IP transactions code, where the same IP address is always given the same bitcoin address until it pays to that bitcoin address. Overall, it was the first proposal regarding mapping something like user at host that made sense to the sender.</p>
