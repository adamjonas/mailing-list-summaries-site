    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on December 16, 2011, Andy Parkins argues that it is unfair to expect a user's identity to be expressed in just an email address. He suggests that there are an infinite number of variations that can be used, depending on the preference of the mapper. In contrast, he notes that there is no equivalent for someone who wants to supply their transaction (TX) to a mapping server. Rick responds by explaining that specifying a standard for look-up using HTTP(s) transport has not been done in the PATH portion of the URI; hence there is no RFC that specifies such. He mentions that various schemes have been specified, developed and deployed, including sip:// ftp:// etc://, as described on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme</a>. NAPTR records (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPTR_record)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPTR_record)</a> are another area that deserves research for those that desire URI schemes. Rick advocates for this work to be done in the standards development process and considers IBANN as one such effort.</p>
