    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jordan Mack expressed his skepticism about the feasibility of using Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for storage of blockchain, calling it difficult to impossible to guarantee against data loss or manipulation. Additionally, verification of transactions would be a challenge since one cannot necessarily trust the peers they are connected to. In response, Jeff Garzik pointed out that the blockchain data is internally self-validating, and as long as the latest block's hash is known, there is no problem downloading all other blockchain data from DHT or any other untrusted source. In a malicious case, multiple chains could be downloaded when walking hashes backward through a DHT/lookup table. However, additional factors such as DoS'ing the DHT were not considered.</p>
