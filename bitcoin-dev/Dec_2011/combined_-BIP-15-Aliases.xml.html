    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is centered around improving the Bitcoin address system. One issue raised is the vulnerability of DNS-based alias systems to spoofing, which could lead to payments being sent to the wrong party. The proposed solution involves including a bitcoin address in the identification string and using SSL communication authenticated with the respective key. This would make identification strings less useful as aliases but would provide more security. Another point of discussion was the use of base58 strings as addresses. A proposal was made to move away from this to a more flexible and human-friendly system. One suggestion was an IP transactions-like system with DNS resolution, which would give nice identifiers and shift responsibility for network acceptance to the receiver. Authentication could be achieved through SSL public-key infrastructure or bitcoin address-based authentication.To make the identifier double as a clickable URL, it was suggested to use an HTTPS web service to provide the bitcoin address to be used in a transaction. However, relying on DNSSEC for security is currently difficult, so alternatives such as SSL PKI or bitcoin address-based authentication are preferred. The email system's identifiers are only useful for user-to-user payments, and for anything somewhat more business-oriented, a clickable URL with all address information hidden from the user is preferable. URLs suffixed with a Bitcoin address for authentication, where initiating a payment results in a GET of the URL and a POST of the transaction back to that URL, would be a more reasonable solution. Bitcoin already has a code and protocol for transactions to IP addresses, which could be extended to enable complete user at server.com handling, specify an account to send BTC to, and sign reply messages with a fixed public key. DNS lookups for IP transactions could also be enabled, but this method becomes too complicated as it requires updating the IP-Transaction code and implementing the full DNS system. Firstbits isn't acceptable for anything, while using a chain specifically crafted for such a purpose isn't terrible, it doesn't scale well, and if it becomes popular, every implementation would have to rely on trusted servers. In summary, the discussion highlights various ways to improve the Bitcoin address system, including using SSL communication authenticated with the respective key, shifting responsibility for network acceptance to the receiver through an IP transactions-like system with DNS resolution and using HTTPS web service to provide the bitcoin address to be used in a transaction. However, relying on DNSSEC for security is currently difficult, so alternatives such as SSL PKI or bitcoin address-based authentication are preferred. The group also discussed the limitations of certain systems like Firstbits and suggested extending the existing code and protocol for transactions to IP addresses.</p>
