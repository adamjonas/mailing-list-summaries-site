    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around improving the security of the Bitcoin address system. One proposal involves using URI + bitcoin address pairs to prevent spoofing of DNS servers and ensure payments are made to the correct person. However, the challenge then becomes securely transmitting the URL + address to the client. Another suggestion is to move away from using base58 strings as addresses and create an IP transaction-like system with DNS resolution. These proposals can mitigate the authentication problem in the original system by trusting the existing SSL public-key infrastructure or adding bitcoin address-based authentication on top.Pieter, a developer for Bitcoin, proposed using URLs as address identifiers and suffixing them with a bitcoin address for authentication. Payment initiation to either of these URLs would result in a GET request of the URL. When a transaction is constructed, it is POSTed back to that URL. Pieter also recommended using hardcoded mapping so that shorthand could be used. Theymos suggested reusing Bitcoin's code and protocol for transactions to IP addresses, enabling complete user at server.com handling. However, Matt argued that this method is overcomplicated compared to DNS or HTTPS methods. He suggested extending the "checkorder" messages so they can specify an account to send BTC to or standardizing how to put the account into the message field. Jorge Tim√≥n brought up the idea of using Namecoin, but Matt argued that it would still require trusted servers if it becomes popular, making HTTPS/DNSSEC-based implementation a better option. Finally, Firstbits was deemed unacceptable due to scalability issues and filling the blockchain with unnecessary data.</p>
