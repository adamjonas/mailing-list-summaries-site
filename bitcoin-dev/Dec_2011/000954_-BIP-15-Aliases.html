    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Working with MIME libraries can be a challenging task as they are often found to be extremely buggy. MIME is a complicated format that has limited support, making it difficult to work with. When dealing with raw MIME encoded data, e-mail is still the most common case, which is why MIME functions still live in e-mail libraries. Despite growing beyond its intended purpose, the MIME module remains in the e-mail library.The root of the problem may lie in the undefined content length and text-based boundaries, which can cause significant issues when working with MIME. This issue has been present for years, and despite being around much longer, sufficient support for MIME in every language has not yet been achieved.</p>
