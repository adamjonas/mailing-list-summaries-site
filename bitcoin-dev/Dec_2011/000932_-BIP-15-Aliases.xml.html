    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread dated December 18, 2011, Jorge Tim√≥n proposed the integration of namecoin to map the IP address of servers for users who prefer HTTP and HTTPS over namecoin. However, the question of how to authenticate the host was raised, as CAs certificates are used in HTTPS to verify authenticity. The issue with HTTP was also highlighted due to its vulnerability. One possible solution suggested was for the remote host to sign its SSL key with the ECDSA key if the URI contains an address. Another option is to use DNSSEC/namecoin to authenticate the host. The discussion further moved onto the need for a proper protocol to negotiate payment. The proposal to integrate namecoin has sparked a conversation about the valid format of the answered message, including fields like "amount" and "concept." Overall, the discussion highlights the need for a secure and reliable payment negotiation protocol that can be trusted by all parties involved.</p>
