    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The topic of supernodes and their potential emergence is discussed in this email thread. The idea of browser-based wallets is noted as a possible way for servers to become supernodes, which would make it easier to use validation schemes. However, if Bitcoin wants to maintain a true peer-to-peer setup, a different path will need to be taken. The author notes that a new attack vector isn't particularly alarming, and that as long as 7 confirmations are required for larger transactions, there is little risk. Cheating smaller transactions would also be difficult because 8 different A.B nodes must give approval. The hash space should not be divided more finely than necessary, or else finding 8 different A.B nodes could be difficult. With the growth of clients, the hash space can be divided further. Overall, this email thread discusses various ideas surrounding the potential emergence of supernodes and ways to ensure security in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
