    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been put forth to use full public key addresses instead of hashed public keys. The reason is that using hashed public keys requires more space than a send-to-pubkey, where the output contains the pubkey, and the input the signature. Possible improvements include compressed public keys, compact signatures, and pubkey recovery. Several combinations could be proposed including send-to-pubkeys-hash, send-to-recovered-pubkeys-hash-with-compact-signature-inside-op_eval, send-to-pubkey, send-to-compressed-pubkey, and send-to-compressed-pubkeys-hash. A small table was created by Gregory Maxwell to compare these options. If pruning isn't considered, everything is better than send-to-pubkeys-hash as we have now. Pay-to-address + key recovery is quite a bit smaller than pay-to-compressed pubkey. Pay-to non-compressed pubkey is smaller than pay-to-address-without-recovery assuming you don't prune, and its more deployable because nodes can already receive it. Under no circumstances should the use of first bits ever be supported.</p>
