    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the BIP15 standard, Walter Stanish questions the proposal put forth by Andy in favor of URLs. While URI can sufficiently identify a resource, it does not explain the interaction. The BIP15 standard should set the format of the client-server conversation. Interaction is necessary, but a widely felt need to preserve anonymity through the use of temporary addresses may miss the point of aliasing schemes. Aliasing reduces anonymity, as it needs to be looked up somewhere. The point of an aliasing server is to give a single, unchanging, well-known label to a transacting party while still enabling that party to generate a new address per transaction. Generating a temporary address requires actual processing to achieve, and the issuing of the new address cannot be done without interacting with the entity hosting the wallet. The sending party loses a little anonymity because their IP is revealed when they connect to the aliasing system. But there is very little anonymity in a supplier-client relationship anyway. In summary, the discussion highlights the importance of interaction and the limits of anonymity in transacting parties.</p>
