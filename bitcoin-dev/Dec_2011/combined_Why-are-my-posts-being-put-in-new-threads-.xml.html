        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The post's author is seeking clarification on how email message threads are identified. They previously made posts intended for a specific thread, but they were placed in new threads instead. The author initially thought it was the subject line that identified the thread, but they have since learned this is not always the case.Eric Lombrozo posted in December 2011 asking which part of an email message identifies the thread. He had posted messages intended for the protocol extensions thread but found them in new threads instead. In response, a link to a webpage explaining how email threading works was provided. It explains that different email clients use different methods to determine which messages belong to a particular thread. Some use the subject line while others use the In-Reply-To or References header fields.Overall, Eric's post and subsequent response shed light on the intricacies of email threading and the importance of understanding how different email clients handle it to ensure proper communication.</p>
