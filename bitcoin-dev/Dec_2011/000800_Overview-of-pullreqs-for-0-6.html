    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post is a list of changes and merges suggested for Bitcoin. The author has listed out the changes that have been ACK'd (approved) for version 0.6, including Caps Lock detection in askpassphrasedialog, Coinbaser, Multisignature and OP_EVAL support, QR Code generation via libqrencode, and Bitcoin-Qt signmessage GUI. All of these changes are available on the author's personal 'next' branch. Additionally, the author has listed out changes that might be good for version 0.6, such as adding -keepnode to attempt to -addnode and keep a connection open, specifying fees explicitly via JSON-RPC, storing fewer time samples, compressed pubkeys, and full URL support in bitcoin-qt. These changes are available on the author's personal 'next-test' branch. The post also mentions changes that need more review and support, such as IPv6 support, multithreaded JSON-RPC with HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive support, FastGetWork optimization, SIGUSR1 new block notifications, advanced anonymity features, and Address Book related fixes. Finally, the author provides links to their personal branches where these changes can be found.</p>
