    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter Wuille proposed an alternative to OP_EVAL, called OP_CHECKEDEVAL. It is specified as follows: it looks at the two elements most recently pushed by a literal, S (the serialized script), and H (its hash). This implies it defines its own literal-only stack where all literals push to, and only OP_CHECKEDEVAL pops from. For the outer script, it does not have any effect on the main stack, alt stack or any other part of the execution state except for 2 elements popped from the literal-only stack and potentially causing failure. Failure is caused when no two elements remain on the literal-only stack, Hash(S) != H, or the inner script execution caused failure. The inner script executes in a completely new and independent execution environment and inherits the main stack and alt stack (without the serialized script and the hash themselves) from the outer execution. This requires OP_CHECKEDEVAL to immediately follow the push of script and hash so the code in the pair OP_CHECKEDEVAL > can be parsed and interpreted as code, allowing static analysis. A basic pay-to-script-hash scriptPubKey is very short: OP_CHECKEDEVAL, and it is redeemed using [script input] >. The implementation is very similar to what was already done for OP_EVAL with modifications like EvalScriptInner needing less by-ref arguments, as it cannot modify the parent's state and a literal-only stack needs to be maintained. The advantages of OP_CHECKEDEVAL are easy spend-to-script-hash (shorter than OP_EVAL), backward compatible (guaranteed by construction, instead of separately enforced like with OP_EVAL), statically analyzable (though it requires deserializing the script data), and the possibility to introduce a new language inside. The disadvantages include being slightly less flexible than OP_EVAL as it disallows dynamic interaction with serialized scripts and static code analyzers need to deserialize script data. The proposal guarantees that interpreting OP_CHECKEDEVAL as OP_NOPx can never cause the script to become invalid if it wasn't already.</p>
