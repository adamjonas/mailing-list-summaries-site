    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The OpenPGP Spec RFC2440 defines key types for EC, but it is unclear if they were ever implemented on the keyserver side. The idea of a 'web of trust' using private keys to sign people's identities similar to PGP could be applied to EC key pairs. Zell Faze suggests finding a decentralized solution to implement BIP 15 and keep Bitcoin decentralized in every aspect of the protocol. Luke-Jr agrees that an address of some form is unavoidable, but disapproves of FirstBits as it may create a gold-rush to grab addresses. HTTPS is deemed not much better than TXT records as it is only as secure as the centralized CAs. In other news, Microsoft is holding a Learn Windows Azure training event for developers on Tuesday, December 13th, which can be attended online.</p>
