    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The current version of BIP 158 includes txids, output scripts, and input prevouts in its "basic" filter. However, it is suggested that filtering for txids may not be necessary as there are few reasons why one would not be able to filter for the set of output scripts in a known transaction. Additionally, it is suggested that output scripts and input prevouts should be split out as many wallets only need to find transactions paying to them rather than transactions spending from their outputs. There are concerns regarding the size of filters and how they may make existing SPV clients less willing to adopt BIP 158 compared to the current bloom filter garbage. Further exploration into ways to split out filters to make them less bandwidth intensive is needed. Suggestions include providing filters for certain script templates such as being able to only get outputs that are segwit version X or other similar ideas.</p>
