    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the bitcoin-dev thread, Matt Corallo proposed to skip txids in the "basic" filter of BIP 158 and split output scripts and input prevouts. He believes that it is almost unnecessary to filter for txids and it would be better to filter for the set of output scripts of a transaction instead. For wallets, finding transactions paying to them is more important than finding transactions spending from their outputs. However, Peter Todd pointed out two cases where wallets need to find txs spending from their outputs: waiting for a confirmation and detecting theft. The latter case is important for wallets, but reducing the frequency of checking for stolen funds doesn't decrease total bandwidth cost. In conclusion, while filtering for the set of outputs in a transaction can be accomplished, one should consider the size of the filters themselves, not just the size of the blocks downloaded after a match.</p>
