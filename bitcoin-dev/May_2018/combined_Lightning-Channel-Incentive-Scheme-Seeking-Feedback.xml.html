        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Chenxi has been working on a proposal to incentivize lightning channels and is looking for input from others in the industry. The proposal, titled "Hey Chain.pdf," is available in PDF format for review. The purpose of the proposal is to provide incentives that encourage the use of lightning channels, which are payment channels built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. By incentivizing users to open and use these channels, the hope is that they will become more widely adopted and help to scale the network.Chenxi's proposal includes a variety of potential incentives, such as fee rebates and rewards for channel capacity. It also suggests ways to measure the success of these incentives, including tracking the number of active channels and the amount of bitcoin flowing through them.Feedback on the proposal is welcome, as Chenxi hopes to refine and improve it with input from others in the industry. Those interested in reviewing the proposal can do so by accessing the attached PDF file.</p>
