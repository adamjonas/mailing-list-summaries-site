    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Matt Corallo suggests that the txids filter in BIP 158 could be skipped entirely as there is almost no reason why one would not be able to filter for output scripts in a transaction they know about. He also suggests that input prevouts and output scripts may want to be split out so that wallets can find transactions paying to them rather than spending from their outputs. Corallo believes that there are two cases where wallets want to find transactions spending from their outputs: waiting for a confirmation and detecting theft. The former can be turned off once there are no expected unconfirmed transactions, while reducing the frequency of checking for stolen funds does not decrease the total bandwidth cost. However, real-world bandwidth cost can be reduced by waiting for a wifi connection rather than using cellular data.</p>
