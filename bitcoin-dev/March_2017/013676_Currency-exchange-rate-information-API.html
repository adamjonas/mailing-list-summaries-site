    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev discussion, members talked about the need for authentication when manipulating exchange rates and using HTTPS to ensure that. For displaying historical transactions, the market rate at the time of payment is more useful than the current market rate. However, there is no query that tells the server to give the value closest to timestamp t or similar. The client can download and keep a large part of history and extract the information on its own but not every client wants to do that, and also the client does not know in advance the bounds (from, to) that it must query. The current draft is insufficient for specifying granularity. As soon as one moves away from timestamps to something like hours or days, all kinds of issues with timezone, daylight saving time etc. appear. Pushing is what longpolling does.</p>
