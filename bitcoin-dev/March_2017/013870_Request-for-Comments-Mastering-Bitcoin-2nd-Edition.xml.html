    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas Antonopoulos, author of "Mastering Bitcoin", is requesting feedback and corrections for the second edition of his book. Although this may be considered off-topic, he believes it is relevant as the book is often the first source of information for many new bitcoin developers. The book is in pre-production and will be published within the next 6-8 weeks. The new edition covers several new topics, including segwit, bip9 signalling, timelocks, payment channels, and lightning network. Additionally, most chapters have undergone significant changes, clarifications, and corrections. The book is open source (CC-BY-SA) and can be found on GitHub. Antonopoulos welcomes pull requests, issues, and comments, but there are only 2-3 weeks left before it goes into a production freeze.</p>
