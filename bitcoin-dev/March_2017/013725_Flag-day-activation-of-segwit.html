    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Shaolinfry proposed mandatory SegWit activation between October 1st and November 15th of 2017. However, developer Luke Dashjr stated that this proposal was not actually BIP 9 compatible and suggested that the bit loses its meaning after activation and should not be set. The default behavior of BIP 9 in Bitcoin Core is to signal through the LOCKED_IN period, and it would be easy to add a condition to not require mandatory signaling during LOCKED_IN. Additionally, Dashjr noted that a 5% tolerance did not make sense since miners would already have plenty of warning about the upcoming mandatory signaling period. He ultimately chose to present the simplest option first and had no strong feelings either way on both counts.</p>
