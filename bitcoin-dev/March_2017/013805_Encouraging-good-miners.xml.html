    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to add a preference for mined blocks with more transactions, which would come into play when two blocks of the same height are found. This would ensure that the first good block mined is not orphaned if it had fewer transactions than another block. It is also suggested that this rule apply to the current and previous blocks as well. The proposal would increase incentives for full blocks, making it less of an assumption that smaller blocks will win rewards. Although this makes it more difficult for miners to attack a chain by mining small or empty blocks, there are still many ways in which a chain can be attacked. The email containing this proposal was sent using ProtonMail, a secure email service.</p>
