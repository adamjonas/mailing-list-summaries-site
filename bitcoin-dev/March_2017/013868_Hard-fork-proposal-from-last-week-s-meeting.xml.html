    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The controversial nature of SegWit's increase from 1 mb size limit to 4 mb weight limit has led some users to demand further size increases. However, the author believes that this is not a satisfactory solution, as it only provides a one-time increase with no future plans. Instead, the blocksize debate and problem need to be continuously discussed. The author suggests changing the tone of the discussion, as both sides of the argument resort to extreme viewpoints and conspiracy theories to interpret the actions of Core or BU. The author argues that both factions need to accept that microtransactions from all humans cannot go on-chain, and that never increasing the blocksize doesn't mean millions of home users will run nodes. In response to SegWit's controversy, Jorge Timon suggests talking to users to see how they think SegWit harms them. He also proposes having an uncontroversial hardfork as soon as possible, such as fixing the timewarp attack. Bram Cohen warns against the assumption that an idea can be agreed upon later when it cannot be agreed upon now. Trying to put a time limit on it runs into the possibility that the reasons for not agreeing on a new setup before still apply.</p>
