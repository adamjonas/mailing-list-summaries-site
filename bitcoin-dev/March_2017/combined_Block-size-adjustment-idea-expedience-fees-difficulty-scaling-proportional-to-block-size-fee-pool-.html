        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On March 30, 2017, a proposal was made to alter the difficulty scaling of block size in Bitcoin. The proposal suggested that larger blocks would mean greater difficulty, but it doesn't scale linearly. This means miners can take a penalty in difficulty to claim more high fee transactions in the same amount of time, effectively increasing their profits. However, when such profitable fees are not available, they have to reduce block size. Users pay miners to increase block size or do not pay, which reduces it.One solution to this issue would be getting a fee pool through softfork code instead of hardfork code to simplify the process. The percentage of the fees that miners get to claim vs what they have to donate to the pool based on the size of the block they generated could be altered instead of altering difficulty calculation. Larger blocks mean smaller percentages of fees. This is another way to pay for blocksize. On average, miners that generate smaller blocks take a share of what otherwise would be part of the mining profits of those generating larger blocks. Adjustments would need to be made according to usage, as the closer you are to the expected blocksize, the more you keep.Another proposal that was softfork compatible was made for a fee pool to prevent miners from publishing their own "out of band fee" address and collecting all the fees directly. Additionally, a proposal suggested adding a second fee type involving a specially labeled anyone-can-spend output with a defined "best-before" block number and a function describing the decline of the fee value for every future block. However, it was pointed out that OP_RETURN wouldn't work in this scenario and a new signature-check opcode would be required.Luke Dashjr expressed skepticism towards a proposal that suggested miners could potentially delay some transactions with lower fees in order to include them in the next block. He argued that miners always mine as if it's their only chance to get the fee, because if they don't, another miner will. Dashjr proposed that with correctly configured incentives, making it more profitable to delay certain transactions with lower fees and including them in the next block would smooth out transaction inclusion. Additionally, Dashjr noted that the fee pool does counteract the idea of delaying transactions with lower fees, as miners will still receive a share via the pool when there are fewer transactions available the next time they create a block, similar to insurance.Overall, the email thread discusses the idea of block size dependent difficulty scaling and how a hardfork might be required. The larger the block size, the greater the difficulty, but not in a linear fashion. Miners can take a penalty in difficulty to claim a greater number of high fee transactions in the same amount of time, which increases their profits. Users pay miners to increase block size, but when profitable fees aren’t available, they have to reduce block size. A fee pool could simplify this process, with less hardfork code and more softfork code. The expected block size calculation needs to be adjusted according to usage. Combining Expedience fees with Block size dependent difficulty scaling could make it even more effective.</p>
