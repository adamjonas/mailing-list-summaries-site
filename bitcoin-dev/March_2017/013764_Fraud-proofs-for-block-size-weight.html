    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr has presented a draft BIP for fraud proofs and how light clients can detect blockchains that are simply invalid due to excess size and/or weight. This specific attack can be proven, and reliably so, since the proof cannot be broken without also breaking their attempted hardfork at the same time. This is necessary to establish that the claimed block transaction count is correct. The proposed system would allow light clients to verify that a full node they're connected to is not lying to them about the state of the network or the validity of transactions. The draft BIP for fraud proofs includes the creation of proofs, proof verification, proof format, network protocol, rationale, and more. Some questions have been raised regarding the draft BIP, such as whether it requires information to be added to blocks or if it can work on the existing format, does it count the number of transactions or their total length, and does it allow for proofs of length in the positive direction demonstrating that a block is good.</p>
