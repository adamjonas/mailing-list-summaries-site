    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>AJ West, the creator of Preferred Miner, a proof-of-concept project that examines "miners as service providers," believes certain miners will become preferred by users. Users want to support miners who signal for the features they care about, including political positions, consensus ideology, and physical location. West proposes two solutions: creating segregated mempools that give authenticated third parties like Preferred Miner access to pending transactions destined for specific sets of miners or creating transactions with mining fees directed to an address owned by preferred miners. Both methods have pitfalls, including trusting multiple parties' interests, paying extra fees to offset risk, and maintaining a directory of mining pools' receiving addresses for outputs. West hopes the Bitcoin developer community can create deeper-level solutions, such as regulated block space or regulated consensus space.</p>
