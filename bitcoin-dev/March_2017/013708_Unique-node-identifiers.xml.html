    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of BIP150 is optional. The Tor network is a centralized network, with each node having a long-term identity key and periodically proving to the authority servers that they are the owners of this key. Unfortunately, the original proposal for visible node identities on the network would reinvent this system, which can only lead to something centralized that cannot apply to the Bitcoin network. It's not advisable for Bitcoin nodes to have anything similar to long-term node IDs, as it could lead to centralization. BIP150 is seen as an extension of IP addresses, but more secure against network-level attackers. However, there are concerns about visible node identities and their impact on node count and the ease of faking them. The proposal is viewed as misguided, with verifiable identity keys seen as a cryptographic tool to keep certain attackers from bypassing restrictions already in place.</p>
