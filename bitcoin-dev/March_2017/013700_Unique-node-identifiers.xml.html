    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread between Eric Voskuil and Jonas Schnelli, Voskuil expressed his objection to BIP150's "a way for peers to ... guarantee node ownership". He argued that nodes are not supposed to be identifiable in any way. Schnelli responded by accusing Voskuil of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), and requested him to stop attacking BIP150/151 with such arguments. Voskuil was open to having a technical debate on the issue, but felt suspicious of those who demand others to stop arguing. Voskuil mentioned that he had received similar demands in the past from a notable Core dev and pointed to a lengthy thread discussing the topic for review.</p>
