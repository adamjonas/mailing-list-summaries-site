    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent bitcoin-dev email thread, Tom Zander made a demand that his patch must be included in the next release of Bitcoin Core. He emphasized that it was not just a suggestion. However, some members of the community are concerned about the lack of safeguards in his proposal. Another member, Paul Iverson, expressed his worry that larger block sizes might lead to a loss of decentralization and coordination issues for smaller blocks. Zander clarified that his proposal did not suggest producing 32MB blocks. Meanwhile, a member named Wang called for transparency regarding secret meetings happening within the community.</p>
