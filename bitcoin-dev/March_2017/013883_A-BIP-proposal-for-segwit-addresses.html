    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is contemplating whether to respond to a mail list or make a comment in a commit file. They mention the motivation behind this, which is that 58 requires mathematical operations over big numbers and most programming languages do not provide support for big numbers out of the box. The writer then questions why not make an address format that is generic for all scriptPubKeys, and discusses the potential confusion that could arise from introducing a new encoding format. However, they raise the point that if a new type of address can be encoded with bech32 in the future, a new address type may be needed anyway. In response to a previous discussion on using Base 32 for addresses, the writer argues that transmitting addresses via voice should not be a target use case, and non-English speaking users would not need to communicate addresses with English-speaking users. They also note that using non-alphanumeric characters complicates using addresses in certain contexts, such as filenames, and suggest using something like "Base 64url" or ideally Base 94 for shorter QR codes.</p>
