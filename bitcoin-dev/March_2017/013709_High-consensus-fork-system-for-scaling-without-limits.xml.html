    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal suggests allowing users to publish an Excessive Block size (EB) to signal readiness, which is the absolute upper bound and cannot be overridden by miners. The current EB is 1MB, but it can be configured in a config file as an advanced feature. Large users are encouraged to report their EBs publicly, and Core can ship a version with a default EB in line with both miner and economic majority after a 95% consensus fork. A versioning system is used to ensure that the two networks (old and new) are incompatible. It would be in the best interest of major exchanges and users to publicly announce their EBs so miners can have a more reliable signal to go on. Scaling includes more than just block size, and the primary idea is to remove political issues from affecting core developers. Fees are inherently political because they create barriers for low-net-worth individuals transacting using this technology. If a small business in Africa cannot afford to set up a full node due to high fees, it affects participation as a hub. Miners and users should be free to wrangle each other over fees without developer involvement. If the EB of a new node is set to be smaller than the current block size, it is only used for signal unless a fork occurs that results in a reduction active.</p>
