    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The generalised case of fraud proofs being impossible has been challenged by recent proposals of miners using oversized blocks to force a hardfork. This specific attack can be proven as the proof cannot be broken without also breaking their attempted hardfork. However, not all bitcoin holders use their own full node for validation leaving them vulnerable to such attacks. To address this, a draft BIP has been written that proposes fraud proofs and how light clients can detect invalid blockchains due to excess size and/or weight. The author believes that the draft is ready for implementation but welcomes suggestions for improvement. The draft BIP can be found on GitHub.</p>
