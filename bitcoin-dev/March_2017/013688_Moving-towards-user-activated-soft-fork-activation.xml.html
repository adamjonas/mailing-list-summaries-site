    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Gareth Williams raised concerns over hashpower activated soft forks to censor transactions in response to user activated soft forks (UASF) that the majority of hashpower disagrees with. However, Tom Zander clarified that Edmund did not suggest censoring of transactions but rather changing the form they take. Zander believes that the idea that a set of users can force miners to do something is silly and a minority miner fraction forcing the majority to do something is equally silly. He also noted that if a hash-minority attacks the hash-majority, it would be an attack on Bitcoin as a whole. Zander supports responding to such attacks with a proof-of-work hard fork that would result in two chains, allowing the market to decide which one "wins." Zander believes that Bitcoin only works when the majority of hashpower and the economic majority of users are balanced in power and have their goals aligned.</p>
