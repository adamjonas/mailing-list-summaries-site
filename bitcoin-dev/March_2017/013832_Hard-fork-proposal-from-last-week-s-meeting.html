    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread to bitcoin-dev, Paul Iverson argued that Core should not have the authority to decide on hard forks and instead it should be left to the users. Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, responded by stating that neither Core nor any other software maintainers can decide on a hard fork. Even if hard-forking changes were included in a new release, it is ultimately up to the community to choose whether to run the new software. The choice for what network rules to implement must come from node operators, not developers. Wuille emphasized that Core is not special, but rather one of many pieces of software that implement today's Bitcoin consensus rules. If a hard fork is to take place in a way that does not result in two currencies, it must be clear that the entire ecosystem will adopt it. Bitcoin Core will not merge any consensus changes that do not clearly satisfy that criterion.</p>
