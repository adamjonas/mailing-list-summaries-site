        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Testnet has experienced issues with backward compatibility between nodes running versions 0.12.x and those running 0.13.0 or higher. The problem arises because the newer versions require Segregated Witness (SegWit) functionality, which is not available in the older versions. This causes blocks received from 0.12.x nodes to be rejected by 0.13.0+ nodes without notice to the node owner. Some miners using 0.13.0+ mining blocks may also experience poor propagation, leading to chain splits and reorgs as other miners find blocks for the same height before receiving a block themselves.There have been reports of reorganizations in the Bitcoin testnet, with forks being created by multiple users mining different blocks on each chain. Investigations have revealed that the issue occurs with nodes running version 0.12, which may have longer or different chains than those running newer versions such as 0.13. The problem lies in the communication between the different versions, and newer blocks are not being propagated to older nodes, while older blocks are being propagated without issues. This indicates a backward compatibility issue, which can be replicated by forcing a node to exclusively use peers running 0.12 or older versions.In March 2017, a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the issue of backward compatibility between Bitcoin Core versions 0.13.X+ and older versions. The problem was that when nodes running version 0.12.+ tried to propagate blocks to newer nodes, those blocks were not being propagated to peers with newer versions while these newer blocks were being propagated to peers with older versions with no issues. Pieter Wuille, in response, pointed out that this behavior was expected as nodes with SegWit active only download blocks from other SegWit peers, as old peers cannot provide the witness data they need to verify the blocks.There have been some reorganizations in the Bitcoin testnet, which are not related to network issues. Bitcoin explorers such as blocktrail.com or blockr.io were following different chains at different heights, leading to the belief that there is a backward compatibility issue between 0.13.X+ and older versions. The issue can be replicated by forcing the latest version of bitcoind to exclusively use one or more peers of versions 0.12.X and older, resulting in the latest version node never receiving a new block.While there is no evidence of malicious exploitation of this issue, it is important for node owners running 0.13 or higher to be aware of the potential for isolation by 0.12 peers. Alternative Bitcoin implementations may act as bridges between the two versions and facilitate chain reorgs. It should be noted that miners using 0.13.0+ will produce blocks that propagate well, because 0.12.x- nodes will accept those blocks, and so will 0.13.0+. Furthermore, Core 0.13.0+ will use its outbound connections to connect to SegWit-enabled peers so that it will be relaying SegWit blocks to someone.</p>
