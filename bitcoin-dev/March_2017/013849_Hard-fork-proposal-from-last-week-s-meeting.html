    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo expressed concern that a hard fork would not be a simple relaxation of the block size. He suggested that historical transaction growth could be used to alleviate this problem, but that the resulting number would be super low and already provided by SegWit. Instead, he proposed focusing on designing a hard fork with a very large block size increase (closer to 4/6MB at the next halving) and the intention to soft fork it back down if miner profits are suffering. In response, Wang Chun shared a proposal he made last year in Hong Kong Consensus to code a patch to remove the block size limit of 1MB but not activate it until spring 2020, limiting the block size to 32MiB which is the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows. This patch would become part of Bitcoin Core's next release and allow third party services, libraries, wallets, and exchanges enough time to prepare for the scheduled fork. With this patch, all hard fork proposals become soft forks, and there would be enough time to discuss and decide which one to go with.</p>
