    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Wang Chun suggested a hard fork approach that was proposed last year at the Hong Kong Consensus meeting but immediately rejected by coredevs. The proposal suggests coding a patch right now to remove the 1MB block size limit while not activating it until spring 2020. The patch would be in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin would work as before with no fork occurring until spring 2020. With this patch in place, third party services, libraries, wallets, and exchanges will have enough time to prepare for the fork over the next three years. The proposal suggests limiting the block size to 32MiB which is the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows. This patch will make all previous hard fork proposals like BIP100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 148, 248, BU, etc., soft forks. If we choose to fork to only 2MB since 32MiB is already scheduled, reducing it from 32MiB to 2MB will be a soft fork. Any final decision would be a soft fork to this already deployed release. The proposal also suggests waiting until SegWit activates to truly measure the effects on the network from this increased capacity before committing to any additional increases.</p>
