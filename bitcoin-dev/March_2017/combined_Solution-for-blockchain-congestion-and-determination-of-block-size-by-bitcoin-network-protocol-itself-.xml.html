        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context provided is a discussion about block size increase proposals in Bitcoin. It has been suggested that a FAQ should be created to address concerns over the various proposals, dating back to Bitcoin Classic, which have similar issues and repeating them with minor adjustments is not productive. A member of the Bitcoin community has asked whether a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) should be submitted to address concerns over spamming the network, block sizes, and release schedule/consensus levels.The current maximum size of a block in the bitcoin protocol is 1mb, leading to a "fee market" where high transaction fees are necessary for easy use of bitcoin. This creates difficulties for merchants and new users who are unaware of the developments in the bitcoin community. The limit of 1mb creates only a finite number of transactions to get confirmed, creating a backlog of transactions that can lead to blockchain congestion. A unique solution is to let the bitcoin network change the maximum block size as per the prevailing network conditions, which would be achieved by tracking the volume of the total size of transactions done between two consecutive network difficulty changes and dividing it by 2016.A proposal similar to one by the recipient of this message, Washington Sanchez, is mentioned in a communication from David Vorick via the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Vorick asks for clarification on the purpose of the block size limit in order to have a productive discussion regarding the proposal. The link provided leads to the text of Sanchez's BIP 107. Responding to the query, another member noted that there was no quadratic hashing solution to these problems, and suggested the proposal would be similar to BIP107, which is already in place. However, there were no further details about when such a proposal might be released or what consensus levels it would need to reach.To avoid orphaning of blocks and very small blocks, a minimum block size should also be taken into effect, which should be in the range of 30-60% of the maximum block size. By implementing these preemptive measures, the bitcoin blockchain can become uncongested and provide enough space for transactions to get included in blocks easily. In conclusion, while there are resources available to help with writing and submitting a BIP, careful consideration should be given to the potential impact of the proposed change. Understanding the purpose of the block size limit is important to have a productive discussion regarding any proposal.</p>
