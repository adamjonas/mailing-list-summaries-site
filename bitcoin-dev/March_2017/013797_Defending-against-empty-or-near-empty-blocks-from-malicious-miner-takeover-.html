    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Bryan Bishop and Peter R discussed the possibility of a hash power minority not upgrading and producing a minority branch. Peter R suggested that with a tightening of the rule set, any invalid blocks produced by the minority would be orphaned, serving as a wake-up call to upgrade. However, Bishop refuted Peter's claim, stating that with bip9-based soft-fork-based activation of segwit, miner blocks will not be orphaned unless they are intentionally segwit-invalid. Bishop explained that miners automatically check every transaction seen to see if it might be valid with their own outputs substituted.</p>
