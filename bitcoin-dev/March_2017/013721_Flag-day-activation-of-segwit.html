    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the mandatory activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) on the Bitcoin network between October 1st, 2017 and November 15th, 2017. The code presented in the email includes a check for the presence of SegWit signaling in blocks that are being relayed, with a return statement triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the block does not signal for SegWit. A concern was raised about the compatibility of this code with BIP 9, which dictates that once a bit is activated, it should not be set again. To address this concern, the code should check whether the SegWit bit has already locked in before checking for its presence in relayed blocks. Finally, a time condition is included in the code to ensure that the SegWit activation period has passed.</p>
