        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin scaling debate has become increasingly politicized, with one side advocating for increasing block size through segwit and the other through a hard fork. This has resulted in many companies being hesitant to publicly take sides due to potential backlash. Pseudonymous submissions are not entirely rejected, but it is suggested that they should be carried by a well-known member of the Bitcoin community to ensure credibility. BIPs are also seen as politically based on their usefulness to each side rather than who suggests them.Protocol changes cannot be made until after a protocol upgrade has been implemented. To avoid such politicization in the future, Chris Stewart proposes a pseudonymous BIP system where authors must submit their proposals under a pseudonym. This would allow proposals to be examined based solely on their technical merits, rather than who submitted them. If an author wants credit for their proposal after it is accepted, they can reveal the preimage of the author hash to prove their identity. The goal is to maintain principled money and level the playing field by vetting claims from authority figures.The importance of anonymity for developers is also discussed. A safe space for merit is recommended to encourage contributions without fear of being a recognizable target. Privacy concerns with using personal accounts on GitHub are raised, and a decentralized version control system is suggested that would let users create a crypto key, propose BIPs anonymously, and get paid in crypto for the best commits.The conversation also touches upon making decisions based on merit versus financial gain. It is suggested that ROI currently takes precedence over merit, and there is a call for a way to finance development that provides real financial incentives for merit. Additionally, demurrage and increasing the money supply are believed to have more merit but are less discussed due to lack of profitability for existing Bitcoin investors.In summary, the ongoing Bitcoin scaling debate has led to politicization of protocol-level changes, causing hindrance in technical progress. To tackle this issue, Chris Stewart proposed a pseudonymous BIP system where authors must submit under a pseudonym. The importance of anonymity in online spaces, particularly within the cryptocurrency community, is also emphasized. Additionally, the conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests the development of a decentralized version control system using Mercurial, BitTorrent, and pynode with crowdfunding being suggested to support its development.</p>
