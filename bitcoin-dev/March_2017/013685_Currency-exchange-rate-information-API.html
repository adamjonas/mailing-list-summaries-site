    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of a line-feed format for separating multiple results in JSON is argued to be a premature optimization at the cost of interoperability, and it is suggested that if JSON is used, it should be used properly. Clients should word-wrap long lines, and JSON escapes newlines as "\n" which can be used doubly ("\n\n") for paragraph breaks. A draft of a BIP has been created to standardize a common format for fiat currency information in Bitcoin Knots so that wallets or other software and exchange rate providers can simply interoperate without a lot of overhead reimplementing the same thing many ways. The current draft requires using XBT (as BTC) for Bitcoin amounts, but it would seem nicer to use satoshis, although those don't really have a pseudo-ISO currency code to fit in nicely. A link to the current draft is provided.</p>
