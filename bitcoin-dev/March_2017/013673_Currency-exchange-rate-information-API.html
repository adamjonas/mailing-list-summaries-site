    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) can reduce workload during implementation on both sides of the API and allows for more data to be shown to users without implementing tons of proprietary APIs. Although not Bitcoin-specific, a BIP is seen as the right way for this. Long polling is useful for Bitcoin, as rates can change significantly in a short period of time. However, there is a concern that a public API will quickly fill up the maximum allowed httpd connections. The historical rate is necessary when displaying historical transactions, but its usefulness is questionable. Users may not be looking to restore from a seed and get all exchange rates during the time of payment. It is optional and can be implemented if desired. A client should be allowed to decide on which time scale the data should be displayed (tick, min, hour, day, etc.) along with clearly defining the type field, similar to a candle-stick chart. Pushing may be more appropriate for "current" rates than polling, but this adds complexity in other places such as state. Long-polling is seen as the real push and would require a complex server setup that complicates many things like load-balancer, mem-caching, etc.</p>
