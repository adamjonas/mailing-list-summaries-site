    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discussion between Bryan Bishop and Peter R concerning the activation of segwit states that a miner running pre-segwit code will produce blocks that no segwit node will ever receive. It is irrelevant whether these blocks contain transactions that are invalidated by the soft fork. Despite being valid to other pre-segwit nodes, they will never be built upon by the majority hash power once segwit activates. Peter's comment about a tightening of the rule set resulting in invalid blocks being orphaned, therefore serving as a wake-up call to upgrade, is incorrect. Miner blocks will not be orphaned unless intentionally segwit-invalid. A minority branch is a set of blocks that have been orphaned.</p>
