    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the possibility of a hash-minority attacking a hash-majority in Bitcoin. While some argue that it is impossible for non-mining users to attack miners, others believe that it is possible as they can refuse to buy their coinbase transaction. The majority of hash rate can choose to continue with old rules or not, and users are free to follow tighter rules than before or reject them. The disagreement can be resolved peacefully through unilateral separation. However, some believe that if the majority of the users are hostile and reject blocks that miners create, then what the miners bring to the table is also removed. Bitcoin works when the majority of the hashpower and the (economic) majority of users are balanced in power and have their goals aligned. A hash-minority attacking the hash-majority is an attack upon Bitcoin as a whole. If this were possible, it would open up the possibility of governments trying to push through changes in the same way.</p>
