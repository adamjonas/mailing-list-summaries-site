    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the cost and feasibility of running a full node for Bitcoin. One participant argues that it is a mistake to assume that others will run full nodes to protect someone else's business, unless it is proven that the nodes are decentralized and independent. They suggest that running a full node is trivial and not expensive for those who know how to do it, even with larger blocks, as long as the nodes remain decentralized. The same participant has posted a small proposal before which describes the current situation where miners are also nodes. They express concern that despite terabytes of BIPs and papers, the supposed decentralized system is biased by centralization. Another participant argues that keeping block sizes small has significant costs and that comparing the cost of running a node under arbitrary conditions is a bad way to think about the actual costs. They suggest that modern hardware with above-average bandwidth caps is necessary to justify running a node, and if node operational costs rise to a point where users cannot justify running a node, this is an important consideration. The primary reason some individuals are reluctant to join the full node club is due to storage limitations. Links to Zcash and Bitcoin wallets made simple, a dynamic blocklist, a 10 M passwords list, anti-spies and private torrents, Peersm, torrent-live, and node-Tor are included.</p>
