    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Multiple data centers are crucial for redundancy and resiliency, as well as for minimizing latency. Although physical hardware is important, data center space, business grade communication lines, and staff are much more expensive. The idea that Bitcoin should not aim towards handling 4GB blocks because we can't handle them today is reduction to absurdity and slippery slope arguments. It's important to take baby steps in the right direction. The obsession with every personal computer running a full node could lead to Bitcoin becoming obsolete. Major payment systems like PayPal, Visa, and banking systems all have multiple data centers to handle the transaction volumes they process daily. It's important for everyday users to be able to actively run full nodes to ensure Bitcoin's security. The overall quality of the discussion on this topic has been low.</p>
