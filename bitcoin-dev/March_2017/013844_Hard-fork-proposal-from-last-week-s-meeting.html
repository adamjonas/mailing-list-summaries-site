    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Wang Chun, has expressed concerns about the risks associated with hard forks and the need for proper preparation before deployment. The topic of discussion was the block size limit and the potential for repeal and replacement strategies. Some members have suggested a grace period to allow for the development and agreement on a new setup before repealing the limit, but others argue that there is no guarantee that an idea will be agreed upon later if it cannot be agreed upon now. The possibility of sticking with the status quo after much discussion and effort is a looming concern.</p>
