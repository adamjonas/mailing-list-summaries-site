    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tom Zander responded to a discussion about the authority of transaction processors (block generators) in Bitcoin on March 29, 2017. He argued that miners do not have any authority to mine or not mine certain transactions, but rather make an economic decision based on their business incentive. This distinction makes it an economical decision rather than a political one. Zander also stated that the massive distribution of miners creating blocks means that one miner is free to add his political agenda, but they can't stop other miners from mining those transactions anyway. Finally, Zander noted that the rest of the email was based on a misconception, and his argument addressed the question.</p>
