    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, participants debated whether a "hashpower activated soft fork to censor transactions" could be seen as censorship. One member argued that Bitcoin's defence against censorship and disruption is due to the broad distribution of over 50% of hash power among a large number of people. The conversation then turned to the idea that miners have no technical or ethical obligation to follow any particular set of rules. Instead, security is based on decentralisation, not well-behaved people or software. They also noted that if every person on the planet was a miner, it would be much harder to achieve consensus on any proposed material change. Regardless, the nature of sound money is that it doesn't change.</p>
