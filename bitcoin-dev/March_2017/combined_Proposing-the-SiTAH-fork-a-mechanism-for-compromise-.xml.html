        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal put forward aims to resolve the impasse between supporters of a soft-fork SegWit and those advocating for a hard-fork TX block size increase. The Soft-into-Time-Activated-Hard fork (SiTAH) is a proposed solution that involves a soft-fork locking into a predetermined hard-fork at a later point in time. This allows for a safe hard-fork without major disruption, with a transition period for all parties to upgrade their software before the hard-fork commences.Incentives are built into the SiTAH-fork proposal for both those who favor the hard-fork and those who prefer the soft-fork. Those who want the hard-fork have an incentive to support activating the soft-fork, while those who want the soft-fork have an incentive to activate the hard-fork. For implementation with SegWit, the block weight function can be replaced by a version that allows for more than 1MB of pure transaction data when the median time-past of the last 11 blocks is greater than the HardForkTime.A majority of stakeholders including developers, miners, and users are in favor of both soft-fork SegWit and a hard-fork TX block size increase, but each group favors one over the other and wants to perform their preferred fork first. There is fear that activating one will prevent the other from being activated later.Overall, the SiTAH-fork proposal offers a potential solution to the stalemate between those who favor different types of forks, providing incentives for all parties to safely activate both a soft-fork SegWit and a hard-fork TX block size increase.</p>
