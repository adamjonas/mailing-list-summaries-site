    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Juan Garavaglia and Alphonse Pace, Garavaglia expresses his disagreement with some of the conclusions in a document referred to by Pace. He argues that some estimates are not accurate and some parameters used are no longer valid for analysis today. Meanwhile, Pace suggests that the paper he referred to, which shows that even 4MB is unsafe, provides a scientific basis for opinions on block size limits. In response to Wang Chun's hard fork proposal, Pace believes that it would be better to wait until SegWit activates before committing to any additional increases. On the other hand, Chun proposes a hard fork approach, which he had previously suggested at Hong Kong Consensus last year, to remove the 1MB limit at the next block halving in spring 2020 and only limit the block size to 32MiB, the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows, and thus giving third-party services enough time to prepare for it over the next three years. However, Egs, one of the co-authors of the study, suggests that the 4MB limit mentioned in their paper should not be used as a protocol limit today due to the emergence of high-speed block relay networks and block compression.</p>
