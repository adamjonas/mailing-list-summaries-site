    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the desire to have the ability to choose where to transact in Bitcoin. The writer argues that the physical location of the miner does not have any legal implications for the relationship between sender and receiver of a payment. They explain that German law would apply to a contract between two parties in Germany, even if the payment was made in Icelandic kronur via PayPal, which went through Luxembourg, Australia, and the US. The writer also claims that almost nobody cares who will mine a transaction because it makes no technical difference. Finally, they state that if someone does not want a specific miner to mine their transaction, they do not have to use Bitcoin.</p>
