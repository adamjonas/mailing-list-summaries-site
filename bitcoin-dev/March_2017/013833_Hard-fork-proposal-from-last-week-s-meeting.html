    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Paul Iverson expressed that blocks are getting full and there is a need to increase them soon. However, he raised concerns about the proposal as it forces all node operators to accept larger blocks in 2020, which might result in a loss of decentralization. He also added that coordination for small blocks might become too difficult before it's too late. Tom Zander responded by clarifying that the suggestion was not to produce 32MB blocks, so the fear of loss of decentralization is unfounded.
