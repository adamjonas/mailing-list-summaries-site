    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been put forth by John Hardy to introduce an anonymous, opt-in, unique node identification mechanism that would help counter sybil attacks. Every node would have the opportunity to create a node 'address'/unique identifier, which could even come in the form of a Bitcoin address. The node on first installation generates and backs up a private key and the corresponding public key becomes that node's unique identifier. If the node switches to a new software version or a new IP, the identifier can remain constant if the node operator chooses. Asking a node for its identifier can be done by sending a message with the command 'identify' and a challenge. This would add a small but very useful piece of data when compiling lists of active nodes. Any register of active nodes can have a record of when a node identifier was "first seen", and how many IPs the same identifier has broadcast from. Also, crucially, we could see what software the node operator has been seen running historically.</p>
