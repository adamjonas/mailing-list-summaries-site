        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core developers have released several updates since March 2017, including versions 0.14.0, 0.14.1, and 0.14.2. These updates include a range of bug fixes and new features, such as the addition of the 'bumpfee' RPC command, which allows users to replace unconfirmed transactions with ones that pay higher fees. Other changes include improvements to transaction fee handling, the ability to purchase bitcoin directly from within the app, and fixes for vulnerabilities such as the one exploited in the WannaCry ransomware attack. Version 0.14.0 also includes performance improvements and bug fixes, with changes to the P2P protocol and network code, validation and build system updates, and the exclusion of RBF replacement transactions from fee estimation. The update also introduces assumed-valid blocks and compact blocks, manual pruning of the blockchain, and the ability to nest RPC commands in the debug console. JSON-RPC named arguments are now supported, and users can opt into RBF when sending transactions. Sensitive data is no longer stored in the debug console history, and the mempool is retained across restarts.The GUI has undergone several changes, including the ability to show HD wallet state in the status bar, show network/chain errors in the GUI, and add "Copy URI" to the payment request context menu. Wallet improvements include allowing non-wallet owned change addresses in coin control, adding a high transaction fee warning, and smarter coordination of change and fee in CreateTransaction. Changes to the tests and QA were intended to improve testing speed and efficiency, such as using a single cache directory for chains and replacing rpc_wallet_tests.cpp with python RPC unit tests. Contributors to the releases include Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. Overall, the updates include several important enhancements and bug fixes to Bitcoin Core.</p>
