    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was put forward to end the debate regarding whether or not to upgrade block size and instead implement a soft fork to a 32MB limit. It was suggested that if by 2020 the community still deemed 1MB enough, it could be changed back with another soft fork. While some agreed that planning for the future was critical, others worried about the assumption that the community would come to consensus on a future soft fork. Failure to do so could lead to a hard fork and potentially hostile miners making political demands. One person suggested a different approach- "fork-to-minimum", which would put less pressure on full nodes and the ecosystem as a whole if the maximum needed to be soft forked down. Finally, one person expressed the desire for SegWit to go live to get a better idea of how high the network pressure really is, as they believe we are currently flying blind in that regard.</p>
