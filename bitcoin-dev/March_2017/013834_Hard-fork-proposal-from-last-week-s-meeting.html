    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Tuesday, 28 March 2017, Wang Chun via bitcoin-dev proposed to code a patch to remove the block size limit of 1MB from the Bitcoin network. This proposal comes in light of approaching block capacity limits despite spam transactions on the network. The patch would limit the block size to 32MiB and not activate until the next block halving in spring 2020. According to Chun, this patch must be included in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core. However, there is no agreement yet on how to increase the block size limit. Over the past years, there have been many proposals such as BIP100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 148, and BU. All these hard fork proposals would become a soft fork with this patch already in Core's release.Tom Zander, in response to Chun's proposal, acknowledged it as a smart idea. Zander is a blogger and vlogger who shares his thoughts on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p>
