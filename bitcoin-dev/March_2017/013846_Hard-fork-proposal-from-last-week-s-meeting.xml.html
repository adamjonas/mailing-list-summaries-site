    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this message is discussing the controversy surrounding Segwit's change from a 1 mb size limit to a 4 mb weight limit. They suggest that many users who oppose Segwit may not fully understand it. Instead of discussing further size increases, the writer suggests talking to users to see how they perceive Segwit as harmful. The possibility of disinformation is also mentioned. The writer proposes having an uncontroversial hardfork, independent of block size, to fix the timewarp attack, which has less potential for controversy than other options. They caution against assuming that an idea can be agreed upon later if it cannot be agreed upon now. The riskiness of hard fork implementation is also discussed.</p>
