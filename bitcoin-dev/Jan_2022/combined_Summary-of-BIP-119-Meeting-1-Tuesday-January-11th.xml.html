        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A meeting was recently held to review BIP-119, where attendees expressed varying levels of interest and skepticism about its use cases. The focus of the review was on quadratic hashing during validation and the costs and lifetime of precomputed data caching. There were also discussions on the preferred use of SHA256 instead of RIPEMD160 for CTV and the sizes of interactive protocols without DoS.The meeting further reviewed code functionality and coverage, tests and test vectors, and discussed a bug bounty program. To conclude, there was a discussion on release timelines and activation mechanisms. Despite the fast pace of the meeting, it was pleasant, with plans to focus more heavily on applications and at a slower pace in the next session.</p>
