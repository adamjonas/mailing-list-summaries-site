    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Folkson raised the issue of there being no custom signet with CTV. Anthony Towns pointed out that there is in fact a signet with a CTV challenge, as shared by Jeremy Rubin on Twitter. However, there has only been one coinbase consolidation transaction so far and no actual CTV transactions. Rubin himself had previously mentioned having trouble producing new blocks due to issues with the IBD latch bug. He also mentioned sending funds as a manual faucet to at least one person, but noted that the lack of a readily available faucet for running a signet may have limited its use. Rubin believes that the bitcoin-faucet-shell on GitHub could be used for this purpose now. While people usually use Regtest to experiment with CTV, Rubin acknowledges the value of a signet. However, he does not see the absence of a signet with CTV as a blocking issue, but rather a nice-to-have feature.</p>
