    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Prayank shares some links with Peter regarding the use cases for Bitcoin's current restrictions, which he finds compelling. He disagrees with Peter's opinion that CTV lacks compelling use cases and technical details. Prayank explains that CTV is trying to add basic covenants in Bitcoin that would help all users and ensure that we don't end up with something contentious in the future that changes supply. He also points out the low demand for block space, which affects everyone who understands the importance of fees in the long term. Regarding the DoS attacks, Jeremy has already answered the question, and a pull request to add related information has been merged.</p>
