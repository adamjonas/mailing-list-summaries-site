    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Suredbits team, while implementing Taproot in Bitcoin, discovered a mainnet output that did not conform to the BIP 340 specification and was therefore burned. The error was made by an unknown developer rather than being a bug in the Taproot BIPs or Core implementation. The community is encouraged to share mistakes they make or things they find confusing when re-implementing Taproot or supporting it in wallets. Eliminating the key path or eliminating the script path may end up being common sources of confusion for wallets. There are existing resources available (StackExchange posts, Optech series "Preparing for Taproot", Optech workshop, etc) that could be useful for implementers. An informational BIP could be a good idea as a first port of call for Taproot implementers who find BIP 340-342 dense and difficult to parse. Libera IRC channels #bitcoin-dev and #bitcoin-core-dev are there for discussion and questions. P2TR support on the Bitcoin wiki is being tracked by Murch.</p>
