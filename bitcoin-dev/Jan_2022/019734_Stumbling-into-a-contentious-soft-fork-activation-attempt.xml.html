    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Prayank is working on a use case of OP_CTV and has announced it on Twitter. He plans to review a pull request and write contracts using Sapio based on a few ideas he has. Prayank believes that alternative proposals do not compete with OP_CTV and can all be implemented and complement each other. However, he agrees that more programming languages would be useful so that application developers can choose what works best for them.Michael Folkson expresses skepticism about OP_CTV's readiness to be activated as a consensus change and questions Prayank's claim that it should be ready in a few months. Michael believes that there are outstanding questions and zero skepticism about OP_CTV, and more work needs to be done to ensure its safety and utility. Michael encourages Prayank to attend IRC workshops on BIP 119 to get into a position where he can engage with skeptics on technical concerns. Prayank confirms that he will be attending the workshops and has dedicated enough time reading everything related to OP_CTV.There is a proposal for soft fork activation of OP_CTV with the goal of building and testing use cases post-activation. The author argues that having some use cases with code and documentation is preferable to a soft fork without any use cases. They also believe that the danger lies in a few people stopping soft forks that could improve Bitcoin due to their bias and non-technical opinions. Another individual expresses skepticism over the proposal, stating that a long list of speculated use cases means nothing on its own.While there have been soft signals from mining pools for Taproot, projects have not yet utilized it. The original author of the proposal believes that the proposal will be used by many Bitcoin projects and ultimately improve privacy, security, decentralization, and demand for block space. There is also discussion about concerns regarding rushing through the proposal after the recent Taproot activation. The second individual believes that enabling covenants on Bitcoin is a big step change with little existing research on the topic. However, the first individual argues that there is no backdoor and everything is public, and that there shouldn't be any issues with a soft fork in the next few months if it's ready.</p>
