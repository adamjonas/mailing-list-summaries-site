    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread on the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF), Steve Lee emphasized that the BLDF is not the only legal defense fund and there is room for other funds and strategies. He also disagreed with the idea that Alex or anyone should be denied the opportunity to comment on future soft forks or anything about bitcoin. Lee believes that Alex's comments should be judged on their merit, just like everyone else's. Jeremy Rubin chimed in with a question about the differences between what the BLDF can accomplish and what organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) or Berkman Cyberlaw Clinic can accomplish. While he has had positive experiences with the EFF, he wondered if the Bitcoin-specific focus of the BLDF outweighs the more general experience and track record of other organizations. However, Rubin ultimately expressed his appreciation for the BLDF and its efforts to help developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem defend themselves from lawsuits.</p>
