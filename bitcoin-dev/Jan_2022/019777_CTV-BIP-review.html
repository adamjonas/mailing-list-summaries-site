    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed his disapproval of the proposed BIP9 activation method for Taproot. He argues that this approach represents an attempt by developers to impose their will over community consensus and force a miner veto backdoor/vulnerability on deployment. Dashjr suggests that any future deployments should use BIP8 until a better solution is developed. He believes the outright deception around this topic has led to significant unnecessary conflict within the community. However, some people have criticized Dashjr's comments as misleading and aimed at leading people to believe that BIP8 was actually used. The differences between ST and BIP9 are inconsequential in this regard, and critics argue the criticism Dashjr made of BIP9 applies equally to ST.</p>
