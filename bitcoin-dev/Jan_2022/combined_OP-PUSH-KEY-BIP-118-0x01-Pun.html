        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed the addition of two new small transaction introspection opcodes, OP_PUSH_KEY_INTERNAL or OP_PUSH_KEY_EXTERNAL, which could return the taproot key for the current input. The internal key can be included in the tree already, but the external key creates a hash cycle and is not possible to include directly. These opcodes could simplify APO to use future plans for more generalized covenant, such as TLUV, which might benefit from being able to get the current key off the stack. The internal key might be useful for signing in a path not just for APO, but also because one might want to sign a transaction that is contingent on a HTLC scriptcode being satisfied.Rubin suggested that there is a small incompatibility with BIP-118 with this approach, which is that keys are not tagged for APO-enablement. Thus, there should either be a version of this opcode for APO tagged or not, or, APO should instead define some CheckSig2 which has APO if tagging is still desired.The proposal was made to create a more general approach where instead of using a single 0x01 byte as a key argument to refer to the Internal key for compactness, an opcode would actually put the Internal key on the stack. It might be worth pursuing simplifying APO to use these OP_PUSH_KEY opcodes because future plans for more generalized covenant might benefit from being able to get the current key off the stack. Pushing the external key's use is less obvious, but with the development of future opcodes, it would be helpful for some recursive covenants. Both opcodes are very design specific -- there's only one choice of what data they could push.</p>
