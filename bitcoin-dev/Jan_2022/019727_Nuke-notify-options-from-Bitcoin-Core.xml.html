    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the email conversation, Prayank is responding to Daniel about some points that he might have missed. Prayank mentions that many fancy things won't work in Windows shortcut target and it is more suspicious even if someone tries to wrap it in notify options provided by Bitcoin Core. He also highlights that this will not provide him with an option to run a command based on events like received transactions in the wallet. On the other hand, notify options provide some options that every malware is looking for. Prayank suggests that there is enough time to research more about the issue and respond with something new or helpful for documentation. The email ends with Prayank's public key.</p>
