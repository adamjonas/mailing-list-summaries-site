    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion, Bitcoin developers are considering the adoption of a new opcode called OP_CTV to allow for more flexible smart contract functionality on the blockchain. However, some developers are concerned about the combinatorial growth of flags and its implications for testing, as well as technical debt and the potential need for additional hash formats in the future. Others argue that the simplicity of OP_CTV makes it a low-risk change and that it is currently the most practical approach for vaulting. The discussion also highlights the importance of being mindful of the long-term implications of design choices made today. Additionally, the utility of vaulting is noted as underappreciated among consensus developers.</p>
