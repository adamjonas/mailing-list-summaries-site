    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, the discussion is centered around the creation of a fund that would be used to defend electronic cash. The name of the fund is being deliberated and it is suggested that a more neutral name be chosen in order to avoid confusion among new users. The fund is intended to cover more than just Bitcoin, with reference made to Satoshi's paper where everything started. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is mentioned as a potential model for the fund, even though the US is not the only target. The issue of people involved in the fund commenting or influencing soft fork related discussions is also raised. It is suggested that the board operating principles should be established, which would include criteria on how cases are chosen to prevent the board and fund from influencing direction. Finally, there is a request for information on the current procedures with the Tulip thing, although it is unclear what exactly this refers to.</p>
