    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin ecosystem is susceptible to legal pressure, especially for independent open-source developers. The newly established fund aims to defend developers from lawsuits and pay legal bills. It will primarily focus on the defense of pending litigation and new litigation that may arise. However, its ultimate goal is to build up the capacity to provide competent third-party advice to developers on strategies to reduce their liability. Rene Pickhardt asked if the fund would also help educate developers about risks they face and measures to reduce them to avoid legal pressure in the first place. While the main purpose of the fund is to defend developers, it remains to be seen if it will expand its services to include education.</p>
