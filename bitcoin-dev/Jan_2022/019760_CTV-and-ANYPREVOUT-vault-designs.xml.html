    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>This email discusses the current lack of research on the safety and utility of different ways to construct vault designs. The covenant opcode TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY proposed in September 2021 has yet to be implemented, making it difficult to compare to constructing vaults using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT or OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. However, the TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY enables a vault design that matches a previous design by Bryan Bishop with additional benefits. Jeremy Rubin initially described OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY (which became OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) as a "rudimentary, limited form of covenant which does not bear the same technical and social risks of prior covenant designs." Andrew Poelstra has blogged on how to use OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK to construct covenants and vaults. These would enable more generalized covenants than OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, but with the downsides of being less efficient and arguably riskier.The solitary paper that has compared building vaults using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT at the time of writing is Bitcoin Covenants: Three Ways to Control the Future. This paper discussed three categories of vault design - deleted key, recovered key, and script-based covenants. Recovered-key and script-based covenants are mostly functionally equivalent, and if either were enabled, a new domain of practical covenant-based protocols could emerge.The paper concluded by stating that every modification of bitcoin's code-base and protocol introduces systemic risks, and it is difficult to analyze those risks. It would be hubris to claim that there are no unknown risks being introduced.</p>
