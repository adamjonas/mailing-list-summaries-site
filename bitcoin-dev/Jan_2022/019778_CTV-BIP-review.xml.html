    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 18th, 2022, Eric at voskuil.org wrote that the only material difference between BIP9 and BIP8 is that the latter may activate without signaled support of hash power enforcement. Soft forks are not backward compatible and can cause a chain split if unenforced, however, enforcement of the Bitcoin consensus protocol is by users, not miners. Although miners can cause disruption in retaliation, soft forks themselves do not produce a chain split. Despite achieving consensus for Taproot activation, BIP8 never gained sufficient support due to the potential for chain splits caused by unenforced soft forks. Furthermore, the statement claiming that BIP8 was not used to activate Taproot is misleading, as it was used with some technical tweaks to BIP9. The deception around this topic has led to significant unnecessary conflict in the community, and it is essential to make honest arguments instead of attempting to deceive.</p>
