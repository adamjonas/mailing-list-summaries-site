    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A meeting was held regarding the BIP-119, with attendees expressing varying levels of interest and skepticism about its use cases. The review of the BIP focused on quadratic hashing during validation and the costs and lifetime of precomputed data caching. It was preferred that CTV use SHA256 instead of RIPEMD160 and there was discussion about the sizes of interactive protocols without DoS. The meeting also reviewed code functionality and coverage, tests and test vectors, and discussed a bug bounty program. The meeting concluded with a discussion on release timelines and activation mechanisms. Overall, the meeting was fast-paced but pleasant, with the next session to focus more heavily on applications and at a slower pace.</p>
