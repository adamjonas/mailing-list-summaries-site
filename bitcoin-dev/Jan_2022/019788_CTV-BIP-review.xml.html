    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jeremy Rubin responded to a proposal for BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) for specific use cases for CTV (CheckTemplateVerify), expressing skepticism about that approach and instead viewing BIPs primarily for standardization. In response, Alex suggested having explicit application notes that provide details on how CTV can be used in specific applications, while still making it clear that they are not part of CTV itself. The analogy was made to electronic components, which have both a data sheet (formal documentation) and application notes (specific details on how to use the component in a particular application). Luke Dashjr provided a detailed review of the CTV BIP, expressing concern about its readiness and stating that BIP 9 should not be used due to known flaws and vulnerabilities. He also questioned some of the claims made in the BIP and suggested alternative approaches for certain use cases.</p>
