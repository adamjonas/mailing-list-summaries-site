    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Christian Decker responded to a message from Prayank regarding BIP 118 (SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT) and its readiness for activation. Decker explained that the lack of discussion around activation in BIP 118 was intentional, as they wanted to allow for bundling with other soft-forks and minimize potential conflicts. He also noted that APO is not significantly more complex than the original proposal of SIGHASH_NOINPUT and that Richard Myers has implemented a proof-of-concept of eltoo on top of experimental branches of APO. Decker considers APO and OP_CTV proposals complementary, and states that he is happy to go with either one if only one gets activated. Finally, Decker clarifies that APO is sufficient to get eltoo and that extensions, such as layered commitments, can be added at a later stage.</p>
