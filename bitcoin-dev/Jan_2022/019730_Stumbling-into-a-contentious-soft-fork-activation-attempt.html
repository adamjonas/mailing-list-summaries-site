    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian, a co-author of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 118, has responded to a claim that the proposal is not ready for implementation. BIP 118, also known as SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, is exploring the use case of eltoo payment channels and is being developed by its contributors without any imminent activation attempt. The author pointed out that BIP 118 was originally called "sighash_noinput" and was mentioned in 2015 when Joseph and Tadje wrote about its applications in the Lightning Network (LN) protocol. It was later adapted to integrate with Taproot and renamed to anyprevout. The author clarified that the reason why neither noinput nor APO have a section on activation is that they want to allow bundling with other soft-forks and minimize the surface for potential conflicts. Review capacity is limited, and developer time expensive. The author believes that most developers are aware of the many improvements anyprevout would enable, so there is little point in constantly talking about it. The people interested in exploring this venue are already working on it, and they just need to wait for an opportune moment to start the activation discussion with other soft-forks.Lastly, the author addressed OP_CTV, which is being compared to APO. While it seems possible to emulate APO using OP_CTV, APO does not have any overhead in the transaction size, which is not the case for OP_CTV. The author considers the two proposals complementary, and not competing.</p>
