    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the readiness of OP_CTV, a proposed consensus change in Bitcoin, has sparked controversy among developers. While some individuals believe it is ready to go in a few months, others argue that there hasn't been enough review and testing to support such claims. Skeptics are calling for a higher bar on readiness for consensus changes, and they encourage proponents of OP_CTV to explore alternative proposals and thoroughly examine its use cases before attempting an activation. Meanwhile, the authors and contributors of another soft fork proposal, BIP 118, are building out and testing one of the speculated use cases, eltoo payment channels. As for OP_CTV, there are concerns that an attempted activation could be contentious and potentially damaging to the entire ecosystem. The priority should be to avoid rushing through a change without sufficient research and community support.</p>
