    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on implementing a CTV opcode, James O'Beirne explains that caching for something like TXHASH is different from CTV as it has a single kind of hash. He doesn't see caching as a particular problem even for the various flags Russell described. O'Beirne suggests that if they were to adopt something like TXHASH, they'd have to decide which mechanism was better, what algorithm would be used and how it should be parametrized, and what an appropriate upgrade path for the mechanism would be. Even with BIP 119 providing some answers, they still need to do work to determine if it's a good answer. Though it might take a while to get a good answer, they could rush ahead with more of a "well, we're pretty sure it's not going to be a disaster" attitude with TXHASH almost as easily as with CTV. O'Beirne notes that the utility of vaulting seems underappreciated among consensus devs and it's something he'd like to write about soon in a separate post. He thinks most of the opposition to CTV is just that support seems to be taking the form of "something must be done; this is something, therefore it must be done." He'd be more comfortable if the support looked more like a comparison of alternatives to CTV, including advantages and drawbacks for each, how they interact with other ideas, and why one approach is the best. However, mostly the alternatives are dismissed with "this will take too long" or "this enables recursive covenants which someone (we don't know who) might oppose".</p>
