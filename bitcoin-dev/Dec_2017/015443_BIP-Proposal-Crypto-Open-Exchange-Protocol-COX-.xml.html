    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The current currencyCode and cryptoCurrencyCode system assumes that merchants will always want to sell for fiat, but some may prefer another cryptocurrency instead. To address this, a suggestion has been made to make the system more generic by using buySymbol and sellSymbol instead. For example, instead of using "currencyCode" : "CAD" and "cryptoCurrencyCode" : "BTC", merchants could use "buySymbol" : "CAD" and "sellSymbol" : "BTC" to indicate their preferred method of payment. This would give merchants more flexibility in their transactions and allow them to choose the payment method that works best for them. By implementing this change, merchants would be able to easily switch between different cryptocurrencies without having to worry about the limitations of the current system. This would also help to promote the use of different cryptocurrencies as more merchants would be willing to accept them as payment. Overall, making the system more generic would benefit both merchants and customers by providing greater choice and flexibility in transactions.</p>
