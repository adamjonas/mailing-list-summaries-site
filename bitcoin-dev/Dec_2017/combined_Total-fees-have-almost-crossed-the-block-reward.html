        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin's rising transaction fees have caused some concern among users, but experts see it as a sign of success and a long-desired fee market. However, there is concern that the high fees per transaction may be too prohibitive for certain use cases, particularly at this point in the adoption curve, with segwit adoption standing around 10%. Efforts are being made to encourage efficient use of block space by batching transactions and implementing segwit. The mempool shows congestion at a peak, but it may come down over the long weekend. Additionally, some evidence suggests that a portion of the current high rate congestion is contrived traffic. In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Mark Friedenbach stated that every transaction is already replace-by-fee capable, and opt-in replace by fee is a fiction that was only relevant when fees were smaller than subsidy. There are also concerns regarding the long-term security of Bitcoin once the reward goes away and fees replace it. Meanwhile, Melvin Carvalho expressed concern about the blockchain's long-term security and suggested looking at difficult-to-forge market signals rather than just claims, with more education required to ensure that market signals are efficient. Melvin Carvalho shared data points on the state of Bitcoin, with fees becoming prohibitive for some use cases, segwit adoption standing at around 10%, and mempool congestion at a peak. Ryan suggested more progressive fee approaches, while Christian Decker and Peter Todd discussed how shabang.io determines whether or not a transaction funded a Lightning channel.The long-term security of the blockchain is a concern as the block reward reduces and fees replace it. Currently, fees make up 45% of the block reward with potential to reach 50%. There is concern that the fee per transaction may be too high for some use cases, particularly as segwit adoption stands at around 10%. Efforts are being made to encourage high volume senders to be more efficient in their use of block space by batching transactions and implementing segwit. BitGo is one company proactively educating their customers on efficient use of block space. Melvin Carvalho raised concerns about the long-term security of Bitcoin once the reward goes away. Gregory Maxwell proposed making every transaction RBF by default and then encouraging other wallet developers to do the same via outreach and education. Lightning network adoption on mainnet is increasing, which leads to the prediction that over 1% of BTC transactions will be lightning-based by year end. Peter Todd questioned shabang.io's method of determining whether or not a transaction funded a Lightning channel.Overall, while frustration with high fees exists, the increased activity in the fee market bodes well for the long-term stability of Bitcoin. The discussion emphasizes the need for education and efficient use of block space to improve the user experience and ensure the long-term stability of Bitcoin.</p>
