    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There is a question about the possibility of making a hard fork of Bitcoin that incorporates Hash Graph. The legality of this action is debated due to the proprietary license of Hash Graph, but it is argued that its open algorithm could be implemented without violating the license while still giving value to existing cryptocurrency tokens and keys. Bitcoin's scalability problem is acknowledged, as its current limit of 6 transactions per second is insufficient for a global economy. While Lightning promises to solve this issue, it has not yet been fully implemented. A small amount of BTC was transferred to Ethereum using Coinomi wallet, which took several days on a low priority. The individual posing the question is a programmer with experience implementing algorithms, but has no notable experience with crypto algorithms specifically. No debug log is available at this time.</p>
