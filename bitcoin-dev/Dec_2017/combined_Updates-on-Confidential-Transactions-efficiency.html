        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Confidential transactions were proposed in 2013 by Adam Back to improve transaction privacy in Bitcoin. These transactions make the transaction amounts private and complement CoinJoin by avoiding the issue of joins being decoded due to different amounts used. However, the significant transaction size bloat was a problem as each confidential output typically required a witness which showed that the output value is in range. Recent work has focused on reducing the range proof size, with Benedikt BÃ¼nz at Stanford achieving an aggregate range proof for CT with a size of ~736 bytes for the 64-bit 2-output case.In addition to confidential transactions, Gregory Maxwell discussed approaches that could be constructed without new cryptographic assumptions and have no trusted setup or forever-growing unprunable accumulators. He suggested using accumulator epochs or merkelized key-value schemes to shift the costs of maintaining the accumulator to wallets, but acknowledged the tradeoffs of reduced k-anonymity set. The scalability and privacy of different transaction topologies were also discussed, with ring-in and tree-in approaches being more private but less scalable than CT+valueshuffle. A fourth topology was suggested, which involves taking N inputs and writing >=N outputs, replacing some coins with new outputs or encrypted dummies while re-encrypting others in a way that their owner can still decode.Bulletproofs, a new zero-knowledge proof system that shrinks the size of cryptographic proofs and makes them safer, was released by Gregory Maxwell and developed by researchers at UCL, Blockstream, and Stanford University, based on previous work by UCL's Jonathan Bootle. Andrew Poelstra implemented the single-output version of Bulletproofs, a cryptographic proof system that can prove statements about encrypted data, with some performance numbers. In an email exchange, Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell discuss the risks associated with privacy in cryptocurrency systems. Todd argues that privacy breaches threaten users' freedom, while Maxwell questions the feasibility of implementing perfectly hiding systems in practice. They also discuss the possibility of using switch commitments to retain computational-hiding-depending-on-the-hardness-of-inverting-hashes while retaining an option to upgrade or block spending via unsound mechanisms in the event of a crypto break.Maxwell believes that the interactive-sparse-in (CJ) approach has its own attractiveness. He discussed an approach that could be constructed without new cryptographic assumptions, be high-performance compared to alternatives, have no trusted setup, and not involve the creation of any forever-growing unprunable accumulators. Despite its drawbacks, Maxwell believes that this approach is feasible.Maxwell noted that ring-in and tree-in approaches, used by Monero and Zcash, are more private but less scalable than CT+valueshuffle. However, he also mentioned a fourth topology that is closely related to ring-in, which involves taking N inputs and writing >= N outputs, replacing some coins with new outputs or encrypted dummies while re-encrypting others in a way that their owner can still decode. This approach avoids the spent coins list by allowing for malleation of inputs.</p>
