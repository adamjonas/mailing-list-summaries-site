    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Damian Williamson and ZmnSCPxj, the former proposed a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) called "UTWFOTIB" which stands for "Use Transaction Weight For Ordering Transactions In Blocks". ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the proposal, stating that nodes are not expected to agree on the transaction pool and validating correct transactions in a block shouldn't be proposed. Instead, he suggests that consensus rules should only focus on the characteristics of the block and its transactions. ZmnSCPxj also points out that if a node is temporarily stopped, it may not have a view of the "consensus" transaction pool during that time and can only trust the longest chain. Therefore, strict fullnode rejection of blocks indicating a "next blocksize" that is too large or small according to the equation proposed by Williamson may not be feasible. Williamson intends to revise the proposal and provide more explanation before posting it back to the list.</p>
