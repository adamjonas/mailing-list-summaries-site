    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate about whether to use Bitcoin, Millibitcoin (mBTC) and Microbitcoin (µBTC) or "bits" as the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin has been ongoing. Some argue that bits are confusing because they are a computer science term with multiple meanings even within the same context. However, others point out that homonyms are used every day and our brains are able to interpret language based on context. Coinbase has been using bits as the default for over 2 years now, and from a linguistic standpoint, it's likely that bits will eventually become the standard. Those who understand the difference between BTC, mBTC, and µBTC may find bits unnecessary, but the majority of people may prefer the simpler option.</p>
