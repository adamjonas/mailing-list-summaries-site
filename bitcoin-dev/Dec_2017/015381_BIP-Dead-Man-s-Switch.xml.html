    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion among Bitcoin developers, some have proposed a system to encourage users to move their funds, with the intention of preventing long-term savings and encouraging more active use of Bitcoin. However, Nick Pudar, a developer, has expressed concern about the potential negative consequences of such a system. He believes it could force people to move funds around, introducing multiple opportunities for errors, and would nullify the purpose of cold storage. Additionally, Pudar warns that implementing such a system could create terrible incentives for miners. Miners may choose to censor transactions that move funds close to their expiration time to increase their own future rewards. Overall, Pudar is apprehensive about the proposal and recommends that cold storage should be able to stay cold.</p>
