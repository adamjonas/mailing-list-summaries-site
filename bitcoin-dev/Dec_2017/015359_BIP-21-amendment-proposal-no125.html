    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about using flags to disable specific operations, CryptAxe suggests an alternative solution of having an "-ignoredflags=x,y,z" section of the URI that can be used to ignore whatever BIP. However, it is noted that not all BIPs would work with this pattern and each ignored flag would require carefully defined behavior. Additionally, it is suggested that this BIP may soon be superseded entirely due to discussions of variations on BIP-71.Another topic in the discussion is the use of bech32 addresses. Luke Dashjr questions why there is a need for a param when bech32 addresses are just normal addresses. Sjors explains that most wallets consider bech32 addresses to be invalid and introduces the idea of using a backwards compatible P2SH address with a param to allow modern wallets to use bech32. This is encouraged as it is cheaper for the recipient to spend these funds, but merchants can eventually drop support for old wallets once the new format has sufficient adoption.</p>
