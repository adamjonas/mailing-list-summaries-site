    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach stated that every transaction is already replace-by-fee capable, and opt-in replace by fee is a fiction that was only relevant when fees were smaller than subsidy. The debate centered on whether or not to default opt-in replace by fee in Bitcoin Core. Electrum has been using opt-in replace by fee as default without issues. The discussion at the bitcoin core weekly IRC meeting suggested that it should be left off by default for the RPC due to concerns expressed by some industrial users. However, Friedenbach believes that those users are most likely to want it on and can easily change their settings upon release.</p>
