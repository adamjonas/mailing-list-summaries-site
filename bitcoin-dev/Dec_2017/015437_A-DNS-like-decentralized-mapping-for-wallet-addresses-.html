    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It has been suggested that it would be possible to develop a Bitcoin wallet with an integrated name to address mapping feature, which could even be based on Bitcoin Core. The mapping feature could also include names, strings and email addresses. However, relying on an additional service like DNS introduces an additional availability risk, although there is no additional privacy risk providing each mapped name or address was only used once to send/receive one payment unless something personally identifiable like an email address was used. It has been suggested that combining this with BIP-47 would be useful as payment codes could be associated with email via DNS. It has been proposed that the sender could email the recipient the information they need to retrieve funds and the transaction could have a time-locked refund in case the payment code is stale. The original proposal was part of an effort with Armory and Verisign to create something similar. A draft was produced which leveraged BIP32 and allowed payment requests to be generated that automatically pointed payees to the correct branch, however, it was not published. The DNSSEC system may have some issues but is considered the easiest way to bootstrap identity to a common, reasonably secure standard.</p>
