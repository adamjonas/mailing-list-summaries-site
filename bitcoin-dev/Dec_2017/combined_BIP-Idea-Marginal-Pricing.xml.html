        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article and email thread both discuss a proposal to change the way transaction fees are collected in Bitcoin. The current system includes Out of Band (OOB) fees, which have been present for most of Bitcoin's existence. The article argues that these fees are disincentivized by the system and proposes an economic approach to maximize total fee collection and hash power.The proposal suggests that miners implicitly choose the market sat/byte rate with the cheapest-fee transaction included in their block and remove the block size limit. This would lead to a dynamic block size limit regulated by profit motive, transaction fees maximized for every block, and no overpay. All fees would be fair. However, the article also explores concerns related to the proposal, including collusion among miners and various strategies that could arise in the world of OOB fees.The email thread discusses the same proposal, noting that it aims to reduce individual transaction fees by allowing users and services to bid higher transaction fees and have their excess bid refunded. The proposal would create two markets: a backlog market and a real-time market. Two scenarios were provided, one for a 5MB block and another for a 600KB block, with corresponding miner rewards. However, there were concerns over the feasibility of such a system and its potential risks.It is pointed out that the protocol has no ability to regulate fees and that miners and payers can accept zero fees natively in the protocol and instead accept (pay) their actual fees out-of-band or via OP_TRUE outputs. Ultimately, both the article and email thread propose changes to the current system in order to maximize total transaction fees and reduce individual transaction fees, but there are concerns over the feasibility and potential risks of implementing such changes.</p>
