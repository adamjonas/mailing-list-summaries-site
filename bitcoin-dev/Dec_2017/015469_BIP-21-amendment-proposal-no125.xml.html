    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the removal of "no-RBF" flag which is believed to confuse new users about the security of 0-conf transactions. The assumption made is that miners are profit maximizers, and they will replace low fee transactions with higher fee ones irrespective of the flag being present or not, making full RBF a de facto policy in Bitcoin. The removal of the flag and adoption of full RBF as "de jure" policy is recommended along with more outreach and education to clarify the risks of 0-conf and how miners can earn more profits by adopting full RBF. On the other hand, there are some legitimate reasons why people use non-RBF transactions despite their poor usability, and if people want to overpay on fees for it, then there is no reason not to let them. There is strong support for including the flag but the anticipation is of very low usage of the flag. Finally, objections have been raised against the no-RBF flag, as it seems counterproductive and doesn't reduce the risk of double-spending or prevent it.</p>
