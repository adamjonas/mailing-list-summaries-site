        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach noted that every transaction is capable of replace-by-fee, despite its specification in BIP 125. Friedenbach believes that electrum has been defaulting to opt-in without any issues and discussed the possibility of defaulting it on for the RPC. He personally celebrates the market behavior producing activity levels that can pay for security without inflation and stabilizes consensus progress as the subsidy declines. In addition, he suggests that we should look at difficult-to-forge market signals rather than just claims when considering fee reduction. Melvin Carvalho also chimed in with concerns that fees are now approximately 45% of the block reward, with congestion at an all-time high and that this may be prohibitive for some use cases. Furthermore, adoption of segwit has only reached approximately 10%, and there may be legitimate concerns about long-term security. However, Carvalho notes that these data points are mainly for informational purposes.</p>
