        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made in Bitcoin development to include nBits in messages where the value is ambiguous. This would allow for calculating work on a chain and could be used as an anti-DoS measure, even without verifying that the difficulty adjustments are following the consensus rules. The proposal suggests introducing a new 'cmpctheaders'/'getcmpcthdrs' message pair for syncing using this new message type while leaving the existing 'headers'/'getheaders' messages unchanged. It is suggested that splitting off the headers chain-sync functionality to a new message pair would be beneficial in the long run. However, the existing protocol will have to be supported for a long time. To ensure compatibility, it is important to consider that many altcoins also change the header structures. Therefore, changing the serialization of existing messages is not preferred because nodes will have to support speaking both messages for a long time. Another proposal discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list aims to optimize the transmission of Bitcoin headers. The suggestion is that when sending a stream of continuous block headers, starting with the second header, the previous hash could be avoided in the transmission because the receiver could compute it by double hashing the previous header. This would lead to bandwidth savings of around 40%. Suggestions were also made for improvements to the protocol interface and consensus rules surrounding nBits and difficulty management. The OpenTimestamps calendars will use this compression to provide lite clients with reasonable secure proofs. Similarly, Electrum aims to start with the download of a file containing the first 477,637 headers to speed up client sync. A common HTTP API with fixed position chunks could also be useful for fast syncing the headers.</p>
