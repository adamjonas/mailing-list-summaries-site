    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to Luke Dashjr, Damian Williamson apologized for his mistake of self-assigning BIP number 177 and suggested linking important information in the list welcome email. In response, Luke reminded him to follow the guidelines outlined in BIP 2 and not to self-assign numbers. Damian had proposed a solution to transactional reliability issues in Bitcoin where valid transactions are stuck in the mempool for extended periods. The two key issues he aimed to resolve were the current transaction bandwidth limit and the current ad-hoc methods of including transactions in blocks resulting in variable and confusing confirmation times for valid transactions. Damian's proposal protects the value of fees by proposing a stable fee for priority service auction model instead of an auction model for limited bandwidth. He planned to post the full proposal on his blog after incorporating feedback from various sources. Links to previous threads on this proposal were also provided.</p>
