    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a DNS-like decentralized mapping service for crypto addresses was put forth on bitcoin-dev mailing list. A few years ago, Armory and Verisign had attempted such a project which was documented in draft-wiley-paymentassoc-00. The project was able to leverage BIP32 and allow payment requests to be generated that automatically pointed payees to the correct branch. Douglas Roark, who worked on the project, believes it is an interesting draft that could be turned into something useful. He also suggests that DNSSEC would be the easiest way to bootstrap identity to a common, reasonably secure standard.</p>
