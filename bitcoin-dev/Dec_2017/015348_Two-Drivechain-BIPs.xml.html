    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this context argues that the security model for sidechains is the same as that of every blockchain. They also refute claims that 51% hashrate can steal coins in sidechains, stating that this is also true of the mainchain. However, they note that there are substantial opportunity costs and a collective action problem when it comes to re-writing the mainchain. The author questions whether there is anything similar for drivechains, as they see no opportunity cost or repercussions for casting a malicious vote, nor any collective action barrier to overcome. Ultimately, the author concludes that unless they are missing something, they would not liken the security of a drivechain to that of the mainchain.</p>
