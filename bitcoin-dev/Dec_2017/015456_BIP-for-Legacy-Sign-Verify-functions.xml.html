    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dan Bryant criticized a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by Brian Deery. The BIP proposes adding a "verify messages" feature to Bitcoin wallets that would allow users to verify ownership of a particular Bitcoin address by signing a message with the associated private key. However, Bryant claimed that the proposal was incorrect because it suggests that a public key can be derived from a Bitcoin address, which is not possible. Instead, the proposed feature would use signature and message to perform key recovery and extract the public key of the signer to compare it to the address provided. Deery's proposal aims to establish a reference point for future expansion of these capabilities into new address schemes. However, Luke Dashjr commented that new schemes should not be based on the current one.</p>
