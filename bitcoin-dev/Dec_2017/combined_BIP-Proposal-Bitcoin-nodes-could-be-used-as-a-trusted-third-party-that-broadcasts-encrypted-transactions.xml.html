        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal suggests using full Bitcoin nodes as simple trusted third parties in a secure multi-party computation to ensure fairness. The randomly selected node would generate an encrypted Bitcoin transaction that could only be decrypted and broadcast by the selected node, ensuring no players gain any information about the outcome until they see the unconfirmed transaction in the mempool. Alice and Bob choose a random full Bitcoin node that supports this new protocol. After the selection of the node, Alice sends the request to the selected node, which generates a one-time-use key pair and encrypts the one-time private key using its static public key. The example protocol uses a single TTP node, but it would be more secure if parties randomly select a large number of nodes. Shamir's Secret Sharing could be used so that n of t nodes are needed to decrypt the transaction, and the MPC could encrypt the individual key parts using each node's public key. People could anonymously vote on the distribution of funds without revealing their vote to anyone, and there would also be the possibility to create a fully decentralized Bitcoin lottery.</p>
