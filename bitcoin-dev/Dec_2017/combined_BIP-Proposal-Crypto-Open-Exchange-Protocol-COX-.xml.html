        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Nicolas Dorier, a developer, has proposed a simple protocol called Crypto Open Exchange Protocol (COX), which aims to decouple payment processors from exchanges. COX provides a way for merchants to protect against cryptocurrency volatility and gives them the freedom to choose their own payment processor solution while exchanges give them a way to compete with larger exchanges like Bitpay. The COX protocol is aimed towards local exchanges that do not have the resources to develop their own payment solutions.To use the protocol, the merchant logs in to their exchange website, goes to the "Address sources" section of it, and clicks on "Create a new address source". They are then asked what to do when cryptocurrency is sent to this address source, and receive an "address source URI" which they can input inside the payment processor. An exchange compatible with COX would reply to any HTTP POST request to this "address source URI", returning the following information: a deposit address for accepting payment, the current rate, and if willing to take the risk of rate fluctuation, until when this rate is guaranteed and under which conditions.The COX protocol does not require adoption by exchanges, as an adapter service could be used to translate it to the exchange's proprietary API. However, using an adapter could create additional risks depending on API key permissions and merchant infrastructure. The proposal suggests adding an invoice mechanism similar to Lightning, where a pre-image is sent to the user's wallet upon receipt of funds, which can be presented to the merchant in case of any issues. This could alleviate the burden of dealing with user support requests from exchanges.The current currencyCode and cryptoCurrencyCode system assumes that merchants will always want to sell for fiat, but some may prefer another cryptocurrency instead. To address this, a suggestion has been made to make the system more generic by using buySymbol and sellSymbol instead. Making the system more generic would benefit both merchants and customers by providing greater choice and flexibility in transactions.Overall, the proposal aims to simplify the payment process and reduce potential risks for merchants. The COX protocol is currently a draft and can be found on Github. It is dual-licensed as BSD 3-clause and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.</p>
