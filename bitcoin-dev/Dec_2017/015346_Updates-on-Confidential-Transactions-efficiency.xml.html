    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andrew Poelstra has implemented the single-output version of Bulletproofs, a cryptographic proof system that can prove statements about encrypted data, with some performance numbers. The benchmarks were performed on one core of an Intel i7-6820MQ, and reflect verification of a single 64-bit rangeproof. By using GLV endomorphism supported by the curve secp256k1, which libsecp256k1 (supported by Bitcoin) supports but does not enable by default, speedup was observed. It reflects a 3.47x speedup over the verification speed of the old rangeproofs without the endomorphism. Even without aggregation, two rangeproofs are verified nearly 15% faster than verifying one twice. The old rangeproofs require only 128 multiplies for a 64-bit proof, then 256 for two, and so on, while at the same time the new Bulletproofs perform significantly better. The Bulletproof verification process is a recursive process which does not appear to be expressible as a single multiproduct, and in fact it appears to require nearly twice as many multiplications as claimed. There are still a few open issues that Andrew plans to help resolve in the coming month.</p>
