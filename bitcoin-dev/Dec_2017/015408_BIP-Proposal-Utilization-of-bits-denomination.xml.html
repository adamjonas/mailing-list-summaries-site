    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The argument that only those who can easily tell the difference understand 24 bit audio or 256 bit cryptography is presented. The post argues that the problem of using "bits" as a term for Bitcoin denominations won't exist in reality. A response to this post is provided by Correct wrote, who reposts a comment by BashCo discussing homonyms and how they are interpreted by the brain based on context. The post argues that beginners will not be able to distinguish between the different meanings of "bits" within the same context and provides examples of potential confusion when discussing things like 24 bit audio resolution or 24 bit price versus 256 bit keys' size or value. The poster suggests that while people on the forum may understand these distinctions, others may not and that bits could cause confusion.</p>
