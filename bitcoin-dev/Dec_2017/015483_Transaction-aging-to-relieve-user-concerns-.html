    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is considering proposing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that expands the transaction format to include chain-height (block number) in the TXN. This would allow nodes/miners to age the TXN and choose not to rebroadcast it after a certain age threshold. Currently, nodes/miners keep a "seen-list" of TXNs and age them based on when they were last seen. The downside to this is that those TXNs could be broadcast forever, assuming the UTXO never got spent. The goal is not to enhance the protocol but rather make it easier for users to know with better certainty when a TXN is going to age out. Possible abuse vectors might include a bad party broadcasting a low fee TXN at the edge of the age-out threshold and trying to get goods, realizing the TXN will age out at the very next block. If this proposal might be something that core would entertain in a BIP proposal, the author will start drafting something.</p>
