    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Reddit user has presented an analysis on blind merged mining (BMM) and drivechains, which is shared for visibility. The post highlights the disconnect between voting and "blind" merge mining and outlines eight different strategies miners can use with BMM, including allowing theft and strangling the chain. The security model for sidechains is said to be the same as that of every blockchain, but there are no opportunity costs or collective action barriers to casting a malicious vote in drivechains, making it less secure than the mainchain. It is noted that if enough miners employ the most profitable strategy of downvoting withdrawal transactions, a withdrawal will never occur from the drivechain.</p>
