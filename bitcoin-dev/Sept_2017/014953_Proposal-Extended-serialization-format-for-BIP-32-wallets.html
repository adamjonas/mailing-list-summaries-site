    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list was about using a block height or a timestamp for XPUB. It was pointed out that block height depends on the chain while XPUB is not tied to any particular chain/coin. Additionally, some cryptocurrencies use directed acyclic graph (DAG) instead of blockchain for storing transactions, making it unclear what number to use as a block height. However, all blockchains contain timestamps in their blocks, which can be used for XPUB. Even for blockchains that don't contain timestamps, their blocks exist in our spacetime continuum and are created at a specific point in time. The author expressed interest in hearing about a blockchain that does not occupy our spacetime continuum.</p>
