    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Chris Priest suggested that sending wallets should check if the recipient address has been used before, to prevent users from accidentally sending funds to an already-used address. However, this proposal was met with concerns over scalability, as it would require every wallet to have all the addresses ever used and a fast index into them. Another proposed solution was to consult an address expiration service before sending funds, but this raised privacy concerns as it would require disclosing which addresses the user plans to pay.</p>
