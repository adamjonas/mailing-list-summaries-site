        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Luca Venturini has proposed a protocol that uses the Bitcoin blockchain to manage tokens. The protocol enables atomic buy and sell transactions between tokens and Bitcoin, as well as between different types of tokens. Tokens can be managed using any existing Bitcoin wallet, and the protocol allows for token offering issuance transactions, atomic exchange transactions, and cross-token atomic transactions. Tokens are not burned or deleted and can be divided indefinitely, with any number of decimals.The protocol is designed to enable semantic layering, which means that bitcoin transactions can be read as operations related to tokens. It also permits plausible deniability while allowing stateful public auditability on each issued token. This means that every operation of the protocol is performed with Bitcoin transactions without the use of OP_RETURN, ensuring that there is no pollution of the blockchain or the UTXO set.The issuance of tokens can be done automatically upon receiving bitcoins, and tokens of different types can be held by the same address and by the same output. Tokens can also be identified using only the first characters of the Bitcoin address if the characters are different from every previous Bitcoin address seen in the blockchain. The document describes the transaction format for issuance and transfer of tokens, including those generated from split and join transactions. It explains how the outputs of a transaction determine who receives the tokens and how to assign remaining tokens to a cut output. Furthermore, it outlines the process of token offering issuance transactions, including setting predefined prices and rates and issuing tokens at different prices through multiple issuance transactions. The protocol also introduces the concept of atomic exchange transactions, where tokens and bitcoins can be exchanged simultaneously in a single transaction. Cross-token atomic transactions allow for the exchange of tokens between two parties, even if they are of different values. Guidelines are provided on how to manage tokens using any existing wallet without the need for technical knowledge of the rest of the protocol. These guidelines are based on the use of a "consolidated" wallet, which contains only one output at any given time.The document also includes technical notes on consolidated wallets and UTXOs, and a reference implementation will be available once the protocol is reviewed and accepted by the community. Luca Venturini clarified that plausible deniability is a property of the protocol that allows for public auditability of each issued token while permitting denial by both issuer and user. Memorable names can be used for social scalability, with vanity addresses being optional. In a basic use case scenario, the protocol enables Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Daniel to start a new company where everyone contributes to the company with a percentage of value. They issue tokens, and every shareholder can freely resell their shares to others. The issuance remains open, but it is decided to close it by sending bitcoins from Alice's wallet to addresses of her same wallet, using the change output of the previous transaction as an input. Later, Bob decides to give some shares of the company to his husband Giacomo, and a new transaction is generated that spends the output of the issuance transaction. This transaction gives 8 shares of the company to Giacomo. Daniel wants to sell 3 of his 14 shares to Frank, and they decide to make an atomic transaction, where Frank pays 0.00969600 bitcoins to Daniel and receives three shares. Overall, this proposal offers a simple and efficient way to manage tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for dedicated wallets or verification nodes.</p>
