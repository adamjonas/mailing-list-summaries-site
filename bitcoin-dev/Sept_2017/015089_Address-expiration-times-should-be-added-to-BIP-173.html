    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around concerns regarding the use of BIP-70 payment protocol. The protocol was considered redundant, as it had a significant overhead and required a back and forth process. Instead, sending or printing a Bitcoin address on an invoice was seen as easier. However, Andreas Schildbach argued that a payment request message was just as one-way as an address and could be emailed or printed on an invoice. The conversation then moved to whether an expiry date could be included in a BIP-173 address, which would not violate the BIP-70 spec. It was suggested that tools generating BIP-70 payment requests could avoid setting the optional expiry date, or scan the date and set the expires field to the same value, although this was not confirmed.</p>
