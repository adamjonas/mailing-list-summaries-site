        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin development community has been discussing their policy around vulnerability disclosure in recent email threads. The existing policy involves reporting vulnerabilities to security at bitcoincore.org and dealing with critical issues immediately through a released patch, wide notification of the need to upgrade, and minimal disclosure of the actual problem. Non-critical vulnerabilities are dealt with through the ordinary flow of development, including patch and review, and backport of a fix or workaround from master to the current released version.However, the challenge lies in disclosing vulnerabilities in altcoins that are running old, unpatched forks of Bitcoin Core. Matt Corallo expressed concern over the difficulty of disclosing issues without putting people at risk and encouraged discussion on reasonable approaches to take. Suggestions such as a responsible disclosure timeline were proposed, where vulnerability is reported privately followed by sharing details amongst a trusted group before releasing patches.Furthermore, Daniel Stadulis proposed treating different bug severity levels with different response plans and compared this to Monero's three-level response process, which varies the response for each level of severity. Monero treats HIGH as an emergency, MEDIUM gets fixed in a point release, and LOW gets deferred to the next regular release.There is also a proposal to transition from keeping things private indefinitely to having a public disclosure policy, starting with releasing information about security vulnerabilities fixed in earlier versions, with a regular policy adopted thereafter. Overall, the community is interested in finding reasonable approaches to disclosing vulnerabilities that can be taken without putting users at risk while also ensuring that altcoins are kept up-to-date with security fixes. There is also a need for better documentation of the security policy and an up-to-date list of Bitcoin Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that could be shared with other developers.In another thread, Sergio Demian Lerner raised concerns about researchers' inability to report vulnerabilities previously reported in altcoins that have different policies. While the author agreed with Lerner's point, he clarified on the use of "can't." He stated that if someone wants to report something to the Bitcoin project, then they are at their mercy in how they handle it. However, if the researcher wants to go ahead and report common issues to something else with a different approach, they can.The author emphasized the importance of collaboration and working together to build highly defensible evolving systems while handling knowledge of vulnerabilities with caution. It was suggested that a small group of trustworthy altcoin developers could be identified, but if this was not possible, it would still be better to eventually disclose publicly than keep the vulnerability unrevealed. It was also argued that good security for Bitcoin is not solely defined by constant upgrading, but rather by knowing that the definition of money has not changed. Efforts into backporting fixes/workarounds and contributing to patches could help both altcoins and Bitcoin investors/traders.</p>
