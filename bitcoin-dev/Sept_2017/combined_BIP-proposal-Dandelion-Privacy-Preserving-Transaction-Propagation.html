        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Dandelion project proposes a modification to Bitcoin's transaction propagation mechanism to enhance privacy by obscuring the source IP of each transaction. The protocol includes a two-phase approach where transactions first enter the "stem" phase before the "fluff" phase, with each node relaying the transaction to a single peer during the stem phase. The team has developed a new variant called Per-Incoming-Edge routing to prevent intersection attacks. However, there are still concerns about the Mempool Embargo approach, and alternative constructions have been proposed. The proposal also includes an experiment to compare the learning rate of attackers under diffusion and Dandelion. Feedback is being sought on the implementation details related to these points. The team has completed additional theoretical analysis and simulations, built a working prototype, and written detailed documentation for the new implementation. While the guarantees of anonymity are probabilistic, individuals who are worried about targeted deanonymization should still use Tor. However, Dandelion is seen as a "public health" fix or an "anonymity vaccination" where higher adoption leads to greater benefits, even for those who are not using Tor.A group of researchers has introduced a privacy solution called Dandelion to provide formal anonymity guarantees for Bitcoin users. The protocol sends transactions over a randomly selected path before diffusion, preventing attacks by sending them during the "stem phase" and then diffusing them during the "fluff phase". The team recommends not allowing fee filters from peers to influence the choice of route and suggests automatically fluffing or applying fee filters in the stempool. A node's stempool should accept and propagate Dandelion transactions that depend on other unconfirmed normal mempool transactions.Stem orphans can occur when a node on the stem shuffles its route between sending dependent transactions. The team suggests re-broadcasting all previous Dandelion transactions that have not been fluffed after Dandelion route shuffling or waiting for the fluff phase to begin, at which point the orphans will be resolved. The Dandelion team has received feedback from Pieter Wuille on their protocol and implementation, and they plan to prioritize writing a clearer specification for node behavior in the BIP. Feedback is being sought on the implementation details related to the "Mempool Embargo" mechanism.A discussion was held on deploying Dandelion relays, and it was suggested to choose Dandelion relays regardless of whether they support Dandelion or not, with transactions being fluffed if the chosen nodes do not support it and relayed along a stem if they do. Wallets may have a configuration option for the use of stem forwarding, which will initially be hidden and set to off. In a subsequent release after widespread deployment, the option will be unhidden and defaulted to on, so users don't begin using it until the deployment is relatively dense.Bradley Denby's proposal to improve privacy in the Bitcoin P2P network with the Dandelion protocol aims to provide greater anonymity for users by ensuring that transactions are routed through a number of different nodes before being broadcast to the wider network. The Dandelion team found that making routing decisions based on claims made by peer nodes can cause problems and recommends against biasing the peer selection code. On the implementation side, the team applies the same logic to the stempool as the mempool in the reference implementation. They suggest using scheduler jobs instead of a separate thread for shuffling the routes. The iteration of Dandelion has been tested on the team's small network, and they would like to get the implementation in front of a wider audience. An updated BIP document with further details on motivation, specification, compatibility, and implementation can be found on Github.</p>
