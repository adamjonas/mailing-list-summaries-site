    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Cserveny Tamas raised concerns about miners adding capacity to the network, stating that it would only increase their share of the block reward without increasing the speed of transactions. However, it was pointed out that adding more space to blocks does increase the throughput speed of transactions and does not affect the block reward. Additionally, Tamas claimed that raising the fee in the long run with decreasing block rewards would be the result, but this has not been the case. Tamas also stated that the current chain is effectively single threaded, which was refuted by Tom Zander. With the introduction of xthin/compactblocks, the network bottleneck has been removed, allowing for continuous parallel validation of transactions rather than just when a block is found. Zander provides further insights on his personal blog and vlog channels.</p>
