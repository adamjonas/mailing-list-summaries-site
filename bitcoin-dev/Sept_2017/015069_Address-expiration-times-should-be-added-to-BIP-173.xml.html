    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests a better solution for the popup alert that appears when sending bitcoins to an address with a history. The proposal is to have the sending wallet check if the address has been used before, and if it's fresh, then it sends it through without any popup alert. However, if the address has a history going back a certain period of time, then a popup comes up to notify the sender that they are sending to a non-fresh address that may no longer be controlled by the receiver anymore.Furthermore, another idea discussed was to set up an "address expiration service" where before deleting a wallet, an "expiration notice" is sent off stating that the address is about to be deleted, and providing a new address. When someone tries to send to the deleted address, they consult the address expiration service, which either tells them to proceed or provides an alternative address instead. This process is similar to a 301 redirect, but for addresses. It was suggested that address expiration should not be part of the protocol. The developers still need to make sure that during the first start up after updating with this popup, the wallet scans for addresses that have been used in the past. This way, the popup isn't only shown for addresses that are reused after updating.
