    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is interested in the possibility of creating a cryptocurrency software that has immutable consensus rules. The main goal of such a cryptocurrency is to provide certainty and predictability for investors, making it a long-term store of value. This would also reduce the likelihood of bugs and attacks on the system, improving security. While hard forks are always possible, soft forks drag people along with them, which can be problematic for a coin with permanent consensus rule immutability as an ethos.The writer asks if removing anyone-can-spend transactions from bitcoin would prevent soft forks or if there are other mechanisms at play. They also inquire about the importance of anyone-can-spend transactions for other uses. Additionally, they ask if it is possible to programmatically avoid/ban soft forks and how one would go about it.</p>
