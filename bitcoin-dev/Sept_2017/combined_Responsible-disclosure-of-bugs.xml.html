        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin project has a de facto policy that vulnerabilities should be reported via security at bitcoincore.org. Critical issues are dealt with by releasing a patch as soon as possible, wide notification of the need to upgrade (or to disable affected systems), and minimal disclosure of the actual problem to delay attacks. Non-critical vulnerabilities are dealt with by patch and review undertaken in the ordinary flow of development, backport of a fix or workaround from master to the current released version. Devs attempt to ensure that publication of the fix does not reveal the nature of the vulnerability.Prior to a vulnerability becoming public, devs generally recommend that friendly altcoin devs catch up with fixes. Bitcoin devs won't disclose vulnerability details until >80% of bitcoin nodes have deployed the fixes, and they will never disclose vulnerabilities publicly while affected code may still be in use. Documenting security policy gives attackers a better handle on where to find weak points, so the main benefit of public vulnerability disclosure is a better working relationship with security researchers and perhaps better understanding of what sort of bugs happen in practice in general.For embargoed fixes, specific fixes are tested against experienced developers inside the project, handing them the proposed commit and informing them that it fixes a vulnerability and asking them to identify it. This does not guarantee that the fix won't leak the issue, but in virtually all cases in the past, the issues have dealt with would not be made worse off being leaked in that way vs just making it public outright.The need to publicly disclose security vulnerabilities fixed in previous releases of Bitcoin is a topic that has been under discussion. Alex Morcos has raised concerns about the difficulty in knowing which altcoin developers to disclose to, and the fact that good security for Bitcoin is not defined by constant upgrading as with other software. On the other hand, Aaron Joni proposed building up to the disclosure gradually, starting at some point in time and continuing with future releases. He also suggested that altcoin maintainers contribute back to their upstream to help keep up with security fixes.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing the need for different bug severity levels to have different response plans. However, it is not always clear cut as issues that seem hard to exploit can turn out to be trivial once the right trick is found. Simple performance bugs can potentially be used to carve up the network and cause problems. With regards to altcoins that are running old, unpatched forks of Bitcoin Core, it is difficult to disclose issues without putting people at risk. The list has encouraged a discussion about what reasonable approaches could be taken there. Additionally, the list has brought up the discussion of "Bitcoin and CVEs" which has gone unanswered for 6 months. There have been no new CVEs posted for almost three years, except for CVE-2015-3641, but there appears to be no information publicly available for that issue.</p>
