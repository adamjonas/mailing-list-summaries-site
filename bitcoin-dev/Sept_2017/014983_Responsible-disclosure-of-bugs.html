    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the responsibility to defend all types of users and software from potential threats, even if the software is not maintained or advocated by an individual. The author emphasizes that disclosing knowledge of a vulnerability should be handled with caution, as it can have serious consequences beyond what was initially expected. In addition, the author argues that it is important to keep in mind the reputational aspect in disclosing such information, as it may harm one's credibility in security work. While it may be tempting to take an absolutist approach, the author advocates for continuing to work on highly defensible software and keeping vigilant in regards to security. Ultimately, the author believes that there should be a general understanding in the community that people collaborate and work together to build highly defensible evolving systems, without encouraging each other to actively bring about the eschaton by mishandling knowledge of vulnerabilities.</p>
