    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on making it possible for transactions to become invalid after the fact has been brought up in the past, with severe downsides being noted. A suggestion was made to include an expiration time in the protocol, which would remove the need for refund logic or asking a customer to pay a few extra cents and disallow a second payment, however, privacy concerns and the potential for miners to game the system were identified as downsides. The resolution of the expiration time was also discussed, with suggestions for hour or month resolutions. It was noted that a large range is necessary as expiry times will inevitably be specified absolutely, not relatively; when the range runs out, an upgrade to the standard is needed. There was no mention of any attachments or URLs in this email thread.</p>
