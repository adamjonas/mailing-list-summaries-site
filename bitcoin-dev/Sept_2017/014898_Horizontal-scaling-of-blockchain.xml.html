    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>According to a message thread, it was suggested that the current Bitcoin chain is effectively single threaded, but this is not true since xthin/compactblocks have been introduced. This new technology has completely removed the bottleneck and transactions will be validated continuously in parallel, rather than just when a block is found. However, it was also mentioned that the original statement may have been referring to the behavior of the entire Bitcoin distributed system as a single threaded computation, similar to what IOTA uses, where the task of validating transactions is distributed among miners. Without more specific details, it is difficult to judge the benefits of this approach.</p>
