    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach highlighted an error in which a participant had referred to a "clean stack" rather than an "unclean stack". This same mistake was also pointed out by another participant at the recent CoreDev meetup where the idea was presented. The discussion also included the topic of code complexity in relation to the BIP114 implementation and whether it could be simplified. A question was raised regarding whether there is a repository that contains the latest implementation of BIP 114 for comparison purposes. The original BIP114 can be found on Github and has since been revised by jl2012, with both versions being made available on their respective repositories. These links were provided within the discussion thread. Bryan, who initiated the email, included his contact information at the end.</p>
