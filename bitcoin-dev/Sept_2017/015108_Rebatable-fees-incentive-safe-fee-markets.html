    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses a proposed fix to the fee model that is not easily broken by paying the miner out of band. However, CPFP can break this as a miner getting paid out of band would make the block look legitimate for CPFP as long as every transaction in (1) has an output spent in (3). The person proposing the solution believes that it would be cheaper overall than the fee refund transactions as well. People making arrangements with miners directly would have to pay for block space to cover their payments and actual spend their change. A miner might be willing to charge a two-part tariff: a very high "subscription" fee that's paid once a year or similar along with very low per-tx fees. It is believed that reliability-based-price-discrimination might allow higher mining revenue via having txes with differing fee rates in the same block. The email further suggests that ideally, it would probably be better to let the block weight limit adjust to deal with high-frequency components to changes in demand, and have fee rates adjust more slowly to address the long-term trends in changes to demand.</p>
