    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 27, 2017, a discussion took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a license for an alternative to the modulo reduction. Cory Fields wrote in response, referencing a comment in cuckoocache.h. The reference was unrelated to the code but rather a found-on-the-internet explanation for a well-known technique used in fixed point signal processing. It is a trivial and old technique that has been seen in code since at least the 1980s. The purpose of the comment was to provide clarity for those who were confused by the code in another project. The link to the site was added after the code as it provided helpful information about the technique used.</p>
