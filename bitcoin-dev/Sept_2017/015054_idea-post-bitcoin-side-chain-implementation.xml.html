    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Patrick proposed the idea of a non-official sidechain that would be able to distribute rewards and enable users to share their burden. However, ZmnSCPxj pointed out that most sidechain proposals use merge mining to provide security similar to the main chain. ZmnSCPxj suggested "blind" merge mining or publishing entire sidechain block headers on the main chain to achieve this. Moreover, ZmnSCPxj recommended calling this system "sharding" rather than "sidechain", as sharding is a hard problem that requires protection against double-spending. Additionally, Patrick withdrew his proposal after being enlightened about lightning network, pruning, and sharding, realizing that these technologies accomplish everything he had set out to do.</p>
