    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim贸n raised a concern regarding the creation of 0-value outputs that are spendable and can potentially stay in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) forever. Tim贸n suggested that requiring at least 1 satoshi per output may be slightly better than the current situation, although it doesn't do much against a spam attack to the UTXO. He also questioned whether there is any reason or use case to keep allowing spendable outputs with null amounts in them. In response to Tim贸n's email, another member noted that as long as unspendable outputs with amount=0 are still allowed, he doesn't see it being an issue for anything. The member did not see this as a priority or very important matter. There was a proposal to create a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) with code to address the concern raised by Tim贸n. However, it is unclear whether this proposal was implemented or not.</p>
