    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Good morning bitcoin-dev,ZmnSCPxj has proposed a new sidechain idea that claims to have improved features when compared to drivechains. The proposal contains some unconventional claims which are detailed in the link provided. According to ZmnSCPxj, his proposal would make a 51% mainchain miner theft more difficult than in drivechains by requiring months of broadcasting intent to steal or locking funds for an entire week-long theft. Additionally, a 26% anti-sidechain miner could not completely block all sidechain withdrawals as they could in drivechains. The proposal suggests that outside of attacks and censorship, the economic majority controls sidechains without miners acting as "representatives of the economic majority". Lastly, ZmnSCPxj claims that proof-of-stake can be made to work with enough cleverness. While he acknowledges that he might not have thought everything through and may have missed some significant flaws, he submits this proposal for consideration.</p>
