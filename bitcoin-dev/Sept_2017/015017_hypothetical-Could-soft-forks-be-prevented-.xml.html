    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It is discussed in this email conversation whether it is possible to prevent soft forks in a cryptocurrency software that strives for immutable consensus rules. The discussion involves the use of "anyone-can-spend" transactions and how they are required for soft forks. It is stated that banning all anyone-can-spend transactions is not practically possible as there are too many potential scriptPubKey that anyone can spend. Soft forks apply further restrictions on Bitcoin, whereas hard forks do not, making them harder to detect. However, if everyone else is entering a soft fork and we are oblivious, we do not even know about it. Thus the only way to prevent soft fork is to hard fork against the new soft fork. The conversation also touches on the possibility of programmatically avoiding/banning soft-forks, and if so, how would one go about it.</p>
