    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Mark Friedenbach proposed a new way of fixing fee model in which paying out of band will not break the system unlike other proposed fixes. However, Peter Todd pointed out that this proposed fix itself is broken as miners can include only transactions paying out-of-band and set any fee. Furthermore, miners can also provide fee rebates for making deals, which will force up prices for other users. Friedenbach argued that this proposal creates a penalty for out of band payments, but Todd disagreed and said that it adds complexity without balancing the playing field. He suggested that the proposal only considers first order effects and ignores second order effects.</p>
