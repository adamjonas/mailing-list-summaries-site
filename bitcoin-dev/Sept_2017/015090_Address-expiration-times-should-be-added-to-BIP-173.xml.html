    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is about whether BIP-70 payment requests should be rendered with bech32, a new address format introduced in Bitcoin SegWit. The original poster had concerns about including an expiry date in a BIP-173 address and putting it into a payment request, as wallets wouldn't be able to parse the expiry date without violating the BIP70 specification. The conversation also touched on whether tools that generate BIP-70 payment requests generate addresses themselves or if they are input manually by a user. Finally, there was some discussion on the complexity of having multiple optional expiration dates in the specs and implementations, and the potential for mismatched dates. Overall, the conversation focused on the technical details and implications of using different address formats in BIP-70 payment requests.</p>
