    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion between Kabuto Samourai and Pavol Rusnak revolved around the inclusion of 'Birthday' field in SPV wallet. This development has been a long time coming for SPV wallet developers as it aids with initial scans. As a result, an SPV wallet will only download blocks from the blockchain after its Birthday, rather than downloading all blocks. Furthermore, test vectors were requested to be added by Kabuto Samourai, which would be implemented once agreed upon. A few minor grammar and spelling errors were also pointed out, which will be nitpicked at later stages.</p>
