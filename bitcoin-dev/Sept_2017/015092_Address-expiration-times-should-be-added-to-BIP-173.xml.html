    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list was about using an expiry date in a BIP-173 address and putting that into a payment request. Sjors Provoost argued that the payment protocol had significant overhead and required back and forth, while emailing or printing a bitcoin address was easier. Andreas Schildbach disagreed, stating that the payment request was just as one-way as an address. There were concerns that wallets would not be able to parse the expiry date from the script without violating the BIP70 specification. Luke suggested that it did not make sense to talk about putting a Bech32 address into a payment request since payment requests don't use or overlap with addresses.</p>
