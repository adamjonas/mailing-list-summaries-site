    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The licensing of Bitcoin Core has been examined by Black Duck Software, who scanned the code for open source licenses. The scan revealed that the code base includes code licensed under a variety of licenses, such as Apache License 2.0, Boost Software License 1.0, and MIT License, among others. However, some of the licenses are incompatible with each other, such as code licensed under the Apache Software License version 2 and GPLv2, which cannot work together in certain situations. Mark Radcliffe, a lawyer, requested to communicate with the individuals who manage this codebase to gain insight about how the project manages contributions. He will be presenting in a webinar with Black Duck Software on Blockchain on September 28. It should be noted that the components of the Bitcoin protocol (node, miner, wallet) can use different licenses as long as they are well structured and inter APIs are well defined and encapsulated.</p>
