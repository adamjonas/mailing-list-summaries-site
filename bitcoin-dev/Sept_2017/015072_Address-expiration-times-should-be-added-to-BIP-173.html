    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on how to prevent the use of stale addresses in Bitcoin transactions, Chris Priest suggested that wallets should check if the address has been used before sending bitcoins. However, Peter Todd pointed out that his concern is not re-used addresses but rather stale addresses that recipients would not like to be used anymore. He added that this often happens even if the address has never been used. The conversation took place on September 27, 2017, via email.</p>
