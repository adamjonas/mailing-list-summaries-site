    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, cdecker suggested having a sign-off mechanism for changes to BIPs. Currently, only the original author(s) can sign off on changes, but expanding this to 2-3 community members could be beneficial. This would involve attesting that the meaning of the BIP did not change. Another proposal was made by Luke Dashjr to modify BIP 2 to allow editors to merge changes without involving the authors. However, Bryan Bishop expressed concern that even minor revisions could impact the meaning of the text and suggested that edits should be mentioned in the changelog or that readers be made aware of the primary authors not reviewing suggested changes. The discussion highlights the need for careful consideration when making changes to BIPs, as small alterations can have significant impacts on the meaning of the text.</p>
