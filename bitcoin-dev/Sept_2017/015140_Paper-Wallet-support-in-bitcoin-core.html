    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list addresses concerns about the security of Bitcoin Core wallet, particularly in relation to key generation and storage. The proposal suggests that users should not have control over their keys, and instead, a simple offline module should be created to serve as a "wallet." This module would allow users to conduct transactions offline, check them, and then send them to the network via qt, the web or other means. Although a good idea, the process is complicated and unfinished, requiring users to be somewhat online to make their transactions. The use of paper wallets is deemed insecure due to the possibility of address reuse and the unclear spending procedures, which may compromise the key in question. In addition, the printer buffers pose a serious problem. To improve the security of the system, it is suggested that the dumpprivkey and dumpwallet RPCs be removed from bitcoin-core to fit this paradigm. The proposal also emphasizes the importance of trust, and how the increasing demand for hardware wallets might be attributed to the growing lack of trust in current operating systems and desktop/laptop CPUs. In conclusion, although there are currently no existing solutions to address all the issues, improving the system's security should be a priority.</p>
