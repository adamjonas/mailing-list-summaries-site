    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a discussion was held about preventing "outlier behavior" in mining. Mark Friedenbach suggested that under continuous mempool model assumptions, such behavior would be considered an outlier and could be prevented with a maximum fee rate calculated as a filter over past block rates. However, Daniele Pinna raised a concern that such a scheme could incentivize miners to limit the number of transactions in a block in order to capture the maximum fee and avoid lower fee paying transactions reducing their potential earnings. This could potentially lead to clogging of the network by a single user paying high fees every ten minutes. The debate continued on the mailing list without any clear resolution on how to prevent such behavior.</p>
