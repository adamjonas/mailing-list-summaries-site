    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The BIPs repository often receives pull requests for spelling corrections and similar editorial changes that are obvious to merge. Currently, the process requires Authors of affected BIPs to acknowledge any changes, which is deemed inefficient and unnecessary for such minor revisions. Therefore, Luke suggests modifying BIP 2 to allow editors to merge these kinds of changes without involving the Authors. Although strictly speaking, BIP 2 should not be changed now that it is Active, Luke believes an exception is reasonable for a minor revision. He has prepared a draft PR for BIP 2 with the proposed modification. If anyone opposes this change, they have been requested to speak up within the next month. The draft PR can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/596">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/596</a>.</p>
