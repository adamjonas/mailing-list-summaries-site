    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Electrum approach, Kabuto Samourai suggested expanding the number of version prefixes to eliminate ambiguity. The writer agrees that this would make sense but believes it would be difficult due to current wallets not being able to handle it easily. They suggest using their "xyz" proposal instead which extends the current format with minimal changes to existing software needed. Removing the p2sh ambiguity would require extra safeguards and handling legacy xpub/xprv differently than ypub and zpub which would take much longer to deploy. Additionally, consensus might be difficult to reach as not all developers will agree on its usefulness. Due to the infinity of possible P2SH scripts, removing ambiguity from a master key associated with a P2SH script would never be possible. Therefore, separating P2SH from P2PKH may not have strong benefits.</p>
