    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on address expiration has been limited to wallets and wallet information exchange protocols, and there has been no talk of it becoming part of the protocol. The sender cannot determine whether an address has been used without a complete copy of the blockchain and more indexes than even Bitcoin Core maintains. As a solution, the "sending" feature should offer guidance to request a fresh address from the recipient and allow the receiver of funds to generate an "invoice" that the sender acts on. Additionally, redirects are deemed problematic due to privacy concerns. Ultimately, the burden is on the sender to ensure the correct address is being used, with some self-interest from the receiver.</p>
