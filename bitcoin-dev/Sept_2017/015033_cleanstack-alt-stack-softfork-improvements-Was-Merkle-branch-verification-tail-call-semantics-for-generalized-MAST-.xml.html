    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Luke Dashjr and Johnson Lau discusses issues related to the use of OP_RETURNTRUE with signature aggregation in Bitcoin. Lau explains that OP_RETURNTRUE does not work well with signature aggregation because old nodes terminate at OP_RETURNTRUE, preventing them from collecting (pubkey, message) pairs. He suggests a softfork to transform OP_RETURNTRUE into OP_17 to solve the problem, but this would require more witness space to store the pairs, defeating the purpose of aggregation. Dashjr suggests that signature aggregation should address this issue by verifying the inclusion of keys in the aggregation upfront. They also discuss the idea of creating any opcode with an OP_NOP, such as OP_MULVERIFY, which verifies if the 3rd stack item is the product of the top 2 stack items. This approach seems like a good idea, but requires further discussion on how it could be implemented without taking up more witness space.</p>
