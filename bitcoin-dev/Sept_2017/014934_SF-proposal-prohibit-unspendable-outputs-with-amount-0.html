    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On September 7, 2017, CryptAxe via bitcoin-dev expressed that unspendable outputs with amount=0 are still allowed and hence not an issue. Whereas Jorge Timón via bitcoin-dev stated that the creation of 0-value outputs that are spendable can potentially stay in utxo forever. He also added that requiring at least 1 satoshi per output would be better than the current situation although it wouldn't do much against a spam attack to the utxo. Jorge Timón further questioned if there was any reason or use case to keep allowing spendable outputs with null amounts in them, and if not, he was happy to create a BIP code for this. It is important to note that the pattern used by Felix Weiss' BIP for Confidential Transactions is tidier with 0-value outputs.</p>
