    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email dated January 31st, 2012, Wladimir brought up the issue of forward compatibility with optional fields. The question at hand was how a client should handle fields that it doesn't recognize. Specifically, when should it display an error message and when should it silently accept and ignore extraneous fields? Wladimir felt that unknown URL parameters should be simply ignored, as this is standard practice. He did not believe that this principle should be changed.However, there are cases where it may be important not to ignore certain parameters, such as if they restrict the validity of the request. For example, if an "expires" parameter were added later on, older clients should refuse to comply. In this situation, all parameters that the client does not recognize would need to be refused. As a consequence, all extensions would break for older clients.</p>
