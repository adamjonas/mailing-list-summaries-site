    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 20 is an old URI scheme that has been finalized since late January 2011. However, the version on the wiki armed as BIP 20 has a ton of extraneous crap in its number encoding which is not implemented in Bitcoin-Qt since it was explicitly voted against at the time the spec was being discussed. On Friday, January 27, 2012, Amir Taaki suggested moving it to accepted status or not due to having a re-decision (even if it was accepted last year). Luke-Jr suggested revisiting the URI Scheme for revision and eventually moving BIP 20 to replaced/superceded status after P2SH is deployed. The implementation of drag and drop and recently system URI handling have been added to the waylaying client.</p>
