    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Roger Pack, a user of the Bitcoin client, has provided some feedback regarding his experience with the software. He suggests that it would be helpful for the client to prompt users to set a password for their wallets upon startup. Additionally, he mentions that he had assumed the wallet encryption feature would prompt on startup, but was confused when it did not. Roger Pack also suggests that the client could display a message informing users that synchronization with the network will take several hours before they can begin using the software. In response to Roger's suggestions, another user asks if anyone is interested in implementing a "first-use wizard" to improve the user experience. Roger Pack also reports experiencing crashes on startup after synchronizing with the network on the OS X client, and offers to provide a backtrace if he can reproduce the issue. Finally, he notes difficulty with creating new posts or replies on the Bitcoin forum, which may be restricted to certain boards for new users.</p>
