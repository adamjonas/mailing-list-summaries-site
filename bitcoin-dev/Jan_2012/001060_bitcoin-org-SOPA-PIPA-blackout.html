    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Amir Taaki expresses his opinion that Wikipedia has more need to remain neutral and apolitical than bitcoin, referencing Satoshi's politically charged whitepaper and the genesis block quote. A supporter of Amir agrees, stating that it would be great if bitcoin related websites joined the Blackout in solidarity with the SOPA initiative. The Blackout is viewed as an internet general strike, and ignoring it is equivalent to being a strikebreaker. The supporter declares that all websites under their control will participate in the blackout, even if it means a loss of revenue for one day, as many publishers are shutting down their websites, resulting in increased ad revenues tomorrow.</p>
