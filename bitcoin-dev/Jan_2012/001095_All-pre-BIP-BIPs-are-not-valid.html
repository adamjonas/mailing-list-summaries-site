    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on whether BIP 20 was accepted as final a year ago before the BIP process existed is ongoing. While Luke Dashjr asserts that it was accepted, some disagree and believe that a BIP needs to go through formalized motions in public before becoming accepted. The URI Scheme is an example of a standard that did not go through the proper procedures and has been objected to by at least two implementations. The purpose of a standard is consensus-building, not enforcement from above. Therefore, it is argued that no BIP existed before the BIP process, and new BIPs are always draft status until they meet the conditions specified in BIP 0001. However, there are conflicting views about this issue, and anyone can submit a competing BIP to Luke's BIP 20, similar to what happened with BIP 16 and 17.</p>
