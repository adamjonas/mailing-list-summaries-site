    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Bitcoin users and developers discuss the impact of SOPA and PIPA on Bitcoin. While some argue that these policies do not directly affect Bitcoin, others point out that SOPA contains new requirements for payment networks which may adversely impact Bitcoin services businesses and limit their ability to do business in the US and other places where similar legislation is adopted. The definition of "payment network provider" under SOPA is broad enough that it could potentially classify the Bitcoin system itself as a payment network, meaning that the AG's office could theoretically order miners and mining pools located in the US to not process transactions containing the addresses of targeted infringing sites without due process. Despite differing opinions on the extent of the threat, many in the email thread agree that internet censorship is a threat to Bitcoin, and that it is important to stand up for our rights now or risk facing the consequences. The value of the Bitcoin network comes from its potential connections, and anything that risks imposing new barriers is a threat to us all. While some argue that participating in SOPA/PIPA awareness campaigns would be pointless, others suggest running informative popups to raise awareness.</p>
