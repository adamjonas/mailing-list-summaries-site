        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion took place in January 2012 on the Bitcoin forum regarding whether the US SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (PROTECT IP Act) would affect Bitcoin. While some argued that there was no direct link between the two, others suggested that SOPA contained new requirements for payment networks which could have a negative impact on Bitcoin services businesses and limit their ability to operate in the US or other countries adopting similar legislation. Additionally, the fact that Bitcoin is a global network means that US laws can still affect its ecosystem. The definition of "payment network provider" under SOPA is broad enough to potentially include the Bitcoin system itself. In theory, this could allow the Attorney General's office to order miners and mining pools in the US to not process transactions containing the addresses of targeted infringing sites, without due process. While this interpretation may be extreme, it highlights the potential risks posed by SOPA to Bitcoin. One participant in the discussion argued that the issue of internet censorship was a threat to Bitcoin, and that standing up for one's rights now was essential. The value of a network or economy lies in the number of potential connections it can make, and anything that risks imposing new barriers is a threat to all. While some felt that Bitcoin.org's help in raising awareness of SOPA and PIPA would be small, there was a consensus that it was important to take a stand against these acts.</p>
