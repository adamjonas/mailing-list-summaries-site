    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 29, 2012, Pieter Wuille wrote about the implementation of bitcoin's pull request 787 on Github. Wuille welcomed test reports, comments, constructive criticism, suggestions, and improvements, stating that there was a need for testing and room for improvements. It is also noteworthy that as of yesterday, this implementation became part of the `next' and `next-test' branches. The summary of the latest next/next-test reveals that several items have been accepted and others require attention. The following items have been accepted: 719 coinbaser, 755 explicit_p2sh, 787 sipa/addrman, and 786 sipa/checkkeys. In contrast, some items still need acceptance, such as 570 force_send (557) and 568 rpc_keepalive (threaded_rpc included). Moreover, some items require review, including 457 origin-pull/457/head* (IPv6 JSON-RPC), 565 optimize_FastGetWork, and 691 origin-pull/691/head (temporarily disable "minimize to tray"). Lastly, some items require support, such as 780 checkhashverify, 715 bugfix_client_name, 559 accept_nonstdtxn, 552 base58_liberal_parsing, 553 bugfix_qt_uri_amount_â€¦, and 562 optimize_ToHex.</p>
