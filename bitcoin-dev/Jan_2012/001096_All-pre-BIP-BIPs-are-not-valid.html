    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion about the status of BIP 20, which was assigned as Final over a year ago. Amir Taaki disagrees with the status of BIP 20, stating that it did not go through the formalized motions in public and did not have the consensus building a standard requires. He claims that BIPs are always draft status, and their status changes as specified in BIP 0001. However, Luke Dashjr argues that there was a consensus and multiple implementations for BIP 20 in early 2011, thus making it a Final status. He adds that assigning a number does not give Amir Taaki the authority to demote a preexisting standard. Luke also notes that anyone can submit a competing BIP aimed at superseding BIP 20; however, until that occurs, BIP 20 remains in its current Final status. Despite their disagreement, they both agree that it is best to focus on actual forward progress.</p>
