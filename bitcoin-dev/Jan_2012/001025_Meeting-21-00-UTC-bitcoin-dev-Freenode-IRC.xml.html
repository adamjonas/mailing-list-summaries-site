    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An email was sent out by Amir Taaki announcing a meeting to discuss the new OP_EVAL changes coming to Bitcoin. This email clarifies that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, not 30 minutes ago. The purpose of the meeting is to inform and discuss the upcoming changes in bitcoin. A good summary of past discussions can be found by Justmoon. Amir Taaki hopes that weekly meetings can become a regular platform for projects to harmonize and propose new concepts and algorithms. By having a scheduled regular platform, it will make bitcoin development and the system more accessible. Before the meeting, a wiki page is created for talking points throughout the week. After the meeting, a log of the discussion is posted online, and an accessible summary is typed for the community at large on <a href="http://bitcoinmedia.com/.">http://bitcoinmedia.com/.</a> The meeting is scheduled for Freenode IRC #bitcoin-dev from 21:00 UTC (16:00 New York time) until 22:00. It is expected that the meeting will not go over this hour to avoid off-topic discussions. Additionally, the email contains information on Citrix VDI-in-a-Box, a solution for delivering seamless, secure access to virtual desktops.</p>
