    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum discussion on February 1st, 2012, Bitcoin developers addressed the backward compatibility of BIP 16 and 17, which are both backward compatible enough that people can continue using the old clients with each other, meaning an upgrade is only required to send or receive the new 3-form addresses. Old clients won't create or accept new transaction types but will accept the new block chain as long as a supermajority of miners enforce the new rules. If there was a breaking change to the protocol, such as adding a new transaction type, all users would need to upgrade, and those who don't will see a fork of the chain from before the first new-style transaction. The differences between BIP16/BIP17 were technically obscure, and there was broad consensus among the involved technically minded parties over just about all of it. There is always a different color that the shed could be painted, and depending on how you count, they had considered a good two dozen options in this space. However, BIP16 was the isolated consensus path forward that came out of the discussions about the concerns that BIP12 was too computationally powerful, and at the time, BIP16 became a BIP only Luke was actively objecting to it.</p>
