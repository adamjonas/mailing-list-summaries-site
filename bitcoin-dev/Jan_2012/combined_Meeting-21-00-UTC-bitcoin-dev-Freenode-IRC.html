        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Amir Taaki has sent out an email announcing a meeting to discuss the new OP_EVAL changes coming to Bitcoin. The purpose of the meeting is to prevent fragmentation and ensure harmony among projects by providing a platform for proposing and debating concepts and algorithms. The goal is to have weekly meetings, which will make Bitcoin development and the system more accessible. To facilitate discussions, a wiki page will be created before each meeting where participants can add talking points throughout the week. After the meeting, a log of the discussion will be posted online, and a summary will be typed for the community at large on bitcoinmedia.com.The meeting is scheduled to take place on Freenode IRC #bitcoin-dev from 21:00 to 22:00 UTC (16:00 New York time). It is expected that the meeting will not exceed one hour to avoid off-topic discussions. The hope is that having a regular, scheduled platform will allow for better coordination and collaboration among Bitcoin projects.In addition to the meeting details, the email also mentions Citrix VDI-in-a-Box, which is a solution for delivering seamless and secure access to virtual desktops.</p>
