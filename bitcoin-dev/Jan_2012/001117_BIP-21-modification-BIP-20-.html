    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of a signed URI is designed to protect the consumer against a malicious seller pretending that he has not been paid. However, it may not work as an attacker can successfully replace it to match their own fraudulent address if they have complete control over the URI content. The bitcoin address used to sign URIs will establish the online reputation of the merchant and prove if they have received payment or not. Using HTTPS signatures for this purpose has disadvantages such as not always being available, needing to distinguish the identity of the merchant from the identity of the website, and requiring users to save receipts manually. The MultiBit team would like to add an "expires" field in the BIP 21 proposal containing an ISO8601 formatted date/time in UTC to allow merchants to issue Bitcoin URIs that expose them to a currency/inventory risk for a defined period of time. This proposal can be found at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=60828.0;topicseen">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=60828.0;topicseen</a>.</p>
