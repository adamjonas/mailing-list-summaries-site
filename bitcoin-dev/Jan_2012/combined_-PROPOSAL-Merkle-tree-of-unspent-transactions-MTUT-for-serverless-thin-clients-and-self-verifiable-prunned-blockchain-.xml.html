        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Alberto Torres Ruiz, also known as DiThi, has proposed a solution to add a hash-tree based check in the blockchain. This would allow for verification of unspent transactions without the need to download and check the entire blockchain. Although the idea is not new, there is currently no technical description available on how this can be achieved. The proposal aims to make the process of verifying unspent transactions more efficient and feasible, while still ensuring consistency and verifiability. Satoshi's original paper had described pruning spent transactions to save storage space, but it is not useful for partial blockchain downloads as it does not indicate if a transaction has been spent in a subsequent transaction.
