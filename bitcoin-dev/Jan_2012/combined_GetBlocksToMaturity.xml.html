        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2012, Amir Taaki sent an email to the Bitcoin development mailing list questioning why there was a 20 confirmations addition to COINBASE_MATURITY. The protocol accepts spent transactions at 100 (COINBASE_MATURITY), so adding 20 more confirms seems like a measure to discourage people from spending until 120 confirms. Taaki suggests that if someone were determined enough to hack their client, they could still spend before 120 confirms, but after 100. It is possible that Satoshi overestimated the number of competing races between mined blocks, leading to the implementation of this measure.Taaki speculates that the reason for adding 20 confirmations is likely to ensure that transactions are accepted by the network when sent out and to prevent potential network partitions causing another fork to get built up. At around 20 confirmations, one can be sure that the rest of the network also has 100 confirmations off the original mined block. On the other hand, at 100 confirms, there may be a chain ahead of everyone else or a temporary network partition (islanding) that causes another fork to get built up, leading to not everyone having 100 confirms.The speculation arises as to whether or not Satoshi overestimated how many competing races there would be between mined blocks. Although if one is determined enough to hack their client, they can still spend before 120 but after 100.</p>
