    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the use of satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin as a better choice. The discussion is in regards to BIP 20, which lacks support among implementations such as Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum, MultiBit, and Bitcoin-JS. Bitcoin-Qt has the majority of users, but Amir Taaki discourages using this line of reasoning. Instead of rejecting BIP 21, which is largely a copy-paste of BIP 20 with some sections removed and still a draft, they should agree on something to run by BlueMatt and make it the new BIP 21. There is consensus forming on most parts, but the send private key is contentious, and there's a topic of adding a time to expire field for merchants, which is a good idea, according to Amir Taaki. BIP 20 is problematic because it is incompatible with almost every standard on the web. It uses decimal numbers alone while all the HTML, URI, and everything else uses decimal numbers. Breaking from tradition doesn't seem necessary, especially since it would cause confusion. Amir Taaki also mentions that although he dies a little inside every time he has to write color or vectorize in his code as a British speaker, it's convention and American English is international English. The world isn't perfect, and we live in a decimal-counting English-speaking Windows-using God-worshipping world, but there's no offense intended towards them.</p>
