    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Pieter has released v0.1.0 of his bitcoin-seeder program on Github. This program powers the DNS seed on seed.bitcoin.sipa.be and is a crawler for the bitcoin network, with an integrated DNS server. The program has minimal functionality at this point. Some missing features include logging, some configuration options, and daemonization. The program has been running without any issues on Pieter's node for over a week, so he decided to release it. He welcomes comments and questions from users. The program regularly dumps its database in dnsseed.dat, allowing fast reinitialization. However, as the program is far from finished, Pieter does not guarantee that the file format will remain compatible with future versions.</p>
