    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was held on the Bitcoin mailing list about the implementation of BIP 20, which is a proposal for a uniform payment protocol. The original poster stated that BIP 20 had been implemented in many Bitcoin clients since 2011 and had only recently been added to Bitcoin-Qt for system URI handling. Another participant in the discussion disagreed, stating that the version of BIP 20 on the wiki contained extraneous information and was not implemented in Bitcoin-Qt due to a vote against it during the specification process. The original poster responded by saying that the vote had occurred three months after the spec had a consensus and multiple implementations. They also accused the other participant of losing a biased poll and claimed that no sites had links to their version of BIP 20.</p>
