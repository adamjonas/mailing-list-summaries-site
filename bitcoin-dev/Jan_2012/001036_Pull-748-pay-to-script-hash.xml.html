    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on January 7, 2012, Gavin Andresen and Pieter discussed the compressed-public-keys patch. Pieter mentioned that he had added some unit tests but Gavin was unsure if the patch had been pulled. They went on to discuss how compressed public keys interact with pay-to-script-hash to make ECDSA denial-of-service attacks less expensive and how transaction fees need to be reconsidered before releasing version 0.6. They suggested tweaking the fee policy so that denial-of-service attacks using compressed public keys and 1-of-3 CHECKMULTISIG transactions are expensive enough to deter attackers. Compressed public keys are smaller and more CPU intensive to verify than regular public keys.</p>
