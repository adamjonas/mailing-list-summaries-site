    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BIP 0020, which is the old URI scheme BIPisized, is currently in Draft status. It is not clear whether it should be moved to Accepted status or not, since there was a discussion last year that the speaker does not have enough information about. However, the speaker feels that having a re-decision on the matter, even if it was accepted last year, is healthy since it is important to have a standardization process before having a standard. As of now, BIP 0020 remains in Draft status until there is a general agreement.</p>
