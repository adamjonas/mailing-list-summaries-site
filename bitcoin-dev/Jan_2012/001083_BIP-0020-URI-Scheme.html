    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post dated January 28, 2012, Luke-Jr noted that the implementation of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21, which allowed users to send bitcoins using a human-readable address instead of a cryptographic one, had already been implemented in many clients throughout 2011. He also mentioned that Bitcoin-Qt was lagging behind and considered it not relevant. However, Bitcoin Wallet for Android only implemented parts of this specification, leaving out the hexadecimal and exponent notations due to their redundancy. The "label" and "message" parameters were also absent but could potentially be included in later versions. Lastly, the "send" feature was not yet implemented.</p>
