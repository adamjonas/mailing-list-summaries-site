        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Developer Pavol Rusnak has praised the use of Protocol Buffers in Trezor, despite the risk of adding an exotic dependency to a software project. He argues that Protocol Buffers are easy to work with and have many interoperable implementations in various languages. However, there are discussions about whether people are moving away from Protocol Buffers in favor of FlatBuffers. Another developer named Will suggests providing custom format to protobuf conversion tools, allowing users who prefer not to include large dependencies to convert it into their preferred format.On 15/02/2019, Luke Dashjr discussed the proposed proof-file format, which aims to provide a standard way to combine multiple proofs and associated metadata. The specification for this format is in Protocol Buffers. Despite some concerns about using Protocol Buffers, Pavol "stick" Rusnak believes that it is not risky because of its interoperable implementations in all possible languages and its ease of use. He compares it to the PSBT format, which was almost as complex as protobuf but proprietary to Bitcoin, hindering adoption. He believes that if Protocol Buffers had been used since the beginning, there would have been much more usage of the PSBT format already. Overall, Protocol Buffers have proven to be a successful choice for Trezor.</p>
