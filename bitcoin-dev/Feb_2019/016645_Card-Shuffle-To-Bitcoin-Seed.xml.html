    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal is to create a deterministic Bitcoin wallet by shuffling a physical deck of cards. This will add an extra layer of security for hardware and air-gapped wallets as it eliminates the need to trust seed generation from the wallet provider. 52! different shuffle orders can be created, which makes it difficult to brute force or have collisions. This shuffled deck of cards can also serve as a physical backup that is easy to hide with plausible deniability. The deck of cards is represented by SCHD (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds) and values of 23456789TJQKA. Step 1 is to shuffle the deck at least 7 times with no biasing. Step 2 is to write out the order comma-separated. Step 3 is to SHA512 it to create a seed. And step 4 is to interpret it, for example, treat the first 32 bytes as the private key and the second 32 bytes as the extension code for BIP32.</p>
