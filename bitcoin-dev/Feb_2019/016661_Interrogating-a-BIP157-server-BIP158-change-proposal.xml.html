    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on February 6, 2019, Tamas Blummer expressed skepticism that commitment of any filter will come into Core soon. He suggested that a committed filter would make light clients more reliable and attractive. In response, an unnamed individual accused Blummer of repeatedly smearing the idea of a committed filter. The individual argued that there was significant interest from bitcoin developers to eventually commit an output filter, and that there had been a significant investment of effort in improving the proposal to that end. They went on to criticize Blummer for not investing enough time to read their words before making negative assumptions about their wishes.</p>
