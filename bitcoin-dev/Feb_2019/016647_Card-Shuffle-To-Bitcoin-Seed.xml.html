    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed bring-your-own-entropy approach for Bitcoin wallets has been put forth. The idea is that users can function completely deterministically, without having to trust seed generation. The method involves shuffling a physical deck of cards, which provides enough space to be secure against collision and brute force attacks, with 52! (2^219.88) different shuffle orders. A shuffled deck of cards can also serve as a physical backup which is easy to hide in plain sight, providing great plausible deniability. Each card has a suit represented by one of SCHD and a value of one of 23456789TJQKA. Users must shuffle their deck of cards at least seven times to achieve true cryptographic security, and write out the order in comma-separated format. Finally, they sha512 it to create a seed, which can be interpreted based on the specific use case.</p>
