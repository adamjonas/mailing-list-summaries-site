    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Devrandom, James MacWhyte and Ryan Havar via the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Devrandom suggested using 50+ 6-sided dice rolls to generate about 128 bits of entropy for security purposes. However, Alan Evans pointed out that simply using SHA512 is not enough as it requires an additional condition -- if IL is 0 or â‰¥n, the master key is invalid. Additionally, he questioned how this would be used to seed a hardware wallet that requires a BIP39 seed, suggesting that a scheme that takes Cards -> Entropy may be more appropriate. He referenced Ian Coleman's BIP39 site which already supports cards and dice with various capabilities such as detecting "full deck", calculating total bits of entropy, card replacement and multiple decks. Finally, Evans corrected Devrandom's claim that dice rolls would provide 219 bits of entropy, stating that log2(52!) ~= 225.58 bits.</p>
