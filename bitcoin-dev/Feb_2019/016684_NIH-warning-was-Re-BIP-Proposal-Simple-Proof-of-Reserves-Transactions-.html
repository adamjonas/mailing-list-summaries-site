    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 15/02/2019, Luke Dashjr discussed the proposed proof-file format which provides a standard way to combine multiple proofs and associated metadata. The specification of the format is in Protocol Buffers. However, Pavol "stick" Rusnak expressed his opinion that using Protocol Buffers in software projects is not risky because it has many interoperable implementations in all possible languages and is easy to work with. He compared it to the PSBT format which was almost as complex as protobuf, but proprietary to Bitcoin, hindering adoption. He believes that had PB been used since the beginning, there would have been much more PSBT usage already.</p>
