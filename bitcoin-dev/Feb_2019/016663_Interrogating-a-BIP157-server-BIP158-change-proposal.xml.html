    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tamas Blummer responded to Gregory Maxwell, stating that he did not assume ill intent on the contributors of the proposal. He explained his concerns about potential opposition and preferred an uncommitted filter for now. Blummer expressed his personal evaluation that commitment was not yet to build on and highlighted the lack of consensus on how any future soft fork would be activated. He also mentioned making assumptions on the timeline of dependencies while trying to build useful software. Blummer learned new arguments from the discussion, including atomic swaps by Laolu. Lastly, he stated that it appeared that Maxwell was assuming ill intent on his side, which hurt him as he had contributed to the ecosystem for many years without hurting the project. The context also includes a response from Maxwell, where he apologized if he had offended Blummer but asked for clarification on what was seen as an attack.</p>
