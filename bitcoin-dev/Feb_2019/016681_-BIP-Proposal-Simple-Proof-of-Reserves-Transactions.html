    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On the Bitcoin-developer mailing list, there was a discussion around a proposed proof format that provides a standard way of combining multiple proofs and associated metadata. The format is specified in the Protocol Buffers format. The proposed format is designed to make proofs easily verifiable even after some of the UTXOs used in the proof are no longer unspent. However, one participant raised concerns about the content of the format, noting that it may hinder adoption due to previous controversy surrounding its use in BIP70. Another participant pointed out that the format lacks sufficient information and suggested the addition of a merkle proof. Finally, someone noted that although this transaction is invalid, nodes cannot prove it, and if sent, they will likely cache the "transaction," taking up memory.</p>
