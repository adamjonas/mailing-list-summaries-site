    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Address reuse prevention is a matter of social agreement between the payer and payee as it cannot be banned at the protocol level. While NOINPUT is compatible with eltoo, implementing a nanny in the protocol is inappropriate and limiting for developers who want features. Johnson Lau suggests that publishing the key after a coin is confirmed is a much stronger way to prevent address reuse. Luke Dashjr points out that such a wallet would never show a second payment to the same address confirmed until it is spent successfully. It is not possible to indicate this requirement in current Bitcoin L1 addresses using tx versions, and the purpose of encoding scriptPubKey isn't clear. Therefore, if people don't want to use NOINPUT, they should just not use it.</p>
