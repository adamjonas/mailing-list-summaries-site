    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion about a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to signature formats when using Bitcoin private keys. Christopher Gilliard wrote up the proposal and shared it with the community for feedback. The proposal includes code for verification, but not for signing, which Aymeric Vitte suggests should be added with a more precise description of the signing/verification process since it is currently undocumented. Gilliard explains that he implemented the proposal after reading a post and found the formatMessageForSigning to be trivial but in need of better documentation. Vitte questions the purpose of the header and the link between keys and signatures, suggesting that the header seems completely unnecessary, particularly when extending to segwit/bech32. Gilliard responds that the reason for including data in the header is similar to why compressed/uncompressed is included: to know which type of key the signature is from and avoid trying all options. While there may be other ways to do this, Gilliard thought it useful to document the method being used. Gilliard's BIP proposal is inline with the implementation that Trezor has already implemented, and any feedback on the proposal is appreciated. Gilliard asks for steps to get a BIP number assigned or any other required process steps. The context also includes links to various Bitcoin-related projects, wallets, and tools created by Aymeric Vitte.</p>
