    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal to implement Confidential Transactions (CT) in extension blocks is being discussed as a possible solution for various concerns. CT transactions will pass through normal blocks and go from one extension block to another. This approach can be implemented via a soft fork, which will allow old nodes to see CT transactions as "sendtoany" transactions. The system is secure, as it is impossible to create new coins even if there is a software bug in the CT process. Public transactions can be used by exchanges, making the system legal and transparent. Regulators can easily monitor the activity of exchanges. The maximum number of transactions per block can increase with the implementation of CT. The CT signature is stored in the extension block, which increases the capacity of the block. Overall, the implementation of CT in extension blocks seems like an ideal solution to address various concerns related to transaction security, transparency, and capacity.</p>
