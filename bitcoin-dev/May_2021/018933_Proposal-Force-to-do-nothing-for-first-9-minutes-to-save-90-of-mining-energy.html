    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Michael Fuhrmann posed a question regarding why miners need to mine for the 9 minutes after the last block was found in order to prevent "pre-mining" during that time window. He suggested two possible solutions for discussion: implementing a global network timer sending a salted hash time code after 9 minutes or increasing the difficulty of mining jobs before 9 minutes have passed. He acknowledged there may be other problems behind these ideas, but if a working solution can be found, it could help address concerns about energy usage without compromising the robustness of the Bitcoin network. Pavol Rusnak, co-founder and CTO of SatoshiLabs, also chimed in on the thread, encouraging readers to read the Bitcoin whitepaper as it is an interesting read.</p>
