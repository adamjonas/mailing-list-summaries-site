    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between R E Broadley and Karl via bitcoin-dev, the latter suggested that reducing the block reward in Bitcoin would help improve its mainstream public reputation and reduce energy expenditure. However, Broadley pointed out that the block reward is already being reduced by 50% every four years. Karl then mentioned "block reward termination" in his next paragraph, but it is unclear whether Broadley received the rest of his message. The context also includes an HTML attachment that was scrubbed from the email.</p>
