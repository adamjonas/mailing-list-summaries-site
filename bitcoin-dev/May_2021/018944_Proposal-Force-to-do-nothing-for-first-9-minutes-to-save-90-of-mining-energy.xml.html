    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are companies, such as Bitmain, that can produce their own ASICs and mining rigs to mine with. Bitmain controls Antpool, which holds a significant amount of the hash power. The cost of producing an additional mining rig is low compared to the costs of research and development and setting up production lines. However, there were other remarks in the email that were confusing and disregarded by the sender. This information was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</p>
