        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1 has been released with bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker and subscribe to security and update notifications. Compatibility is not recommended on unsupported systems, and macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Notable changes include the mainnet and testnet activation parameters for the taproot soft fork (BIP341), schnorr signatures (BIP340), and tapscript (BIP342). These improvements will allow users of single-signature scripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use identical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the fungibility of all bitcoins.Activation for taproot is being managed using a variation of BIP9 versionbits called Speedy Trial. Taproot's version bit is bit 2, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal support for taproot at the beginning of the first retarget period after taprootâ€™s start date of 24 April 2021. If 90% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period signal support for taproot prior to the first retarget period beginning after the time of 11 August 2021, the soft fork will be locked in, and taproot will then be active as of block 709632 (expected in early or mid November).The Bitcoin Core team also included an update to the consensus rules for speedy trial activation of Taproot. This release includes changes to allow CSubNet of non-IP networks and a Bech32m encoding requirement for addresses, following the implementation of BIP 350. Updated RPCs are included in this release as well.All users, businesses, and miners are encouraged to upgrade to this release (or a subsequent compatible release) unless they object to activation of taproot. Users can access numerous resources for more information about Taproot, including technical specifications, popular articles, development history overviews, and questions/answers. The changelog lists all updates and credits those who contributed to the release.</p>
