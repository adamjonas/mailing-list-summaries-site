    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The direction of Bitcoin development should not be solely determined by those funding it as they may have their own opinions, influence and disagreements. While a position in a futures market represents a prediction about the possible outcomes of an event, it is not equivalent to funding Bitcoin development. Bitcoin developers often have a significant stake in Bitcoin and changes in its price can greatly affect their life savings. A position in a futures market can represent an implicit threat to "fund" or "de-fund" developers based on the direction of development. However, it's important to consider that futures markets may not reflect all available information. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account different factors when considering the direction of Bitcoin development.</p>
