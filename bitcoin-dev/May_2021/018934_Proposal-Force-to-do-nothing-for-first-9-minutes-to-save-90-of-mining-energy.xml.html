    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to Bitcoin-dev, Michael Fuhrmann proposed the idea of not mining for the first 9 minutes after a block is found. However, another member, Rene, responded saying that this would decrease the security of the network as less work protects previously mined blocks. Additionally, it would be impossible to sync clocks in a distributed network, which is necessary for such a system. Even if these issues were resolved, there would still be the problem of preventing miners from computing the simpler difficulty problem directly after the block was found and publishing their solution after minute 9. Thus, while the idea may be appreciated, it seems impractical. Michael's proposal aimed to prevent pre-mining in the 9-minute time window by using a global network timer or by increasing the difficulty before 9 minutes. He believes that finding a working solution could end the energy fud without losing robustness.</p>
