    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The distributed algorithm of Bitcoin can be changed to make previously valid transactions invalid without creating any lasting chain splits. This is proposed for the addition of the eval opcode by using one of the existing NOPs. However, if an invalid transaction is emitted after the block height that the rule is coded to take effect and a super-majority of miners are not yet upgraded, it may cause a long reorganization and serious disruption. To avoid this, nodes are upgraded with certain rules. They should never forward or mine a transaction that would be invalid under the new rule and apply old behavior before height X unconditionally. After the first point in the chain after X when none of the last Y blocks have contained an invalid transaction under the new rules, they begin applying the new rule.After releasing the software, members of the Bitcoin community intentionally transmit transactions that are invalid under the new rules. By setting Y high enough, all major miners have a chance to mine in the window, making it an effective vote for the change by miners with a stochastic super-majority threshold. The new encoding will only become active when enough mining capacity supports it so that a large reorganization will not happen due to incompatible blocks during deployment.This could be further enhanced with conflicting block discouragement, but the proposed scheme is sufficient without that. Another safeguard can be added before applying the new rule, requiring 50% of the last Y blocks to contain a coinbase with an "I am upgraded" code. Until the new rule is active, an "I am upgraded" code is included in every block which can be turned off once the rule is active. The active statement provides a proof of how likely a fork of length X will be if a newly invalid transaction is announced at the time of activation.</p>
