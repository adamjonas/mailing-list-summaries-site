    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The distributed algorithm can be altered without creating any lasting chain splits by making previously valid transactions invalid. This proposal has been made for the addition of the eval opcode by using one of the existing NOPs. However, if upgraded nodes emit invalid transactions under the new scheme, but valid under the old, after the block height and super-majority of miners are not yet upgraded, it may cause a long reorganization and serious disruption.To avoid this, upgraded nodes must follow certain rules, such as never forwarding or mining a transaction that would be invalid under the new rule. The old behavior is applied unconditionally before height X, which is set far enough in the future to get reasonable deployment by large miners. The new rule is applied only after the first point in the chain after X when none of the last Y blocks have contained an invalid transaction under the new rules.After the software has been released, members of the Bitcoin community intentionally transmit transactions that are invalid under the new rules. By setting Y high enough that all major miners have a chance to mine in the window, this becomes an effective vote for the change by miners with a stochastic super-majority threshold. The new encoding will only become active when enough mining capacity supports it so that a large reorganization will not happen due to incompatible blocks during deployment.Luke-Jr suggested a safeguard where an "I am upgraded" code is included in every block until the new rule is active, and 50% of the last Y blocks contain a coinbase with the same code before applying the new rule. This statement constitutes a proof, indicating how likely a fork of length X will be if a newly invalid transaction is announced at the time of activation.</p>
