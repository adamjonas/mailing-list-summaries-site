    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on October 5, 2011, Michael Gr√∏nager raised a concern about the vtxPrev storing transactions that are three blocks back. He questioned whether it was necessary for transactions to mature for seven blocks before they can be considered respendable, citing the unlikelihood of a transaction becoming invalid after seven confirmations. However, it was clarified that transactions do not need to mature for seven blocks before they become respendable. The software attempts to use older inputs when available, but if not, it will use what it has. The system also trusts its own transactions and is prone to respending its own outputs quickly. There is a possibility of deep splits where inputs may have been spent differently in a new split. While it is not especially likely, retransmitting one of your own txn's parents if it's dropped but not yet impossible seems prudent.</p>
