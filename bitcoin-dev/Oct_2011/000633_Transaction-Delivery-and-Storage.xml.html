    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on October 5, 2011, Brian McQueen asked about the creation, storage, and transmission of bitcoin transactions. He also inquired about how these transactions would be reintroduced into the peer-to-peer (P2P) network once they were outside it. The response was that the P2P network is not essential to bitcoin and that with patches, transactions can be imported and exported to text from a regular client. The distributed algorithm and block chain are more important to bitcoin than the P2P network. It was even suggested that all bitcoin systems could be interconnected with Morse code operators running spark gap transmitters without any IP packets, and it would still be bitcoin.</p>
