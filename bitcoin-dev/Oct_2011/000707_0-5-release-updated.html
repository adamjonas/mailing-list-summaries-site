    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The final 0.5 release of Bitcoin has not been released yet due to the developer's paranoia about Bitcoin binary builds and the recent switch to Qt, which means a change in the way the builds are done. Linux builds are all set with the Gitian trusted build process working nicely. However, Windows builds have been difficult, and a GCC expert is needed to help debug the Gitian cross-compile. The lack of support for compiling bitcoin-qt/bitcoind with Visual Studio may result in removing src/makefile.vc and only supporting the MinGW toolchain. For Mac builds, the 0.4 release was slightly broken, but the developer hopes to fix it soon by recompiling the world and making sure that Mac binaries are available soon. Anyone who can help test, especially those with 32-bit Intel Mac running 10.5, is welcome. Additionally, the developer wishes to have a .pro file to compile bitcoind, as maintaining multiple makefiles is time-consuming and error-prone.</p>
