    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from October 24, 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed the implementation of green addresses as a second signature in scriptSig, which would require hacking the bitcoin client. This would allow for transactions with the input of a green address to be ignored by old clients but still considered standard, and for bitcoin to search for signatures in wallet transactions. Jan responded to this proposal, stating that he had experimented with generating such transactions but ran into the issue that IsStandard() also checks that the size of scriptSig is not above 200. The addition of an extra signature triggered this limit, and it seems there is no way around it.</p>
