    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on October 3, 2011, Luke-Jr suggested two potential safeguards for a new rule being implemented. The first safeguard, option (3), would require that before applying the new rule, 50% of the last Y blocks contain a coinbase with an "I am upgraded" code. Option (4) proposed adding an "I am upgraded" code in every block until the new rule is active and then turning it off afterwards. The second option was positively received, but the first option was not as desirable because it assumes that 95% of the network is neutral regarding the change, since they will not mine either form of the transactions. However, the active statement in the second option has added benefits since it serves as proof in determining the likelihood of a fork of length X if a newly invalid transaction is announced during activation, based on the window size.</p>
