    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email correspondence, Gregory Maxwell and Gavin Andresen are discussing the proposed use of OP_EVAL as an optional tool for multi-signature transactions. Maxwell suggests that it's already possible to create an infinite series of secondary keys from a disclosed public key, which only the owner can decode. He argues that the subscripts/mappings required for OP_EVAL scripts are just as important as regular private keys and should be kept in the wallet forever, although they don't have to be encrypted. The discussion also touches on the need for a button on the main client that allows users to easily add an OP_EVAL script/mapping to their wallet. However, there is concern about user error and the potential consequences of not performing regular maintenance tasks. It is noted that if failure to perform such tasks results in losing money or breaking the client, this usage paradigm should be avoided.</p>
