    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On October 10, 2011, Gavin Andresen wrote that he had just tagged the git tree "v0.5.0rc1" and requested users to compile and help test it. A user on Debian compiled the code without any issues and tested the encryption of their wallet successfully. The update included a change from wxWidgets for the GUI to Qt, which was done because there were no wxWidgets programmers contributing fixes or improvements. The new GUI was more stylish than the previous one and the user liked the notifications and the system tray icon on the status bar. Overall, the user appreciated the good work.</p>
