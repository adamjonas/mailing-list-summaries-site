    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A suggestion was made to implement Green addresses as a second signature in scriptSig. The idea is that trust aggregators would sign transactions for merchants like MtGox, who would then export and upload them to the authority. This approach would avoid the need for the trust aggregator to be consulted for each transaction. Checking for revocation would still be essential, but the CA cert could state what kind of guarantee is available. The demand for IT networking professionals continues to grow, and the demand for specialized networking skills is growing even more rapidly.</p>
