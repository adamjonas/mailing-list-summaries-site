    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke-Jr, a Bitcoin developer and operator of the mining pool Eligius, announced on October 9, 2011 that he would no longer be using bitcoind for Eligius soon. The reason behind this decision was not specified in the email thread. When asked what he would be using instead, Luke-Jr did not provide an answer. It was also questioned whether bitcoind was a requirement for running a mining pool. Bitcoind is a full node implementation of the Bitcoin protocol that allows users to interact with the Bitcoin network. While it is commonly used by miners to connect their mining hardware to the network, it is not strictly necessary to run a mining pool. However, most mining pools do utilize bitcoind or another similar software. The email thread included multiple responses from other members of the Bitcoin community, offering suggestions for alternative software to use in place of bitcoind. Some of the alternatives mentioned were CGMiner, BFGMiner, and DiabloMiner. Despite the discussion surrounding the switch away from bitcoind, Eligius continued to operate as a mining pool until its closure in May 2017.</p>
