    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are several branches available for peer review that are not yet ready to be merged into the mainline. These branches include features such as accepting non-standard transactions, relaying transactions regardless of fees, optimizing various functions within the code, and supporting HTTP 1.1 keep-alive. One branch, my_free_txn, would accept a user's own transactions regardless of fees or standardness and put credits-to-user toward covering required fees. Another branch, accept_nonstdtxn, adds an option for miners to easily accept "non-standard" transactions. This branch may need to be amended with a block for OP_NOP*. Optimizations in other branches include caching RPC username and password, caching AdjustedTime around a for loop, using faster binary-to-hexadecimal-string functions, and faster base64 decoding. There is also an optimization to remove a 2 second delay from CheckWork, which is not necessary for most pools. Another optimization branch is threaded_rpc, which uses a new thread for each JSON-RPC connection with mutexes preventing actual methods from being executed concurrently (except for parts of getwork). This branch was tested on Eligius from day one, under older versions, and has been merged with some of JoelKatz's patch making it stable with SSL support.Lastly, there is a branch for supporting HTTP 1.1 keep-alive, which depends on threaded_rpc. While these branches are not yet ready for merging into the mainline, they are open for peer review and can be viewed at <a href="http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/w/bitcoind/luke-jr.git/heads">http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/w/bitcoind/luke-jr.git/heads</a>.</p>
