        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The speaker envisions the automation of the contracts page using specialized software that interacts directly with the Bitcoin network. This would allow for transactions to be moved by clients performing HTTP POSTs of protocol buffers to servers that can interpret the received messages. In an email exchange in 2011, Brian McQueen asked about the creation, storage, and transmission of bitcoin transactions. He also questioned how these transactions would be reintroduced into the peer-to-peer (P2P) network once they were outside it. The response was that the P2P network is not essential to bitcoin and that transactions can be imported and exported to text from a regular client with patches. It was even suggested that all bitcoin systems could be interconnected with Morse code operators running spark gap transmitters without any IP packets and still function as bitcoin.The Contracts wiki page discusses the creation, storage, and transmission of transactions in a P2P network. Transactions are passed around outside the P2P network and are not immediately broadcasted. The page raises questions about how these transactions will be brought back into the P2P network once they are out. The context emphasizes the need to understand the transaction handling process and calls for further exploration on the topic.Additionally, the context provides a link to Kiva.org, a website focused on making a big difference through small loans.</p>
