    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In October 2011, Luke-Jr requested that Coinbaser be merged for the 0.5 version of Bitcoind. He stated that it had undergone extensive testing on Eligius for months, and there was a lot of support for the new JSON-RPC method as requested. Luke-Jr had even documented the process. However, Gavin's response on IRC was that he was unwilling to merge it despite its readiness, testing, and fulfillment of his original request for community support for the new JSON-RPC call. This occurred before the feature freeze on version 0.5, and Luke-Jr hopes that it will get merged to the 0.6 git before requiring a rebase.</p>
