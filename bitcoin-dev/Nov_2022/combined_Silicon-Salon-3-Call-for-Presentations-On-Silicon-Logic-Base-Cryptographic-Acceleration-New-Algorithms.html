        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Blockchain Commons is organizing Silicon Salon 3 in mid-January. The event aims to bring together digital wallet developers, semiconductor manufacturers, and academics. The salon will feature presentations focused on silicon-logic-based cryptographic acceleration or support for new functionality such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) leveraging hardened semiconductor-based security. The goal of this event is to bridge the gap between wallet requirements and semiconductor development and academic research and real-world practice. Some of the presentations lined up for the salon include "In pursuit of an open Secure Element" and "Architectural considerations in creating a semiconductor for the future of MPC." Proposals for presentations are being accepted until December 23, and final slide decks are due by January 16. The event is tentatively scheduled for January 18, with a finalized date to be announced soon. The salon is made possible by sponsors Bitmark, Chia, Cramium Labs, Foundation, Proxy, and Unchained Capitol. Additional sponsors are welcome to contact Blockchain Commons.</p>
