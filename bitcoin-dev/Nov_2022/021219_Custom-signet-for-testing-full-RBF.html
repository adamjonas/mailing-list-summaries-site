    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email to Bitcoin developers, a user named Michael Folkson expressed his interest in custom signet setup and raised questions regarding the purpose of using a custom signet. The email was in response to another user's post about setting up a custom signet for testing full RBF. Michael asked what could be tested on a custom signet that can't be tested on the default signet with Bitcoin Core 24.0 and if there are any difficulties in setting up a custom signet. He also enquired whether it is safe to run a custom signet node on the same machine as a default signet, mainnet or testnet full node. In addition to this, he expressed interest in knowing how regularly the sole block signer on the custom signet is mining blocks. The original post by alicexbt was about setting up a custom signet for testing full RBF and sharing details of the nodes where other users can connect to test. She shares an example configuration and a simple test case for testing the custom signet. She suggests that it will be fun to test with more nodes joining the custom signet and even set up an explorer if the experiment makes sense.</p>
