    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has launched a full-replace-by-fee (RBF) bounty program for miners to reward them for turning on full-RBF. He is broadcasting replacements paying high fees to incentivize miners to participate in the transition of Bitcoin to a more secure mempool policy based on economic incentives rather than trust. The profit margins for miners and pools are pretty small, making it easier to make a difference. If you want to participate, you can use mempoolfullrbf=1 option in the upcoming Bitcoin Core v24 release or modify the code by removing the opt-in RBF check. After enabling full-RBF, you need a full-RBF peer, which can be found on nodes like cup.nop.lol, mug.nop.lol, jar.nop.lol, and jug.nop.lol. Peter is running these nodes and they run a preferential peering patch to connect full-RBF nodes to each other and to propagate replacements easily. If you would like to donate to this effort, you can send BTC to bc1qagmufdn6rf80kj3faw4d0pnhxyr47sevp3nj9m. Peter is aware that miners could collect this bounty in other ways, such as raising minimum fees, but he is not too concerned about it since it also breaks zeroconf.</p>
