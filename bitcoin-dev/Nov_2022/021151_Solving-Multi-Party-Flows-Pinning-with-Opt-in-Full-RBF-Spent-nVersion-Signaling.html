    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation discusses the impact of rule #3 and rule #5 on coinjoin scenarios. Even with fullrbf-everywhere and V3, pinning via these rules can be an issue. Double-spending counterparties can cause pain per peer, and violating rule #5 is contained to coinjoins with around 50 peers. However, there's no hard technical reason for rule #5 to exist, and it's simply a conservative DoS limit. It's important to note that exploiting these rules costs money, and while we shouldn't assume they will always exist, they do impact things today. The attacker pays more at stake in this case and can be booted from the protocol whenever they get mined, assuming they pay the price and get mined.</p>
