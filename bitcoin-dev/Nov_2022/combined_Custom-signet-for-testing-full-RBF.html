        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user named Alicexbt has successfully set up a custom signet for testing full Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and is inviting Bitcoin Developers to participate. The purpose of using a custom signet, as mentioned by another user named Michael Folkson in an email to the developers, is to test features that may not be available on the default signet with Bitcoin Core 24.0. Michael raised questions about the difficulties in setting up a custom signet and whether it is safe to run it on the same machine as other signets. He also expressed interest in knowing how regularly the sole block signer on the custom signet is mining blocks.Alicexbt had no issues setting up the custom signet using instructions from the Bitcoin wiki. They are the sole block signer and have been mining blocks regularly with default settings. While mainstream miners and dictators did not respond or agree to use full RBF, Alicexbt believes testing is important and encourages others to join the experiment. To connect to the custom signet nodes, users can use the `addnode` command with the provided IP address or connect through i2p or onion nodes. Alicexbt has shared an example configuration and a simple test case where two nodes are connected, and Tx1 is broadcasted using one node and replaced with Tx2 using the `bumpfee` RPC on the other node. Those interested in testing can post their Bitcoin addresses in the "full-rbf room". Alicexbt suggests that if the experiment proves successful, they may proceed towards setting up an explorer. The email sent by Alicexbt to Bitcoin developers was done using Proton Mail secure email service.</p>
