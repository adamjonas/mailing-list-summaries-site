    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, has launched a full-RBF bounty program for miners. He will broadcast full-RBF replacements that pay extremely high fees to reward miners who turn on full-RBF. The amount starts small, at around $100 per block during times of congestion. By doing this, he wants to encourage miners to adopt the full RBF policy. Businesses that accept 0conf will have to adjust their risk accordingly and, as a result, misaligned incentives will be resolved. Todd argues that non-mining users' actions are not as important as miners consistently mining "full RBF." To join the program, miners can use the mempoolfullrbf=1 option in the upcoming Bitcoin Core v24 release or the mempoolreplacement=fee option in Bitcoin Knots. Alternatively, they can remove the opt-in RBF check themselves. Todd is running some full-RBF peers, including cup.nop.lol, mug.nop.lol, jar.nop.lol, and jug.nop.lol, to ensure that full-RBF nodes are interconnected and replacements can easily propagate. He encourages people to donate to his effort by sending BTC to bc1qagmufdn6rf80kj3faw4d0pnhxyr47sevp3nj9m.</p>
