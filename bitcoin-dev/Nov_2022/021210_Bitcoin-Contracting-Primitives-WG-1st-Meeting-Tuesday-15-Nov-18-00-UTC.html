    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A message was sent to the Bitcoin Developers, reminding them of the upcoming session on Tuesday and asking for their thoughts on the discussion topics. The list of topics includes anyprevout, recursive covenants, introspection, new malleability flags, ZK rollups, new contracting protocols, and other ideas. The sender also suggests adding CTV: BIP-119 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, stating that it is an easy and best possible way to get covenants with a lot of research and development. The meeting will take place on 15th November at 18:00 UTC, with a monthly frequency proposed. The venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and attendees are encouraged to share their expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest. Those who have been working on contracting protocols or other use-cases that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives can open an issue on GitHub. The sender also notes that there may be a need for a schedule that is inclusive of most time zones to ensure broad participation.</p>
