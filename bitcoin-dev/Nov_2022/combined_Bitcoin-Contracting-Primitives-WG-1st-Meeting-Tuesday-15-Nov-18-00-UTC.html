        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On November 15th, the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives working group held its first meeting with around ten attendees. The group discussed various covenant interests such as state channels, universal settlement layer, transaction introspection covenants, vaults/self-custody, MATT covenants, logical label covenant like transaction inherited IDs, congestion control, and DLC. The aim of the process should be to address misunderstandings of the state of development and desire for some covenant-style upgrade, coordinating around goals, drawbacks, and overlap of different proposals, and helping to highlight consensus building around the goals and mechanism to achieve them.The list of topics includes anyprevout, recursive covenants, introspection, new malleability flags, ZK rollups, new contracting protocols, and other ideas. The sender also suggests adding CTV: BIP-119 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, stating that it is an easy and best possible way to get covenants with a lot of research and development. The venue is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat, and attendees are encouraged to share their expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest. The sender also notes that there may be a need for a schedule that is inclusive of most time zones to ensure broad participation.Antoine Riard is starting a new community process to discuss various topics related to Bitcoin contracting primitives. The first session will take place on Tuesday, November 15th, at 18:00 UTC and will be held monthly. While there is no consistent agenda beyond the initial discussions, there have been suggestions to include a schedule that is inclusive of most time zones. Additionally, there have been some voices suggesting jitsi/audio-based meetings rather than IRC, though it comes with trade-offs. Overall, the aim of this community process is to discuss a variety of topics related to Bitcoin contracting primitives, including anyprevout, recursive covenants, introspection, new malleability flags, ZK rollups, and new contracting protocols.The communication venue for this is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat. Contributions are welcome, and attendees are encouraged to share their expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest related to this new covenants/contracting primitives R&D process. The frequency of these meetings will be monthly for now. If someone has been working on a contracting protocol/side-chain/roll-up or any other use-case that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives, they are encouraged to open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg/issues.The">https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg/issues.The</a> group plans to have a schedule inclusive of most time zones, and there have been more voices suggesting jitsi/audio-based meetings rather than IRC as an alternative communication format. The next meeting aims to do a 360-degree panorama of all the known consistent contracting primitives as well as the contracting protocols in an archiving effort. The frequency schedule for meetings is every month, staying on the 3rd Tuesday of every month. The meeting logs are available on GitHub, and attendees are encouraged to share their expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest.If anyone has been working on contracting protocols/side-chains/rollups/other use-cases that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives, they can open an issue on GitHub. The group is looking for attendees' expectations, ideas, and interests for the covenant/contracting primitives R&D process. The monthly meeting will be held in the #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg channel on Libera Chat. If a better schedule needs to be arranged to avoid conflicting with other public engineering meetings in the Bitcoin space, it can be discussed during the first session. There is no consistent agenda beyond discussion of topics of interest to attendees.</p>
