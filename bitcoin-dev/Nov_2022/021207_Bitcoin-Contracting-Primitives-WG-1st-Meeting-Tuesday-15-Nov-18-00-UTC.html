    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard is starting a new community process to discuss various topics related to Bitcoin contracting primitives. The first session will take place on Tuesday, November 15th at 18:00 UTC and will be held monthly. The venue for communication will be #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat. The agenda for the first meeting will consist of listening to every attendee's expectations, ideas, and subjects of interest related to the Bitcoin contracting primitives R&D process. If anyone has been working on contracting protocols, side-chains, rollups, or other use-cases that could benefit from extended Bitcoin contracting primitives, they are encouraged to open an issue on the GitHub page. While there is no consistent agenda beyond the initial discussions, there have been suggestions to include a schedule that is inclusive of most time zones. Additionally, there have been some voices suggesting jitsi/audio-based meetings rather than IRC, though it comes with trade-offs. Overall, the aim of this community process is to discuss a variety of topics related to Bitcoin contracting primitives, including anyprevout, recursive covenants, introspection, new malleability flags, ZK rollups, and new contracting protocols.</p>
