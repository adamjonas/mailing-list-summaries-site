    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Salvatore Ingala proposed an approach to enable general smart contracts in bitcoin using covenants. The notes can be found at <a href="https://merkle.fun/">https://merkle.fun/</a>. However, hash chained covenants are limited and may only serve as a stepping stone to greater functionality. It is suggested that any proposal for this sort of thing should include a plan for how it could be extended to support full-blown covenants in the future. Bitcoin should also consider taking verkle trees seriously as they can have substantially lower size/cost/weight than merkle trees, which could be applied not just to this proposal but to Bitcoin in general, as there seems to be no serious verkle tree proposals to date.</p>
