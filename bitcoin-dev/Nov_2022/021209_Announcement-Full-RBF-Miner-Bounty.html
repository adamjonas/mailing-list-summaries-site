    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Nov 8, 2022, Peter Todd announced that he had received a few hundred dollars worth of donations to the effort of testing full-RBF double-spends in Bitcoin. He raised the reward to about 0.02 BTC. On Nov 15, 2022, Anthony Towns via bitcoin-dev posted an update stating that the reward had been claimed already. He mentioned that he had enough donations to give it another run.However, mempool space is still an issue and there is always a risk of the mempool filling up again. Double spending with low-fee/high-fee method is easier now as the min relay fee keeps shifting. There was also another full-rbf double-spend from the Bob calendar, along the same lines - 7e76b351009326a574f3120164dbbe6d85e07e04a7bbdc40f0277fcb008d2cd2.The default mempool filled up on Nov 14, 2022, which led to the announcement and propagation of txs, including 397dcbe4. The block it was claimed in seems to have been about an hour after the default mempool filled up. The tx was later announced and propagated widely since conflicting tx f503868 had already been removed from default mempools. AntPool and an unknown exchange running with a larger than normal max mempool size limit did not keep the earlier 1.2sat/vb txs. The txs were mined by Foundry, indicating that there is currently no significant hashrate mining with fullrbf policies despite the bounty having been collected.</p>
