        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin code has a consensus rule that adding witness data to a non-segwit script is invalid. A PR has been created to detect such violations and ban the peer early. The link to the PR is provided for interested parties to review. Additionally, an alternative approach to running scripts of incoming transactions has been suggested, which involves validating utxos as a major part of validation. A conversation between Sergio Demian Lerner and Johnson Lau about the topic is also included in the context. They discuss how a check in the code prevents this attack and clarify that there is no real attack, despite discussions on Reddit. Lerner notes that he is asking the community for clarification, not asserting the existence of a vulnerability. The segwit code is complex, and some key parts of the consensus code are spread over the source files. Overall, it is important for interested parties to review the links provided and ask questions when necessary to ensure proper functioning of the code.</p>
