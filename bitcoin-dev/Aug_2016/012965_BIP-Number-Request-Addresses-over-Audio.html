    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a standardized way of representing Bitcoin addresses over audio. The idea was to take the binary representation of the address, chop it up into 4 or 2 bit chunks (depending on quality of audio), and generate a tone based on the value. The proposal came with error correction built into the protocol and was intended to make donating to podcasts easier. A full specification of the BIP can be found on the author's GitHub page. Another member of the mailing list proposed the addition of tones to denote an amount in satoshis. While it may not be feasible in most cases, there was no reason seen why it couldn't be built into the standard.</p>
