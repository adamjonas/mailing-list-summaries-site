    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 14th, 2016, user Cannon asked if there was a mailing list specifically for general users of Bitcoin. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is primarily focused on development-related topics. The user was seeking a forum for non-development questions related to Bitcoin.A link was provided in response to Cannon's inquiry. The link led to the bitcoin-discuss mailing list, which is intended for general discussion about Bitcoin and related technologies. This list is open to anyone who wants to participate and discuss various aspects of Bitcoin that may not be directly related to development.Overall, it appears that while the bitcoin-dev mailing list is tailored towards development-specific topics, the bitcoin-discuss mailing list is available for broader discussions about Bitcoin and its uses.</p>
