    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message expresses their belief that it wouldn't make sense to standardize current Bitcoin transactions as they are too complex. However, they suggest that having a similar standard for Segwit and Lightning transactions may be interesting. The author also notes that TREZOR performs extended validation of inputs, but the proposed standard does not address this. They believe that a better way to validate input amounts on the protocol level is necessary for the long term and that not having a standard for hardware wallet interfaces/communication will ultimately reduce the end user experience. The author proposes collaborating to work out a standard and mentions their goal of adding hardware wallet support in Bitcoin-Core without using proprietary code for security and compatibility reasons. They acknowledge that the "BIP" is still in draft form and are willing to include the input streaming proposal or allow the other party to add it since they have more experience with it.</p>
