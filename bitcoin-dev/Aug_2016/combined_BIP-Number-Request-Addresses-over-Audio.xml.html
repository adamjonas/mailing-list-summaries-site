        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty raised a question about whether it is possible to take a BIP32 public seed and determine if an address was derived from it. Pieter Wuille responded that computing all 2^31 possible public child addresses would be required to do so, which would take a quad-core laptop about eight hours with competent software. Aronesty also suggested that by revealing a public seed, anyone who has seen it could identify all payments to any address derived from that seed. Daniel Hoffman updated the GitHub for his proposed BIP on encoding bitcoin information in audio tones and asked for feedback on whether it was good enough to warrant an official BIP number. Pieter Wuille responded that a decoder for noisy/distorted channels would be necessary to really gauge viability, and that several other parties have tried and failed to transmit bitcoin information over audio in the past.</p>
