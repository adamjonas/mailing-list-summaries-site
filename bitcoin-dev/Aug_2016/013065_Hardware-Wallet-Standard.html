    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the usefulness of a signing protocol, which some believe is only useful for hardware wallets. However, one participant argues that any website that wants to request public keys/signatures and offload the responsibility for managing keys and signing to the user would find this valuable. The focus should not only be on servicing hardware but also on allowing users to pick their own ECDSA implementation, whether it be hardware or software. A member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list expresses agreement with this sentiment, stating that driving any hardware wallet from the wallet itself or from a third party daemon implementing that URL scheme would provide better device interoperability, as well as easier maintenance and update paths for the wallets.</p>
