    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list starts with a user named Trevin Hofmann asking if it would be feasible to transmit an entire BIP21 URI as audio. Daniel Hoffman proposes his BIP idea of representing Bitcoin addresses over audio using a fast, robust, and standardized protocol with error correction built-in. He wanted to make it easy for consumers to donate to podcasts they listen to by using a Shazam-like app or media player that gives them an address automatically. Justin Newton from Netki Inc. suggests adding additional tones to optionally denote an amount in satoshis. In response to his initial proposal, Daniel updates his GitHub page and makes samples available for MP3 and FLAC of both tone tables, first 16 then 4. He asks what suggestions others may have for improving the proposal. In light of this discussion, it is suggested that instead of reinventing the wheel, the AudioModem and Chirp technologies be checked out along with the Network World article, which discusses sending data over sound using bitcoin.</p>
