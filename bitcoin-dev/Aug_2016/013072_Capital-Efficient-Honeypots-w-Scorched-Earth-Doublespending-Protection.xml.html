    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was held on how to prevent insider attacks and determining the culprit when money is stolen from a compromised server. Peter Todd suggested a smart contract that incentivizes publication of a hacked server. The funding was organized by storing all coins in one address, but each server had a unique signature. Splitting up the coins into different outputs could encourage owners to act quickly upon discovering a breach. However, it's essential to note that owners can still redeem the coins at any time. The incentive for intruders is to collect the honeypot as soon as possible to maximize their chances of being rewarded.</p>
