    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in the context is about the concept of honeypots, which are used to isolate and monitor data that appears to be a legitimate part of a site but is actually being monitored for attackers. The proposal under discussion is not quite a traditional honeypot since it offers a reward to attackers, making it okay for them to know they've been detected. It is suggested that a better term might be "compromise canary" or "intruder bait". The analogy to wildlife animal research is offered, where bait is used to attract targets and discover their existence, even when there is no intention of harming the animal.</p>
