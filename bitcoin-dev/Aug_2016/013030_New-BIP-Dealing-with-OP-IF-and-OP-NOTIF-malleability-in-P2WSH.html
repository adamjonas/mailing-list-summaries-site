    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Russell O'Connor discussed his concerns about fighting script malleability. He acknowledged that he was not opposed to BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) but felt that leaving one avenue of malleability open is just as bad as having many. However, some types of malleability are less harmful than others, such as changing a few bits with an ECC transformation, versus being able to append arbitrary data to a transaction's input script. The cleanstack rule in segwit helps prevent the latter and is consensus-enforced. The email signature contained a non-text attachment called 'signature.asc' which was a digital signature file.</p>
