    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer, responded to a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding a proposal made by James MacWhyte. MacWhyte proposed a change to the Bitcoin protocol that would obscure transaction details from miners in order to increase privacy. Todd responded by stating that while verifying transactions is an optimization, preventing double-spending is a fundamental requirement of Bitcoin and this proposal does prevent double-spending perfectly well. He further stated that MacWhyte's proposal sounds similar to his own proposal from 2016 which focused on closed seal sets and truth lists for privacy. Todd's proposal aimed to improve user privacy without sacrificing the ability to prevent double-spending.</p>
