    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The BIP146 has recently been updated to include NULLDUMMY as part of the softfork. This update can be found on the Github page of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The aim of this trivial softfork is to fix malleability related to the extra stack element consumed by CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY). It is considered an important update as it prevents an attacker from replacing the stack element with any value, which could have serious implications. This update is deemed more significant than LOW_S, as without it, there is a risk of stack element replacement by attackers. The inclusion of NULLDUMMY in BIP146 is an effort to address this issue and ensure the security of the cryptocurrency system. Overall, this update serves as an example of the continuous improvement made to the Bitcoin protocol in order to enhance security and prevent malicious attacks.</p>
