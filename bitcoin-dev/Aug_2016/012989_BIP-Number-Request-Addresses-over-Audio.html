    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty suggested that sending a public seed would prevent someone from tracing the total amount of payments to it. However, Pieter Wuille pointed out that by revealing a public seed, anyone who has seen it can identify all payments to any address derived from that seed. This means that revealing a public seed can compromise the privacy of all transactions made with addresses derived from that seed. The email thread also included information about the Bitcoin-dev mailing list and how to subscribe to it.</p>
