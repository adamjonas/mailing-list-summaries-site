    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user posed a hypothetical scenario on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding what would happen if they generated 21 addresses and address0 received funds 180 days after generation while address21 immediately received funds. This would trigger a resize+20 of the address-lookup-window, but the wallet would need to go back 180 days to detect any transactions for address21 in a new lookup-window. This scenario is not unrealistic as a merchant might generate addresses beyond their gap limit and orders get filled at a later date. The lack of consideration for these cases is another issue with BIP44. It was also noted that restoring a wallet in a block-scanning wallet versus Electrum may yield different results due to the scenario described.</p>
