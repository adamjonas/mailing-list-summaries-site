    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the concept of driving signing workflow by wallet software which the user fundamentally disagrees with. The required data to verify and sign a standard bitcoin transaction, including P2WSH multi-sig, is manageable. Currently, the TREZOR protocol works like device is a server and wallet is a client calling methods on it. Multiple rounds would still be possible with a clever design and passing a 300kb chunk over a URI scheme requires a couple of milliseconds on standard Smartphones or PCs. The user thinks that rather than finding any minimal URI-based API good enough for communicating with all vendors, some third party libraries defining high-level API and implementing hardware-specific protocols and transports as plugins would be more likely. The URI-based API allows transmitting data of multiple megabytes while there is no need for dependencies of any form, library support for a particular language, or platform that supports the dependencies of the library.</p>
