    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the context mentioned working on a decoder that compares each cycle of a recorded sine wave with a certain frequency. The function returns the last sample that falls in that range over all samples, and the longest chain to match up with a certain frequency is interpreted as that frequency. They plan to extrapolate the sine wave to more samples but this works okay for testing. Additionally, they are preparing the documentation per the official BIP spec. The GitHub link provided in the context leads to the author's repository, where they have uploaded their work on BIP-0170. The author is unsure whether it is okay to host the BIP on their own GitHub or if they need to host it on a more official repository.</p>
