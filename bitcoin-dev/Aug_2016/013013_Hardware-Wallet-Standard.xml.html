    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email, Jochen provides feedback to Jonas on the draft for a standard that describes detached signing. Jochen notes that the wallet also needs to connect with a hardware wallet at some point to learn the xpubs controlled by the hardware and asks whether this should be included in a separate standard or added to the current one. He highlights several points missing from the specification that a fully checking hardware wallet needs to know, including the amount spent by each input, full serialized input transactions without witness information, and the position of the change output and its HD Path. Jochen suggests that the standard should allow for giving the parent xpubs of other public keys and their derivation paths for multisig inputs and multisig change addresses. Regarding the "inputscript," Jochen finds it ambiguous, particularly for p2sh transactions. He suggests a potential solution where the witness and scriptSig are put in the raw transaction, and inputscript becomes the scriptPubKey of the corresponding output.</p>
