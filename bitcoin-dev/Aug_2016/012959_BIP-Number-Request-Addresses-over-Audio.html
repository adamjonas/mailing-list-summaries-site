    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list for a standardized method of representing Bitcoin addresses over audio. The proposal involves taking the binary representation of the Bitcoin address and generating tones based on 4 or 2 bit chunks, depending on the quality of the audio. The proposal includes error correction built into the protocol. Justin Newton replied to the proposal, suggesting the addition of additional tones to denote optional amounts in satoshis. The full specification of the BIP can be viewed on the author's GitHub page. The proposed method could have useful use cases, such as providing an easy way to donate to podcasts. The author also mentions that they would not worry about payment requests until a decoder was built and the transmission was made faster, likely by adding tones and making it 5 bits wide.</p>
