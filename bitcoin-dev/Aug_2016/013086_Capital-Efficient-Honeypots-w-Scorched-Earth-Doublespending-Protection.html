    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a communication on bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gregory Maxwell and Christian Decker discussed the use of tripwires to protect a company from cyber threats. They discussed how an intruder might try to avoid tripwires if they were planning to use it as a foothold to further compromise the company by sending spam or similar activities. The value of the intruder's activity compared to the value of coins was also a factor in deciding whether covert or shared tripwires would be better. Having overt tripwires did not preclude having covert tripwires as well. Finally, they suggested that standardizing the location of tripwires could make it easier for intruders to find funds and proposed "/var/honeypot" as a possible Standardâ„¢ location.</p>
