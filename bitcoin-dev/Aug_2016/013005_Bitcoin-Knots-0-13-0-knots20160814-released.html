    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Knots version 0.13.0.knots20160814 has been released with new features, bug fixes and performance improvements. Users are suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS that is supported as Windows XP is no longer supported from this release onwards. Under the Compact Blocks support, ordinary non-mining nodes will download and upload blocks faster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction filtering policies. The RPC command line client has gained a new argument, `-stdin` to read extra arguments from standard input. Various code modernizations have been done including C++11 and Python 3. Linux ARM builds have been added to the uploaded executables. The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions. Reindexing did validation while reading through the block files on disk earlier, but now these two have been split up. The internal miner has been removed in this release, and replaced with a simpler implementation for the test framework. Low-level P2P changes have been made and the P2P alert system has been removed.Bitcoin Knots 0.13.0 has brought many changes including low-level RPC and ZMQ changes, transaction relay mechanism redesign, and updating the mempool command. The relay code was redesigned to sort transactions according to dependency order while batching them, reducing orphan transactions and doubling the frequency of batch sending for outgoing peers. Mempool messages are no longer handled for non-whitelisted peers when NODE_BLOOM is disabled through -peerbloomfilters=0.There have also been several other RPC changes including new commands and the removal of old ones. Other changes include improved block and transaction handling with more efficient mapTx indices and the implementation of "feefilter" P2P message.The latest version of Bitcoin Core, v0.13.1, includes a number of performance and privacy improvements, as well as bug fixes and updates to the build system. Among the changes are several performance improvements to inv/mempool handling, which should improve the overall speed of transaction processing and block propagation. There are also several GUI improvements, including the ability to show details for multiple transactions, user confirmation delay for sending, an option to disable the system tray icon and more. Additionally, there are a number of updates to the build system, including support for C++11, and various bug fixes. The release notes detail each individual change, including links to the relevant pull requests on Github.The Bitcoin core developers have released a new version of the software, version 0.13.1, which contains a number of bug fixes and improvements. Among the changes for the network are #8288, which introduces a network-specific example address, and #8407, which adds a dbcache migration path. Additionally, there have been several changes to the wallet, including #8219, which improves the CWallet API with new AccountMove function, and #8035, which adds a simplest BIP32/deterministic key generation implementation. Other changes include #8256, which fixes a bitcoin-qt crash, and #8129, which fixes an issue with the RPC console auto completer.There were also some changes to the user interface, such as #8207, which adds a link to the Bitcoin-Core repository and website to the About Dialog, and #7636, which adds a bitcoin address label to request payment QR code. The release notes provide more detail on these changes.</p>
