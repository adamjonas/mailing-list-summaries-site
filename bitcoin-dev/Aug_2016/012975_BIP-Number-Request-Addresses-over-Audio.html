    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made for a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at representing Bitcoin addresses over audio. The idea is to take the binary representation of the Bitcoin address and generate a tone based upon that value, which could be used to donate to podcasts or any other use case that requires an easy way to give a Bitcoin address to someone else. The BIP comes with built-in error correction. However, some have voiced concerns about the efficiency of repeating a message multiple times as a method of error recovery. Other suggestions include trellis modulation or other convolutional codes. Additionally, Thomas Daede via bitcoin-dev recommended looking at existing implementations of audio modems to learn from past work. It was also suggested that the selected frequencies are harmonics of each other, meaning nonlinear distortion will make detection more difficult, and that the Bell 202 and similar modem standards chose AFSK frequencies to minimize interference. Finally, it was proposed to define channel models to simulate various use cases to help determine if requirements have been met.</p>
