    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Chris Priest suggested that if the blocksize limit were to be changed to a block output limit, it should be set at roughly the amount of outputs found in 1MB blocks currently. However, this could also create potential denial-of-service (DoS) vectors for miners who have an incentive to create larger blocks that take their competitors longer to receive and validate. Restrictions are necessary to maintain a level playing field between all miners. According to Peter Todd's blog post, serialized size is one of the most fundamental things that needs to be limited to prevent these issues. Despite arguments against keeping usage restricted, restrictions are still necessary in some cases.</p>
