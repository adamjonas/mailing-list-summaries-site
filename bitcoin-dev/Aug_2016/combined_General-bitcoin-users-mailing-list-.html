        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On August 14th, 2016, a user named Cannon sent a message to the bitcoin-dev mailing list inquiring about the existence of a mailing list specifically for general users of Bitcoin. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is primarily focused on development-related topics and Cannon was looking for a forum for non-development questions related to Bitcoin. In response to Cannon's inquiry, a link was provided leading to the bitcoin-discuss mailing list, which is intended for general discussion about Bitcoin and related technologies. This mailing list is open to anyone who wants to participate and discuss various aspects of Bitcoin that may not be directly related to development.In another email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 13, 2016, Cannon sought information about a general users mailing list for bitcoin-related topics that do not necessarily involve development. The bitcoin-dev mailing list is specifically designed for development-related discussions, so Cannon was searching for a platform for more general conversations. In this email, Cannon included their contact information, including a PGP fingerprint, Bitmessage address, and Ricochet-IM.As a response to Cannon's inquiry, other users suggested exploring the /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits on Reddit as potential forums for more general discussions about Bitcoin.To summarize, the author of the communication posed a question regarding the existence of a mailing list for general users of Bitcoin, separate from the development-focused bitcoin-dev mailing list. They provided their contact information and were directed towards the bitcoin-discuss mailing list as well as the /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits on Reddit for broader discussions about Bitcoin.</p>
