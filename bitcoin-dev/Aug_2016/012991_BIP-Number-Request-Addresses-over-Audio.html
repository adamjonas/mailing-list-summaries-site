    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development forum, a user suggested the existence of a BIP for a public seed that would allow someone to generate new random addresses but not be able to easily verify if an address was derived from that seed. However, Pieter Wuille, another user in the forum, pointed out that by revealing a public seed, it would allow anyone who has seen it to identify all payments to any address derived from the seed. This means that there would be no privacy in transactions and the total amount of payments to the transmitted address could be traced.</p>
