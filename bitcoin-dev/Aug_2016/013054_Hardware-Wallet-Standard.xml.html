    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to allow both a detached signer and a normal wallet to verify the correctness of generated addresses before coins are sent there. This would involve giving a hardware wallet's master public key to Bitcoin Core, which would then generate receiving addresses that could be validated by the hardware wallet. The fear of a cosmic ray flipping a bit during address generation and resulting in lost funds is a concern for some users, leading them to generate addresses on two independent machines using different software. However, the proposed scheme would offer protection against losing money due to a defective hardware wallet. The possibility of an evil hardware wallet still exists, but it is more likely to be quickly discovered.</p>
