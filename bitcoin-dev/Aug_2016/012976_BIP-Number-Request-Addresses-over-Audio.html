    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Daniel Hoffman has updated the GitHub with some changes and samples of both tone tables. He is wondering if it is good enough to warrant an official BIP number. Though he hasn't built a decoder yet, he believes that the encoder is working properly as he has looked at Audacity. Some people on Reddit want to "allow for decoding experiments". However, without a decoder, it's not a proposal yet, just an idea. FSK modems microphone-channel (terrible multipath) is quite challenging, and several other parties have tried to do bitcoin info over audio in the past without success. The decoder for noisy/distorted channels will be 99.9% of the complexity and will completely control the design of the encoder. It's very interesting, but to gauge its viability, Daniel needs to get the whole thing working.</p>
