    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 1, 2016, Luke Dashjr proposed an initial draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aimed to provide clarity on the Status field for BIPs. The proposal also introduced the ability for public comments as well as expanding the list of allowable BIP licenses. The draft was shared on GitHub and discussions were planned to make this BIP an Active status along with BIP 123 one month after revisions had been completed. However, Gavin Andresen expressed his concerns regarding the definition of "consensus" described in the proposal, stating that it gives too much centralized control to whoever controls the mailing list and wiki.</p>
