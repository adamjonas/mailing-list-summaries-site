        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr engaged in a discussion about upgrading five Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) from Draft to Final status. One of these BIPs, BIP 50, was specifically addressed by Peter Todd. He suggested that referring to the March 2013 Chain Fork described in BIP 50 as a "hard fork" oversimplifies the nuances of what occurred during that fork. However, he agreed that some rephrasing of BIP 50 could be beneficial. Peter Todd also noted that despite the issues with the pre-March protocol, the May 2013 change was undoubtedly a hard fork. The proposal for the upgrade is available on GitHub and requires the acknowledgment (ACK) of the BIP champions.Luke Dashjr proposed an upgrade to five additional BIPs on February 8, 2016, seeking their approval to transition from Draft to Final status. One of these BIPs is BIP 50, which focuses on the March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem written by Gavin Andresen. During the discussion, it was suggested that describing this fork as a "hard fork" might not accurately capture the situation. The rejection of the chain by version 0.7 was non-deterministic and depended on observing a specific type of reorganization. Notably, a digital signature was attached to the email exchanged during this discussion.The Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are currently undergoing updates, including proposed changes to the status of several BIPs. These updates are being discussed on GitHub and encompass modifications such as elevating Accepted BIPs to Final status. The proposal has been open for a week and is expected to be merged within the next week, unless any objections arise. Additionally, another proposal aims to upgrade five more BIPs, transitioning them from Draft to Final status. The champions of these BIPs have been called upon to provide their acknowledgments (ACKs). The BIPs targeted for upgrade are the March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem, Fixed Length "version" Message (Relay-Transactions Field), getutxo message, Strict DER signatures, and Use "Accept" header for response type negotiation with Payment Request URLs.</p>
