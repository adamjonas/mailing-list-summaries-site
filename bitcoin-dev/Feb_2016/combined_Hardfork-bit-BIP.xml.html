        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Gavin Andresen expressed disagreement with the proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and questioned items two and three of the proposal's motivations. He suggested that a better idea would be a BIP that recommends Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients pay attention to block version numbers in headers and warn if there is a soft or hard fork they don't know about. The proposal suggests using negative block version numbers as a mechanism to indicate a hardfork is deployed, but this is criticized by Andresen as it does not improve the situation regarding chain-forking.For SPV nodes that do not pay attention to versions in block headers, setting the block version negative would not help them. Instead, Andresen suggests paying attention to block version and timestamp numbers in the headers they download, which will warn if there is a soft or hard fork they don't know about and mitigate Sybil attacks. There was also a discussion on whether a re-org of 2000 or more blocks would be possible and its impact on the Bitcoin network. One participant contended that it would cause economic chaos, while another disagreed.On February 4th, 2016, jl2012 via bitcoin-dev proposed a change in the "version" field of Bitcoin block headers to indicate the deployment of a hardfork, suggesting employing the version bits mechanism to measure miner support towards a hardfork proposal and determine the time threshold of the flag block. The proposal recommends using the hardfork version bit as a mechanism to ensure a clean break during an emergency hardfork, even though median-time-past and height are superior methods that ought to be used for hardforks. The proposal recommends avoiding implying that BIP 9 should be used for hardforks or that miners have any voice in the decision. Any planned hardfork must have one and only one flag block that serves as the "point of no return," determined by block height or as the first block with GetMedianTimePast() greater than a threshold. The proposal also suggests employing the version bits mechanism to measure miner support towards a hardfork proposal and determine the time threshold of the flag block. While there is disagreement over whether BIP9 should be used for hardforks, it is suggested that median-time-past and height are superior methods that ought to be used for hardforks.In addition, SPV clients should pay attention to block version numbers in headers and warn if there is a soft or hard fork they don't know about. Gavin Andresen questions the motivations behind the BIP, suggesting that full nodes and SPV nodes should recognize up-version blocks and alert users of obsolete software regardless of whether it is due to a hard or soft fork. He also believes that using a grace period essentially eliminates the risk of unexpected behavior when following the new chain. There is also discussion on the possibility of a blockchain re-org and its impact on the Bitcoin network. One participant suggests that a checkpoint would likely be imposed to get everyone back onto the same chain for economic transactions, while another believes that nothing about a hard fork should be considered an emergency as there is time to prepare a safe and responsible way to upgrade the network without unilaterally declaring obsolescence.Overall, the proposed mechanism aims to introduce clarity and prevent risks related to hardforks in the Bitcoin network. However, there are disagreements over the best methods to implement this mechanism and address potential issues such as SPV client awareness and the impact of a blockchain re-org. The security of low-confirmation transactions sent to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets is impacted more by soft forks than hard forks, contrary to popular belief. Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed his opinion that BIP is unnecessary, taking issue with several points of the proposal and arguing that SPV clients should pay attention to block version numbers in headers and warn if there is a soft or hard fork they don't know about. He believes that if a hard fork increases the version number in blocks, then full and SPV nodes should notice they are seeing up-version blocks and warn users they are using obsolete software.In a discussion regarding the addition of Concept ACK to BIP99, it was suggested that SPV clients should also pay attention to timestamps to mitigate Sybil attacks. It is unclear if Core enforces the 95% rule for soft-forks before checking for long forks, and it is assumed to occur during header checks rather than full block checks.</p>
