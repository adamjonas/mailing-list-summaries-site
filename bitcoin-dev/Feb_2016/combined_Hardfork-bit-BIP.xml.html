        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 4th, 2016, jl2012 suggested in the bitcoin-dev forum that the version number flag is not enough to ensure security in the deployed network. This is due to many clients not validating the version field, which is caused by their disinterest in security. To fully achieve the intended effect using the highest bit of prev would currently be much more effective. On February 7th, Gavin responded to jl2012's post, stating that transaction validation rule changes are a big concern for lightweight clients. He argues that soft-forks affect the security of low-confirmation transactions sent to SPV wallets even more than hard forks. However, aj believes that ensuring soft-forks only affect non-standard transactions already addresses that concern in every way he has been able to discover.</p>
