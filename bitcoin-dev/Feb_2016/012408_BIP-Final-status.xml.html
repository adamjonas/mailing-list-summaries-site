    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Feb 8, 2016, Luke Dashjr proposed an upgrade to five additional Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) from Draft to Final status, seeking the approval of the BIP champions. One of these BIPs, BIP 50, which describes the March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem, authored by Gavin Andresen, was discussed in particular. It was suggested that the description of this fork as a "hard fork" is not entirely accurate, as the rejection of the chain by version 0.7 was non-deterministic and depended on seeing a reorganization in a specific way. Meanwhile, a digital signature was attached to the email.</p>
