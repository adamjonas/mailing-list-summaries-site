    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 26, 2016, Joseph Poon via bitcoin-dev proposed a SIGHASH flag called SIGHASH_NOINPUT. This flag would not include the outpoint being spent or the amount as part of the signature, but it would include the spent outpoint's script. While this is just a SIGHASH flag, outpoints are still included as part of txins, allowing for a signature to apply to anything with that pubkey. However, pubkeys with this flag should not be reused. This proposed flag would make it possible to write fully malleability-proof wallet software.For safety reasons, SIGHASH_NOINPUT would only apply in SegWit transactions. As SegWit provides sufficient malleability solutions, there is no incentive to improperly use this sighash flag as a roundabout way to resolve malleability. Although SegWit's malleability solution is not considered sufficient compared to SIGHASH_NOINPUT, making this flag available to pre-SegWit transactions would complicate matters unnecessarily.</p>
