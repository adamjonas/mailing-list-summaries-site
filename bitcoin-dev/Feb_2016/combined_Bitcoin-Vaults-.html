        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>At the 3rd Bitcoin Workshop in Barbados, a new idea has been presented to improve Bitcoin wallet security and deter thefts. The concept involves creating vaults - special accounts with keys that can be neutralized if they fall into the hands of attackers, thus rendering their transactions null and void. This approach discourages key theft as attackers are less likely to attack knowing they won't get away with it. The process is simple: money is sent to a vault address with a vault key and a recovery key. When spending money from the vault address with the corresponding vault key, a predetermined waiting period must be observed before the funds can be unlocked and transferred to a standard address and spent in the usual way. If an attacker obtains the vault key, the owner has 24 hours to revert any transaction issued by the attacker using the recovery key.This technique relies on a single new opcode called CheckOutputVerify, which checks the shape of a redeem transaction. It is suggested that this could significantly deter Bitcoin thefts. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>
