    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Toby Padilla expressed his dislike for the idea of policing other people's use of the protocol and suggested that as long as a transaction pays its fee and has a greater than dust value, there should be no objection to it. In response, Peter Todd noted that getting a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) for a feature is not a hard requirement for deployment and encouraged Toby to write up his own BIP document with a non-numerical name for ease of reference. Todd further emphasized that the Bitcoin community should not be seen as gatekeepers for how people choose to use Bitcoin. Todd also made it clear that any personal opinions expressed about a feature should not be considered a judgement on whether it should be accepted as a BIP. The criteria for acceptance should still be met regardless of personal opinions. Additionally, having a BIP accepted does not mean that wallets are required to implement it; this decision is left up to individual wallet authors and maintainers.</p>
