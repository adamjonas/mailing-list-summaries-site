    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin development, a user inquired about confidential transactions and how the receiver of such a transaction could check the amount sent to them. The responder stated that the blinding factor would be included in the extra data incorporated into the ring signatures used in the range proof. However, they noted that the range proof is optional for single output transactions. If the range proof is used, it would require segwit and adding extraneous data wouldn't be much of a problem. In both cases, the blinding factor would likely be protected from outside examination via some form of shared secret generation, but this would require the sender to know the recipient's unhashed public key. The responder was unsure of any shared secret schemes that would work on hashed keys.</p>
