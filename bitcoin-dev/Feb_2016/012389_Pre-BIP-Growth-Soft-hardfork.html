    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A draft BIP has been shared by Luke Dashjr for Pre-BIP Growth Soft-hardfork. The BIP aims to deploy proper merge-mining as suggested by Satoshi, expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip and providing a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes vulnerable to attack. The first implementation of the BIP might be painful, but it will make future hardforks easier. The proposal suggests including the median timestamp of the past 11 blocks after the block height in coinbase to make it easier to use it as an activation threshold of consensus rule changes. It also proposes to treat witness commitment as a merge mined commitment. Miners are emphasized to ensure that the hardfork is accepted by the supermajority of the economy.</p>
