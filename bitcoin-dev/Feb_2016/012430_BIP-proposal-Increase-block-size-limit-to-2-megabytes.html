    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>David Vorick, a member of the Bitcoin development community, raised concerns about the definition of "unmaintained" nodes in a post on bitcoin-dev. He argued that 0.10 nodes, which have not been updated since the 0.11 release, should not be considered unmaintained because they are still being used by Gentoo package managers who update their software regularly. Vorick also expressed confusion over the utility of more nodes, suggesting that people are concerned about a reduction in decentralisation rather than the number of full nodes. He also questioned the validity of promises from individuals and companies to spin up more nodes and test infrastructure for supporting 2MB blocks. Finally, he suggested that increasing the blocksize to 2MB could make it even more expensive to run a node, leading to consolidation of nodes into the control of wealthy parties who can afford powerful hardware.</p>
