    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer expresses satisfaction over a significant reduction in the volume of emails received, which has made it easier for him to skim through and read what is relevant. He used to delete many dev emails because he could not keep up with the quantity. The change has improved his life. In an email thread, Dave Scotese emphasizes that contributors should provide readers with additional evidence in favor of something, rather than just stating the number of people supporting it. On the same thread, Gavin suggests that comments should contribute to the discussion, either by providing technical details or relevant data. A +1 vote should be accompanied by a unique explanation rather than simply restating a previous comment.</p>
