        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) is a transaction protocol that enables a buyer to purchase information from a seller using Bitcoin in a private, scalable, and secure manner that doesn't require trust in anyone. It eliminates the need for third-party arbitration, as the expected information is transferred only if payment is made. This type of sale is irreversible, potentially crosses multiple jurisdictions, and involves parties whose financial stability is uncertain, meaning that both parties either take a great deal of risk or have to make difficult arrangements.Gregory Maxwell successfully demonstrated the ZKCP on the Bitcoin network by purchasing a solution to a 16x16 Sudoku puzzle for 0.10 BTC from Sean Bowe, a member of the Zcash team. The transfer involved two transactions and was part of a live demonstration at Financial Cryptography 2016 in Barbados. Almost all the engineering work behind this ZKCP implementation was done by Sean Bowe, with support from Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell, and Madars Virza.The SKCP system ensures that the person who performed the trusted setup cannot extract any information from a proof. This means it is proven hard to obtain information from a proof by the buyer. More technical details about ZKCP can be found at the provided link <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/.Discussions">https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/26/zero-knowledge-contingent-payments-announcement/.Discussions</a> have also been taking place regarding atomic cross-chain transfers between Bitcoin and legacy altcoins, which can be achieved with a cut-and-choose scheme. On February 26, 2016, Tier Nolan suggested using a single-show-signature scheme he created on the Bitcoin side to force the Bitcoin side to reveal a private key. Gregory Maxwell also suggested using a scheme he had previously developed in an email exchange on the same day.Gregory Maxwell announced the successful transaction using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) on the Bitcoin network via bitcoin-dev mailing list. The buyer also hopes to have a ZKCP sudoku buying faucet up shortly.</p>
