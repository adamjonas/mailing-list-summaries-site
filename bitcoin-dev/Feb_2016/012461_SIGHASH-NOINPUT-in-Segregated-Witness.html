    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Joseph Poon suggested adding "a without-inputs SIGHASH flag" to make it easier to create a transaction that spends from the same inputs as another transaction. However, this could lead to replay attacks where transactions are duplicated on different chains. Therefore, Poon suggests that if such a feature were added, developers should also deploy a fee-committing sighash-all option to ensure hardware wallets don't leave users exposed to these attacks. He also suggests that a vulnerability to replay attacks should be called out in any proposed BIP and even suggests naming the new feature "SIGHASH_REPLAY_VULNERABLE." The design of SegWit was carefully crafted to allow for safe soft-forks for future script enhancements, and Poon warns against scope creep and insists on being ruthless about changes beyond what's necessary for a safe deployment of SegWit. As such, he recommends constructing the proposed feature as a new SegWit script type rather than a base feature.</p>
