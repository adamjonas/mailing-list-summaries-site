    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A BIP for updating getblocktemplate for segregated witness has been drafted by Luke Dashjr. There is a noticeable absence of the "default_witness_commitment" key, which is added by the current reference implementation. The omission could be due to the need for clients to create their commitment rather than having it provided to them. The two approaches are not at odds with each other, as it allows for simpler use-cases where the tx's are to be used as-is from bitcoind. However, omitting the key increases the burden on mining software and increases the odds of bugs in the process. Cory, who supports this argument, will PR this change to the BIP, which will allow for mining software to handle more serialization and calculation of complex structures. Links to related sources have also been provided.</p>
