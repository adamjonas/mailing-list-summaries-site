    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community seems to have unified around a single vision - roughly 2MB of transactions per block, whether via Segregated Witness or via a hard fork. Additionally, segregated witness should be implemented in the near future and that hard forks will be a necessity at some point. The technical community working together to plan for all of the things that might go wrong is key to not destroying significant value. Here is a proposed outline (to activate only after SegWit and with the currently-proposed version of SegWit): The segregated witness discount is changed from 75% to 50%. The block size limit (ie transactions + witness/2) is set to 1.5MB. In order to prevent significant blowups in the cost to validate pessimistic blocks, we must place additional limits on the size of many non-segwit transactions. scriptPubKeys are now limited to 100 bytes in size and may not contain OP_CODESEPARATOR, scriptSigs must be push-only, and transactions are only allowed to contain up to 20 non-segwit inputs. Move SegWit's generic commitments from an OP_RETURN output to a second branch in the merkle tree. Instead of requiring the first four bytes of the previous block hash field be 0s, we allow them to contain any value.</p>
