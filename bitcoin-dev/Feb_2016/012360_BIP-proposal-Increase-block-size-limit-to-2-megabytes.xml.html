    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 5, 2016, Gavin Andresen posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list to share a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that would increase the block size limit to 2,000,000 bytes. According to Andresen, the proposal had been reviewed by merchants, miners, and exchanges for a couple of weeks and had already been implemented and tested as part of the Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT implementations. The proposal included an accurate sigop counting with an existing sigop limit of 20,000 and a new high limit on signature hashing. Additionally, Andresen shared a blog post walking through the code and another post on some of the constants chosen.However, one commenter responded by saying that while they were glad to see a BIP, it was strange to ask for feedback after releasing binaries. They also argued that the issue wasn't whether or not it was a good idea to roll out a hard fork but rather how to do safe hard fork deployment and what the technological requirements are for doing so. The commenter took issue with the proposed 75% miner signalling with a 28-day flag day thereafter, which they believed gave virtually no time for the entire ecosystem to migrate and was widely considered unsafe. They pointed out that it was plainly obvious that an entire ecosystem of 5000 full nodes could not be prepared in a month.</p>
