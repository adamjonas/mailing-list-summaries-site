        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Matt Corallo, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has expressed his support for a proposal to implement changes gradually and in stages. He suggests that only one hardfork should be scheduled at a time to avoid complications. The first hardfork should include necessary changes based on reasonable designs, and after seeing its outcome, a second hardfork can then be considered. Corallo agrees with most of the proposal but wants more time to consider Luke's header changes. He also suggests adding timewarp fixes for enhanced safety and reduced disruption. It is worth noting that any client designed for stage 2 should also be ready for stage 3. This approach could help ensure smoother implementation and adoption of changes.The proposed changes include increasing the block size for Bitcoin, which has been a contentious issue within the community. By breaking down the changes into stages and carefully considering their impact, developers hope to address concerns and improve the overall functioning of the network. Overall, the proposal aims to balance the need for innovation and growth with stability and security. To ensure everyone has enough time to upgrade, a proposed roadmap is presented with three stages of rule changes. Stage one is Segregated Witness, which will not break any existing full or light nodes. Stage two includes fixes that will break existing full nodes but not light nodes, including increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and anti-DoS rules for non-segwit scripts. Stage three includes fixes that will break all existing full and light nodes, including changing the header format to Luke-Jr's proposal and fixing the time warp attack. An alternative roadmap delays stage two until mid-2017 or later but includes changes that still break existing nodes. Both proposals have pros and cons, with the first being less disruptive and the second being safer. Miners have a responsibility to confirm that the supermajority of the community accepts changes in stages two and three. Matt Corallo's and Luke-Jr's proposals are referenced. The proposal has gained support from developers like Corallo, and it will be interesting to see how this approach evolves and impacts the future of Bitcoin.</p>
