    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, developers are considering a new feature that would allow for outsourced monitoring of Lightning network channels. The idea is to have three transactions: an anchor transaction, a commitment transaction, and a penalty transaction. The commitment transaction includes multiple payments and HTLCs to different parties, while the penalty transaction enables one party to take 99% of the commitment transaction's value in case of foul play. Outsourcing the monitoring of these channels could be useful, but would require sending a lot of data to the chain-monitoring service. Additionally, there is a concern about the vulnerability to replay attacks, which could result in loss of funds if not implemented carefully. Developers are looking into constructing this as a new segwit script type, rather than a base feature.</p>
