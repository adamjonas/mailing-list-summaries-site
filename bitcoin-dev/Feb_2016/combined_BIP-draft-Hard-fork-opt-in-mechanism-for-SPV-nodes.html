        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On February 5th, 2016, Johnson Lau proposed a new algorithm for the transaction commitment in block header to ensure that Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes will not automatically follow a planned hard fork without explicit opt-in consent. The proposal commits Double-SHA256(zero|merkle_root|zero), where zero is 0x0000....0000 with 32 bytes, instead of directly committing the Merkle root to the header. This mechanism intentionally breaks backward compatibility as a mechanism to indicate hard fork deployment. However, non-upgraded full nodes and SPV nodes can still verify the proof-of-work of upgraded blocks. Hard forks without any malicious intention may also be considered as a "fraud" among non-upgraded nodes. With this proposal, non-upgraded SPV nodes will always believe the new chain is valid while they cannot be defrauded as they will not see any incoming transactions.Lau's proposal is a supplement to the hardfork bit BIP and makes sure SPV nodes won't lose any money in a hard fork, even if they do not check the hardfork bit. The proposed BIP is authored by Johnson Lau and is still in draft mode. A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been introduced by Johnson Lau, suggesting a solution for the potential issues that may arise among non-upgraded nodes during a hard fork. The proposal suggests changing the padding value of the block header to ensure non-upgraded Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes always believe that the new chain is valid, while also not being able to be defrauded as they will not receive any incoming transactions. This proposal is still in draft mode and has been placed in the public domain. However, its compatibility may need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and changing the padding value may not be needed in some cases, as it could lead to unnecessary disruption.</p>
