    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, two different opinions were expressed regarding the possibility of a blockchain re-org and its impact on the Bitcoin network. One participant contended that a re-org of 2000 or more blocks would be "unthinkable" due to the economic chaos it would create. They suggested that if such an event occurred, a checkpoint would likely be imposed to get everyone back onto the same chain for economic transactions. Another participant disagreed with this viewpoint, stating that the hard fork would begin when the first block over 1MB is mined, not at the triggering block. They also asked if there were any plans in place for a "hastily imposed checkpoint" scenario. A third participant responded, saying that nothing about a hard fork should be considered an emergency as there is time to prepare a safe and responsible way to upgrade the network without unilaterally declaring obsolescence.</p>
