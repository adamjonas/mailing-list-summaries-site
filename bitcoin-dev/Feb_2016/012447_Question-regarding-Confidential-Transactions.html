    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is a response to a query regarding the possibility of including the blinding factor in the extra data incorporated into the ring signatures used in the range proof. It explains that both sides can generate the blinding factors and fake signatures used in the rangeproof, with the sender embedding the amount into one of the fake signatures using XOR. The receiver, knowing the seed for the PRNG, could observe which ones are real and thereby know the digits of the amount. However, if the receiver did it this way, it would not be possible to embed any other data into the range proof using XOR. The sender would have to know the recipient's unhashed public key to do an ECDH. Normal Bitcoin transactions are made to the hash of a public key because once the public key is known, it becomes easier to break it if we ever develop quantum computers.</p>
