    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The assumption that miners are only interested in short term profit is naive, as they also consider long term ROI. Some miners might mine at a loss if they believe it will benefit the network in the long run. Following the last halving in 2012, the hashing rate decreased by less than 10% even without an immediate price increase. A debate around increasing the block size limit to 2MB was discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. The proposal suggested a 75% threshold for approval of the upgrade, with the reasoning that a higher threshold gives "veto power" to a single big solo miner or mining pool. However, a 20% miner could still veto the upgrade under the 75% threshold by voting for an upgrade and then not mining on the new chain. This would leave 55% mining the new 2MB chain and 45% of hashpower remaining on the old chain, resulting in minimal difference in block times. In a single difficulty adjustment period, the difficulty of mining a block on either chain would be identical. Even if the value of a 1MB branch coin is $100 and the hashrate on the 1 MB branch is 100 PH/s, and the value of a 2 MB branch coin is $101 and the hashrate on the 2 MB branch is 1000 PH/s, the rational thing for a miner to do is to mine on the 2 MB branch, because the miner would earn 1% more on that branch. If 25% of the hashrate chooses to remain on the minority version during the grace period, and 20% chooses to switch back to the minority side, the fork happens. One branch has 1 MB blocks every 22 minutes, and the other branch has 2 MB blocks every 18 minutes. The first branch cannot handle the pre-fork transaction volume, as it only has 45% of the capacity that it had pre-fork. The second one can, as it has 111% of the pre-fork capacity. This makes the 1 MB branch much less usable than the 2 MB branch, which in turn causes the market value of newly minted coins on that branch to fall, which in turn causes miners to switch to the more profitable 2MB branch. Basically, any miners who stick to the minority branch are going to lose a lot of money.</p>
