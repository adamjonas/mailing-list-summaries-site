    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, there is a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Yifu Guo on the adoption of Bitcoin core release and the time frame for its upgrade. Gavin believes that a grace period of 28 days is enough for upgrading to the new release, while Yifu argues that it may take longer. Gavin's statement is based on his survey of infrastructure providers and the btcd lead developer. However, Yifu's comment is empirical evidence that shows otherwise. It is frustrating to read Gavin's comments as he seems to ignore Yifu's direct questions. The discussion also involves Luke Dashjr, who warns about the risk of an attack by renting hashing power to build a fake chain and confirms that there will be zero percentage of hash power left on the weaker branch of the fork.</p>
