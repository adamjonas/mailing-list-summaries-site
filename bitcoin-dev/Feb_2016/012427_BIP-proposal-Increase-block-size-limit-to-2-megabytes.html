    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Yifu Guo and another individual, it was mentioned that there are a total of 406 nodes that fall under the unmaintained category, which is below 10% of the network. The individual also shared a link to Luke's data that shows similar results. The individual stated that even if the number of nodes shrank by 60%, there would be no issues as SPV nodes would still have no problem finding a full node to connect to, full nodes would not have any problem connecting to each other, and we would not be significantly more vulnerable to Sybil attacks or "governments get together and try to ban running a full node" attacks. The individual was informed that people were committing to spinning up thousands of supports-2mb-nodes during the grace period. However, when asked to elaborate on where they got this figure and who these people are, the individual stated that these were private communications and that they will discourage and publicly condemn anybody who runs 'pseudo nodes' or plans to spin up lots of nodes to try to influence the debate. The only legitimate reason to run extra nodes is to fill in a possible gap in total node count that might be caused by old, unmaintained nodes that stop serving blocks because the rest of the network has upgraded.Lastly, the individual stated that the adoption curve for a new major release is exponential, with lots of adoption in the first 30 days or so, then it rapidly tapers off. They expect the adoption curve for the 2mb bump to be steeper than we've ever seen, and their best guess is that 70-80% of nodes will upgrade within 30 days of the miner voting hitting 50% of blocks and triggering the automatic 'version obsolete; upgrade required' warning. Waiting a year may bring an additional 10-20% increase in adoption.</p>
