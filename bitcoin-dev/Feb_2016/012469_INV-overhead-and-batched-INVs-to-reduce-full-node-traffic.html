    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on Feb 25, 2016, Gregory Maxwell reported that the batching feature in versions 0.10 and 0.12 of a certain software was temporarily affected, but has since been fully functional again. This feature enables the ability to batch many transactions per INV effectively. The response was prompted by examination of 0.11-series versions which rarely send out INV batches. In this examination, it was noted that about 85% of the packets had a single hash. The benefits of this improvement were acknowledged. No other details were provided in the context.</p>
