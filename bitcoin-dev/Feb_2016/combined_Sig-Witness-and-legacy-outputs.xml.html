        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>TierNolan introduced the concept of extended transaction information in a BIP, which involved including the scriptPubKey being spent along with transactions to facilitate local verification. The extended transaction would contain the current transaction and the CTxOuts that are being spent. Each entry in the UTXO set could store UTXO_hash = hash(txid_parent | n | CTxOut). Witness transactions could include the CTxOut for each input that isn't a segregated witness output as part of the witness data.At a conference, there was a suggestion to have the witness data include information about the block height/index of the output that each input is spending. By implementing this change, nodes would only need to store the UTXO_hashes for each UTXO value in the database, making it more efficient. This approach would also simplify the creation of a consensus library, allowing it to return the UTXO_hashes that are spent, created, the fee, sigops, and anything that needs to be summed when given the transaction and the witness.Validating a block would primarily involve validating the transactions in the block and adding up the totals. Including the information with transactions saves each node from having to include a lookup table to find the data, thereby optimizing the process.</p>
