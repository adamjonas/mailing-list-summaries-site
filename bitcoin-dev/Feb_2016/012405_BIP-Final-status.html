    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are seeing some updates, with proposed changes to the status of several BIPs. The update is currently being discussed on GitHub and includes changes such as updating the status of Accepted BIPs to Final. Among the BIPs included in the proposal are M-of-N Standard Transactions, Protocol Version and User Agent, URI Scheme, and Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. The proposal has been open for a week, and it's expected to be merged within the next week unless there are objections. Another proposal seeks to upgrade five additional BIPs from Draft to Final status, and the champions of these proposals have been called upon to provide their ACKs. The BIPs include March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem, Fixed Length "version" Message (Relay-Transactions Field), getutxo message, Strict DER signatures, and Use "Accept" header for response type negotiation with Payment Request URLs.</p>
