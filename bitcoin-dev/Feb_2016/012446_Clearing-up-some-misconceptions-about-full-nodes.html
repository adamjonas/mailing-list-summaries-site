    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about running full nodes on desktop systems, Patrick Shirkey expressed concerns regarding the viability of running a full node on a system that is also used for other purposes. He believes that bitcoin-qt consumes a lot of CPU/GPU resources which can be problematic for users who have to share their system resources between normal desktop workload and running a full node. However, this statement was challenged by Sean who stated that when running a full node in non-mining mode, the CPU load is fairly light and the GPU is not touched at all. Sean further added that Bitcoin is tolerant of nodes entering and leaving the network at will and even part-time nodes help to improve the quality of the network. In terms of the move to 2MB hard fork, every node will need to upgrade. The rollout effect of the hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is difficult to plan in advance and relying solely on press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes is not viable, as per Sean. Hard forks are not done on a whim and it is important to learn from the past experiences.</p>
