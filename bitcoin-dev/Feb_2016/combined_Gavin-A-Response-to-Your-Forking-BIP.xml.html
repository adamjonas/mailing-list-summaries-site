        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In February 2016, Gavin Andresen expressed skepticism about Bitcoin Core's segregated witness feature. He stated that 28 days is not enough time to roll out new binaries and suggested a hard-fork may be necessary to increase capacity. In response, Bryan from Bitcoin Core argued in favor of segregated witness, citing its voluntary, mutually backwards-compatible nature and the benefits it provides. He also mentioned ecosystem buy-in and support for segregated witness, as well as a segwit testnet for developers to investigate and develop against. Bryan questioned why users would be more willing to upgrade when a certain percentage of hashpower sets a flag in a block and suggested a data-driven approach and rigorous planning process would be necessary for any hard-fork attempt. Bryan provided links to various resources defining soft-forks, hard-forks, and generalized soft-forks, as well as articles discussing their security and potential impacts on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Overall, the email exchange highlighted a debate within the Bitcoin community regarding the best approach to increasing capacity and implementing new features.</p>
