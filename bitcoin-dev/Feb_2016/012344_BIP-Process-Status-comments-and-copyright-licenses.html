    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Luke Dashjr, a member of the Bitcoin-dev community has made some changes to the BIP 2. The changes aim for less hard feelings during comments without excessive policy structure. According to BIP 2, a process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list, and there is a mix of wiki and mailing list. It would be nice for a BIP author to gather new/edited comment titles and report them to bitcoin-dev once a week, during review. Someone has to stare at the diffs. Mediawiki offers watchlists on a polling model, and there is some email support but BIP 2 should ask that all current and future forums that BIP authors might choose for review have indisputable records of moderation and user edits.Furthermore, there is a discussion about whether dump.bitcoin.it is sufficient public record of contentious moderation or user cross-comment editing. It seems like as long as the wiki as a whole is verifiable, it would suffice.</p>
