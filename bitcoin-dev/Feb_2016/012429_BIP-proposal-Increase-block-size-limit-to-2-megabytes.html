    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is discussing the idea of what constitutes an 'unmaintained' node for the Bitcoin network. They had previously considered nodes using version 0.10 as unmaintained due to the length of time since the 0.11 release. However, they note that the Gentoo package manager still has 0.10.2 as the most recent stable version, and those who regularly update their software will likely still be using it. The author questions the utility of adding more nodes to the network, suggesting that a reduction in decentralization is the primary concern with decreasing full node counts. They also express concern about the percentage of the economy dependent on trusting full nodes and the overall integrity of that trust. Finally, the author expresses skepticism about promises of additional nodes or infrastructure testing for supporting larger block sizes, noting that talk is cheap and actual implementation may not match promises.</p>
