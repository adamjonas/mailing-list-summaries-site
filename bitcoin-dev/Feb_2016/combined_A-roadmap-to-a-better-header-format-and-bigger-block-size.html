        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about improving the header format and increasing the block size for Bitcoin, developer Matt Corallo supports a proposal to implement changes in stages. However, he suggests that only one hardfork should be scheduled at a time to avoid complications. Corallo agrees with most of the proposal but wants to spend more time considering Luke-Jr's header changes and also suggests adding timewarp fixes for enhanced safety and reduced disruption. It is important to note that any client designed for stage 2 should also be ready for stage 3.Another developer on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, jl2012, proposed a 2-3 year roadmap with three stages of rule changes. Stage 1 is Segregated Witness (BIP141), which will not break any existing full or light nodes. This stage may happen in Q2-Q3 2016. Stage 2 includes fixes that will break existing full nodes but not light nodes, which may occur in Q1-Q2 2017. Stage 3 involves fixes that will break all existing full and light nodes and may take place in 2018 to 2019. An alternative roadmap suggests implementing stage 2, which will break existing full nodes and light nodes, mid-2017 or later, and stage 3, which will fix the time warp attack, in 2018 to 2019. The second proposal is considered safer in terms of safety, but the first proposal is less disruptive. It is emphasized that it is the responsibility of miners, not developers, to confirm that the supermajority of the community accepts changes in stages 2 and 3.The proposed roadmap aims to improve the header format and block size over a 2-3 year period. The objectives include making multistage rule changes, making mining easier without breaking existing hardware and the Stratum protocol, and minimizing disruption during future hardforks. Stage 1, Segregated Witness (BIP141), will not break any existing full or light nodes. Stage 2 includes several fixes that will break existing full nodes but not light nodes, such as increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and adding anti-DoS rules for non-segwit scripts. Stage 3 involves changes that will break all existing full and light nodes, including changing the header format to Luke-Jr's proposal, reclaiming unused bits in the header for mining, and fixing the time warp attack.Both proposals have their pros and cons. The first proposal offers longer upgrade times for light nodes, opt-in stages for full and light nodes, and not following the minority chain during stage 2. However, it also has the drawback of non-upgraded nodes following the old chain during stages 2 and 3, which may result in lower value. The alternative roadmap presents pros such as opt-in stages for everyone and not following the minority chain during stage 2. However, it also has the downside of a longer implementation time for stage 2 and non-upgraded nodes following the old chain during stage 3.It is reiterated that miners have a responsibility to confirm that the supermajority of the community accepts changes in stages 2 and 3. The proposals by Matt Corallo and Luke-Jr are referenced for further information.</p>
