    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is grateful that despite the editor's initial disagreement, his proposal BIP 74 was ultimately accepted. The process worked well with deep vetting and lots of back and forth, and the editor put aside his personal opinions to accept the BIP. However, the mailing list remains a problem as the author is still on moderation-only and does not know if his messages will go through or when they will. While he understands the desire to keep the conversation level high, it seems centralized and discouraging when whitelisted people can post multiple heated arguments publicly while others cannot respond. The author agrees with Gavin about the proposed commenting BIP, stating that putting more decision power behind a moderated mailing list and wiki is not a good idea. Finally, Pieter Wuille notes that comments on a feature are personal opinions on the feature itself and should not affect the acceptance of a BIP as long as the criteria are satisfied. Wallets do not have to implement a BIP even if it is accepted.</p>
