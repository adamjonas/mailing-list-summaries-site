    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Tom Zander and Jorge Timón, shared on February 6, 2016, discusses the issue of nodes getting kicked out of the network and its impact on their users. According to Zander, a node that is old will stop receiving new blocks, which means that funds won't get confirmed. However, Timón argues that being lost from the network can be a problem for users as they might end up confirming a fraudulent payment without realizing it. This situation could happen when an attacker confirms a large payment through multiple blocks, making it seem legitimate. As a result, people might hand over titles to houses or other valuable assets, assuming that the transaction is irreversible.</p>
