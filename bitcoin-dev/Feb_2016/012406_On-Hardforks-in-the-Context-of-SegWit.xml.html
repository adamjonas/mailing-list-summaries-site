    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The segregated witness discount has been changed from 75% to 50%, while the block size limit which includes transactions and witness/2 has been set at 1.5MB. This results in a maximum block size of 3MB and a "network-upgraded" block size of approximately 2.1MB. The purpose of this change is to continue to offer a discount on script data, which is kept out of the UTXO set, while ensuring that the maximum-sized block remains limited.It is unclear what the rationale for offering a discount is, but there may be an economic basis for setting the original discount at 75%. It is also unknown whether there are specific boundary limits for the discount, such as 50% - 75% or 40% - 80%.Overall, these changes aim to balance the need for efficient use of block space with the desire to keep fees low and maintain the security of the network.</p>
