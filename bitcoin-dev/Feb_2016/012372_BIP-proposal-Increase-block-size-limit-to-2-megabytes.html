    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 6, 2016, Gavin Andresen via bitcoin-dev suggested creating a security considerations section for consensus rules change and asked Adam Back what should be included. In response, Peter Todd referred to his blog post on the security considerations unique to hard-forks. Todd added that exchange, library, wallet, pool, stats server, hardware providers are testing the changes themselves, and there is a list of tested clients available on the Classic home page. Andresen expressed concern regarding the testing being conducted and whether any concrete testing was actually done. Andresen also inquired about rollback contingency plans in case of false voting or unanticipated events. Todd mentioned that voting in this BIP is only done by miners, and it cannot be faked. He further asserted that two coins would be separate currencies and could trade against each other in a 75%/25% split, making it easy for the price to diverge and hashing power to move. Todd pointed out that millions of dollars of Bitcoin were voting against the fork on the proof-of-stake voting site Bitcoinocracy.com. Todd stated that services like statoshi.info will do the monitoring and miners, people, and businesses will manage the network.</p>
