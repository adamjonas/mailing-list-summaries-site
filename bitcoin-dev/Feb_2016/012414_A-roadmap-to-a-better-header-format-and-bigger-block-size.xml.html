    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed roadmap is presented to improve the header format and block size over a period of 2-3 years. The objectives are to make multistage rule changes, make mining easier without breaking existing hardware and the Stratum protocol, and making future hardfork less disruptive. Stage 1 is Segregated Witness (BIP141), which will not break any existing full or light nodes. Stage 2 includes several fixes that will break existing full nodes but not light nodes, such as increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, adding anti-DoS rules for non-segwit scripts, and moving segwit's commitments to the Merkle tree. Stage 3 includes fixes that will break all existing full and light nodes and involves changing the header format to Luke-Jr's proposal, reclaiming unused bits in the header for mining, and fixing the time warp attack.Pros of the roadmap include longer upgrade times for light nodes, opt-in stages for full and light nodes, and not following the minority chain during stage 2. Cons include non-upgraded nodes following the old chain during stages 2 and 3, which may have lower value. An alternative roadmap is also presented, with pros including opt-in stages for everyone and not following the minority chain during stage 2. However, cons include the longer implementation time for stage 2 and non-upgraded nodes following the old chain during stage 3.It is emphasized that miners have a responsibility to confirm that the supermajority of the community accept changes in stages 2 and 3. Matt Corallo's and Luke-Jr's proposals are referenced.</p>
