    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author discusses the potential impact of implementing segregated witness on hardforking blocksize increases in Bitcoin. They suggest that if segwit is successful, a hardfork may need to trade off an increase in blocksize with a decrease in the witness discount, and without segwit, alternative changes would be needed to prevent hashing large amounts of data when checking signatures or reducing worst-case UTXO growth. The author does not believe that fees will rise significantly or that there will be a "fee event" due to spam attacks, but suggests having a backup plan in case of major issues with segwit. They propose that Gavin's BIP, which includes an increase to ~2MB coupled with accurate counting and limiting of sighash bytes, could be a good technical backup plan if segwit proves too difficult to deploy safely. However, they acknowledge that this may not be acceptable politically and offer suggestions for making it workable, including a higher level of supermajority and a longer voting period. They emphasize that these are just hobbyist suggestions and do not have any backchannel contacts in mining or bitcoin startups.</p>
