        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email proposes an implementation of the "nuclear option" soft fork, which involves adding fields to header 3 that can be expanded later. This would save having to make the merkle tree a sum tree immediately and allow separate sum-trees for each counter (sigops, block size, tx count, sighash?). The email also recommends having dedicated hard fork and soft fork counters, as well as a field for parallel soft forks. Nodes would react to hard forks by stalling the chain, and the hard fork counter means that the new rules could be that nodes should do that going forward for all new hard forks.Luke Dashjr has shared a draft BIP for Pre-BIP Growth Soft-hardfork, which aims to deploy proper merge-mining as suggested by Satoshi, expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip and providing a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes vulnerable to attack. The first implementation of the BIP might be painful, but it will make future hardforks easier. The proposal suggests including the median timestamp of the past 11 blocks after the block height in coinbase to make it easier to use it as an activation threshold of consensus rule changes. It also proposes to treat witness commitment as a merge mined commitment. Miners are emphasized to ensure that the hardfork is accepted by the supermajority of the economy. The author wrote a draft BIP a year ago which aims to accomplish certain important goals, including deploying proper merge-mining as suggested by Satoshi, expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip, and providing a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes vulnerable to attack. The author plans to revise and complete the BIP soon and welcomes suggestions for doing so. In summary, the proposed implementations aim to make hardforks safer and more efficient, with less risk of leaving old nodes vulnerable to attack. Dashjr's draft BIP focuses on deploying proper merge-mining and providing a safe way to deploy hardforks. The author's draft BIP also aims to accomplish these goals and is currently being revised.</p>
