    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on February 12, 2016, the possibility of creating a new opcode for an altcoin was discussed. However, it was later determined that the altcoin would only accept standard output scripts. This led to the suggestion of paying to a non-standard script instead, which was seen as an improvement over the previous method of cut and choose. However, it was noted that this approach would only work for coins that allow non-standard scripts (referred to as type 2 in BIP). The focus then shifted to maintaining standard scripts on the altcoin.</p>
