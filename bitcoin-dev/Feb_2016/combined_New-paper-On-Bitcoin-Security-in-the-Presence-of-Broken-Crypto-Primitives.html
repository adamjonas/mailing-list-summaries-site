        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Digital currencies like Bitcoin heavily rely on cryptographic primitives for their operation. However, these primitives may not last forever and can break due to increased computational power and advanced cryptanalysis. Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate such breakage to maintain trust in a cryptocurrency. The article provides the first systematic analysis of the effect of broken primitives on Bitcoin by identifying the core cryptographic building blocks and analyzing the various ways in which they can break, and the subsequent effect on the main Bitcoin security guarantees.The analysis reveals that the effects of broken primitives on Bitcoin can range from minor privacy violations to a complete breakdown of the currency, depending on the primitive and type of breakage. The article then suggests several observations and recommendations for Bitcoin migration plans in case of broken cryptographic primitives. It emphasizes the need for designing a system that can handle changing algorithms and the importance of a transparent and timely response to any potential threats.This analysis is based on a paper published on International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), which is available at <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/167">https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/167</a>.</p>
