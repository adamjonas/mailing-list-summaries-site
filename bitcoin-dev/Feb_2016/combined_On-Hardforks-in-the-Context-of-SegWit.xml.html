        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin community has largely agreed that the block size limit should be increased to around 2MB, either through Segregated Witness or a hard fork. Most of the community also supports the implementation of SegWit in the near future and acknowledges that hard forks will eventually become necessary. However, there has been no serious discussion on what a hard fork would look like in the context of SegWit.A proposed outline for a hard fork involves changing the segregated witness discount from 75% to 50%, setting the block size limit at 1.5MB, limiting scriptPubKeys to 100 bytes and prohibiting OP_CODESEPARATOR, and requiring push-only scriptSigs. The hard fork proposal is intended to activate only with clear and broad consensus across the community. There is potential for optimization if brute-forcing the SHA256 midstate, but these changes may not be compatible with Luke-Jr's soft-hardfork approach.Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed a hard fork to follow SegWit. He suggests four changes: increasing the block size limit to 1.5MB, reducing the segregated witness discount to 50%, limiting transactions to contain up to 20 non-segwit inputs, and relaxing the rule requiring the first four bytes of the previous block hash field to be zeroes. These changes aim to reduce the cost to validate while making bitcoin mining hardware production easier and more competitive. However, there are still concerns about the risks involved in a hard fork, especially in the presence of strife. It is also suggested that optimizing the midstate should be examined closely. Additionally, there is concern about relay networking scaling above 2MB per block prior to IBLT/weak-blocks/whatever. Making merge-mining easier and splitting the proof of work between something visible to miners and something only visible to pool operators could help reduce the number of hard forks visible to lightweight clients.</p>
