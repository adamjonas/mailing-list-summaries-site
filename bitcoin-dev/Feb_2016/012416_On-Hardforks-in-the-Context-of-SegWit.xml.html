    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion about a hard fork in the context of segwit has been initiated. The proposal involves changing the segregated witness discount from 75% to 50%, setting the block size limit (ie transactions + witness/2) to 1.5MB and allowing for a maximum block size of 3MB with a "network-upgraded" block size of roughly 2.1MB. The proposal aims to decrease the worst-case scenario, while keeping the total size in-line with what the network could handle. The cost to validate and prevent significant blowups is also addressed, with transactions being allowed up to 20 non-segwit inputs and MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS potentially becoming a per-transaction limit. Additionally, the first four bytes of the previous block hash field may contain any value instead of requiring them to be 0s, which would make it easier to produce competitive hardware. Alternatives such as using leading non-zero bytes of the prevhash as additional nonce were also discussed.</p>
