    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jorge Timón, a contributor to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), has suggested finding another term for "consensus" in the BIP document. He claims that the overuse of "consensus" in various contexts has caused confusion between different concepts. In the BIP99, he used "uncontroversial" as an alternative to "consensus," but he is open to changing it to something else. Meanwhile, he suggests renaming "consensus rules/code" to "concord rules/code" to clarify the difference between the actual process by which humans agree on changes and the criteria for those changes. Luke-Jr, the author of the BIP document, agrees with Timón and suggests that "concord rules/code" would be a good replacement. The proposed changes are trivial as there are only 249 instances of "consensus" in the Core document.</p>
