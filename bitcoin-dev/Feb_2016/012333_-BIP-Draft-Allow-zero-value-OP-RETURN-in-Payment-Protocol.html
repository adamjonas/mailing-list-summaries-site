    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are concerns being raised about the uneven application of moderation on the Bitcoin development mailing list. One user, Toby Padilla, claims that his responses to comments made against his BIP took hours to go through, while others were able to quickly post multiple heated arguments against him. The issue was brought up by Peter Todd, who is also on moderation only in the mailing list. Todd acknowledges the desire to keep the conversation level high but notes that the current situation can be discouraging and make the process look very centralized. The entire Bitcoin development mailing list is on moderation-only, which could lead to delays in responses.</p>
