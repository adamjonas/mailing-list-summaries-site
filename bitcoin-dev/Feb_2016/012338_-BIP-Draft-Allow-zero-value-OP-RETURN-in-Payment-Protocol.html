    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context involves a discussion about the moderation process on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. There seems to be conflicting information regarding how the moderation process works and why some posts are delayed while others go through immediately. The list documentation states that first-time posts may be delayed due to "greylisting," while another post suggests that all new members are initially moderated and then cleared as they post. In response to a complaint about uneven moderation, Peter Todd explains that actual human beings need to approve posts before they can be sent out, and that moderation is necessary to manage the large volume of traffic on the list. He also notes that other mailing lists use similar methods of moderation and suggests that an unmoderated version of bitcoin-dev could be created if desired.</p>
