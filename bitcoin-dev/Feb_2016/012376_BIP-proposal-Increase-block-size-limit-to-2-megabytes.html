    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, Gavin Andresen raised the issue of thousands of 2MB support nodes being spun up during the grace period and questioned why an attacker wouldn't be able to counter-sybil-attack that effort. He also asked who these people were. In response, Gavin asked Blockstream if they would help by running a dozen or two extra full nodes, but reminded everyone that Bitcoin Core does not condone participation in network attacks to push controversial protocol changes through. Sybil attacks can prevent nodes from finding peers with accurate information about what blockchains exist, which is why users need sufficient time to actively opt-in to protocol changes.</p>
