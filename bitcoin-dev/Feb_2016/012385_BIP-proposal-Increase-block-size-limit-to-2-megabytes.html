    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, the debate over BIP gets lost due to sniping at each other about known disagreements. People are asking why Gavin isn't picking 95% in his BIP, given there are many better alternatives even if you don't think you can get ~100% hashing power support. A simpler alternative is suggested, where a hashing power activated change with a threshold of 99% or higher is used with a minimum activation date some point reasonably far into the future. Peter Todd suggests that the grace period adds significant complexity to the implementation and that a simple high % miner consensus fork with a reasonable minimum activation time avoids all these problems with far less code complexity. Additionally, he highlights that the way the grace period is implemented means that if support drops after 75% is reached, the hardfork still activates which could be dangerous.</p>
