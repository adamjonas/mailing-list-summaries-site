    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Gavin Andresen was asked about the possibility of "flag day" or "flag block" as an alternative coordination mechanism to miners producing up-version blocks. He explained that these mechanisms were possible and provided no specific reason why he decided against them. When asked about security considerations, Andresen replied that there were no differences from other consensus rules changes and offered to write a blog post summarizing their slack discussion of SPV security. Regarding testing for the change, he mentioned that it is being conducted by exchange, library, wallet, and other providers themselves and provided a link to the Classic home page where a list of tested providers could be found. When asked about a rollback plan in case the hard-fork triggers via false voting, Andresen noted that the only voting is done by miners which cannot be faked. He also discussed the possibility of Sybil attacks and suggested that Blockstream could help by running extra full nodes. Finally, when probed on how security would be monitored and managed through the hard-fork, Andresen said that he had no plan since the Bitcoin network is self-monitoring and self-managing.</p>
