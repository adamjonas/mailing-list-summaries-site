    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Segwit is a change in the rules regarding the Transaction data structure and requires work from exchanges, wallets, and services for adoption. In contrast, a blocksize increase is a change to the Block structure. Most wallets are block agnostic, and if a client has been built using a library that abstracts away the block, then the client's code does not need to be updated to handle this block size limit change. Wallets using Bitcore have to work alongside a blockchain API, such as Node API, which needs to be based on a Node that follows the upgraded chain. A blockchain service, such as a block explorer, only needs to upgrade their node software so that the MAX_BLOCKSIZE parameter is set to 2MB. This can be done by either changing the source code themselves or installing an alternate client such as XT, Classic, or Unlimited.On February 6, 2016, Adam Back via bitcoin-dev wrote to Gavin Andresen, stating that it would probably be a good idea to have a security considerations section and asking whether there was a list of which exchange, library, wallet, pool, stats server, hardware, etc. he had tested this change against. He also asked about a rollback plan in the event the hard-fork triggers via false voting and how they planned to monitor and manage security through the hard-fork. Gavin responded that he surveyed several of the biggest infrastructure providers and the btcd lead developer, and they all agreed "28 days is plenty of time" for individuals to download and restart their bitcoind or patch and then re-run.Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev suggested putting the blog post on a couple of the constants chosen in the BIP's Rationale section and asked whether scripts should commit to the total accurate-sigop count to fix static analysis entirely. Gavin replied that multisignature signing would become more complicated for zero benefit if scripts committed to a total accurate sigop count. He also added words about economic majority and removed a controversial sentence from the draft.In the short term, an increase is needed to continue current economic policies with regards to fees and block space, matching market expectations and preventing market disruption. SPV wallets are compatible with this change, and any hardfork should address at least the simple tasks on the hardfork wishlist and be deployed as a soft-hardfork so as not to leave old nodes entirely insecure.</p>
