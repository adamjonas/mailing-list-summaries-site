    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list centered around the issue of whether a company's terms of service should include their position on providing access to coins on every single fork. Some users argued that custodial wallet users are entitled to all forks including Clam, Zcash, and Decred while others stated that supporting the obsolete chain is unnecessary and has not been offered in any cryptocurrency hard fork before. The debate also veered towards the legal implications of custodians failing to produce coins on both sides of a fork and how it could amount to theft of their customersâ€™ funds. However, some participants suggested that the thread should focus on the technical merits of the BIP and discussions on hard forks would be better held elsewhere.</p>
