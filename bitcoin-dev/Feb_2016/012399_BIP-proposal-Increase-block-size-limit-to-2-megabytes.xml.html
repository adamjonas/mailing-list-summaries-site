    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The debate on the proposed bitcoin hard fork has been ongoing for many months and the upgrade pace is expected to be significantly faster due to the "upgrade or be kicked off the network" situation. There will also be alerts sent out to prompt people to take action. The adoption speed of the hard fork is uncertain but it is believed to be faster than previous instances. 28 days have been proposed as a grace period which some argue may not be long enough, but infrastructure providers and the btcd lead developer consider it sufficient time. However, some are concerned that picking such a short timeline may alienate nodes who do not upgrade in time. In the event of an attack by someone with hashing power on the weaker branch of the fork, there may be literally zero miners left on the weaker branch since soft-fork adoption by miners is typically very quick from 75% to over 95%.</p>
