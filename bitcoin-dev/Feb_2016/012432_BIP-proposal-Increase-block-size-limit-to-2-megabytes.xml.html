    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, David Vorick raised a question about the utility of having more nodes on the Bitcoin network. He suggested that perhaps concerns over SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) nodes not getting enough bandwidth or the network struggling from the load could be the reason for wanting more nodes. It was pointed out in response that when pruning is activated, the NODE_NETWORK bit is cleared, which means that supporting SPV clients requires running full nodes without pruning. However, it was also mentioned that a pruning node could still support SPV clients that sync more often than once every few days if it stores a few GB of block data.</p>
