    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>There are some misconceptions about full nodes that need to be cleared up. The first myth is that there are only around 5,500 full nodes worldwide, which is derived from websites like bitnodes.21.co that measure open ports for probing. However, not all nodes have open ports due to firewalls or configuration changes, meaning the number is likely much higher. Open-port nodes upload blocks to new full nodes and are useful in measuring bandwidth capacity but don't matter more than closed-port nodes when it comes to trust, security, and privacy.Another myth is that there's no incentive to run nodes, and the network relies on altruism. However, using a full node as a wallet is the only way to ensure that none of Bitcoin's rules have been broken, and it increases security by providing checks against possible attacks. Full node wallets are also currently the most private way to use Bitcoin, with no other parties learning which Bitcoin addresses belong to the user. To get the benefits of running a full node, the user should use it as their wallet, preferably on hardware they control. Using cloud servers is not recommended since bandwidth and connections are not problems today, trust, security, and privacy are. While advice in 2012 suggested using lightweight clients instead of full nodes, the full node software has vastly improved in terms of user experience since then. There are several ways to run a full node as a wallet, including running bitcoin-qt, using wallet software backed by a full node, or using a lightweight wallet that connects only to the user's full node.</p>
