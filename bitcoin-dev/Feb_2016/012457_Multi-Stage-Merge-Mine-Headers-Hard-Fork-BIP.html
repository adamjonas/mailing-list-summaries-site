    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A draft proposal for a two-stage hard fork to implement changes to the Bitcoin header format has been submitted by James Hilliard on GitHub. The first stage would use merge mining, which would require that the pre-fork chain be mined with a generation transaction containing no new coins and no transactions. This stage would also require consensus rules that increase difficulty and hold back the original chain so that non-upgraded clients can never catch up to current time. The second stage, activated only after 50,000 blocks, would make the header format incompatible with merge mining. The proposal aims to fix issues with pooled mining and provide other desirable changes in a non-merge mine compatible way. The proposal is still in draft form and has no reference implementation yet.</p>
