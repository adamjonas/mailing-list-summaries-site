    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 6, 2016, Gavin Andresen responded to a claim that 28 days was not enough time for exchanges and others holding 3rd party coins. He stated that he surveyed several of the biggest infrastructure providers and the btcd lead developer and they all agreed that 28 days is plenty of time. However, Jannes argued that 28 days seems too short for small and big entities to start putting in massive man hours to untangle Bitcoins from classiccoins while pausing all withdrawals. They must be able to send their customers both coins as separate withdrawals or guarantee them both coins in one transaction, which is impossible. Failure to do so amounts to theft of customers' funds. Furthermore, Jannes noted that the aforementioned scenario only described honest exchanges and imagined how dishonest ones would simply steal the classiccoins from their customers and sell them for their own profit.</p>
