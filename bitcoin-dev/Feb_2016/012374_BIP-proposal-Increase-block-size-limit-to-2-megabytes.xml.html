    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-dev, Peter Todd suggested that security considerations specific to hard-forks should be included in the development of Bitcoin technology. He referred to an article he wrote for his blog and clarified that it only covered some of the unique security considerations, mainly those associated with uncontroversial hard-forks. The article did not discuss economic attacks or other security omissions. In response, Gavin Andresen questioned the need for such considerations, stating that he was not aware of any security issues that differ from regular consensus rule changes.</p>
