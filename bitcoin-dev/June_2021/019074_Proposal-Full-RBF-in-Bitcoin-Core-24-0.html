    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal is to deprecate opt-in RBF in favor of full-RBF as the default replacement policy in Bitcoin Core version 24.0, with deployment aimed a year from now assuming agreement is reached. The rationale for this change is based on ongoing and anticipated changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem. One issue with RBF opt-out is that it can be used as a DoS vector against multi-party funded transactions, affecting protocols such as Coinjoin, onchain DLCs, and dual-funded LN channels. Additionally, there is a risk of mempools malicious partitions where an attacker exploits network topology or divergence in mempools policies to partition network mempools in different subsets. To enhance 0-confs security, proactive security models such as double-spend monitoring/receiver-side fee-topping with package relay and reactive security models such as economic reputation-based compensations could be considered. Ultimately, the goal is to preserve the current interests of 0-confs users while enabling upcoming interests of fancy L2s to flourish. If there is agreement on switching to full-RBF, but 0.24 sounds too early, the proposal suggests deferring it to 0.25 or 0.26.</p>
