    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Raymo proposes a protocol called Sabu and receives feedback from ZmnSCPxj. Raymo corrects some misunderstandings about the protocol, explaining that issuers will use multiple UTXOs worth 40,000 satoshis each to earn transaction fees in the Sabu network. ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about a potential attack where an issuer aggregates multiple transactions into a single fraudulent one with lower fees, exploiting the fact that miners consider fee rate rather than absolute fee. However, Raymo argues that such an attack would require the issuer to have too many UTXOs for a single block and proposes a cap on maximum debt per transaction as a hedge against such attacks. ZmnSCPxj also notes that miners are not omniscient and can be fooled by a lower fee transaction, leading to a potentially costless attack for the issuer. In response, Raymo emphasizes the importance of the complementary protection of BIPxxx for flagging/unflagging promised UTXOs.</p>
