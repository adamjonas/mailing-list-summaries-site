        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on the GitHub platform, Ryan Grant raised awareness of the confusion surrounding the recent updates to the BIP118 draft. It appears that many individuals are unaware of the significant changes that have occurred since May 2019, including a name change to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The specific details of these revisions can be found in the "Revisions" section within the internal heading. Interestingly, the version in bitcoin/bips had remained unchanged since 2018 until it recently diverged and received a minor fix two months ago. Despite this update, it still utilizes the SIGHASH_NOINPUT terminology. However, with the activation of taproot, it is now widely believed that the preferred method for easing lightning network client state requirements will be SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The author of the message expresses confusion as to why the updated draft of BIP118 has not gained more attention from a broader audience. For further information regarding the revisions made to the draft, additional details can be found by following the provided links on the GitHub platform.</p>
