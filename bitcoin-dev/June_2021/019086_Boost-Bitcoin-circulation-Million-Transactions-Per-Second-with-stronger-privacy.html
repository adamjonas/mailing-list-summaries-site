    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation, the vulnerability of sybil attacks was addressed in the context of a consensus protocol. The consensus must be between the issuer and creditor, who are already in a web of trust connection. However, if the recipient is not connected to a valid network, double spends could be allowed, making it vulnerable to proxy attacks. While this may not be financially lucrative for transactions worth around a dollar, larger retailers need to use distributed/trusted nodes and certificates to defend against such attacks.In another discussion, a proposal was made to improve Bitcoin's TPS and privacy. The proposal suggests boosting Bitcoin circulation by achieving a million transactions per second while maintaining privacy. The links to the post and the BitcoinTalk forum were shared, and feedback was requested.</p>
