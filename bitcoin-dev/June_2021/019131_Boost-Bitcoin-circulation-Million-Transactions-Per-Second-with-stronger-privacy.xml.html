    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Raymo responds to James Hilliard's critique of his proposal for the Sabu protocol. Though Hilliard points out flaws in Raymo's assumptions about miners and mining pools, Raymo maintains that the economically rational decisions of issuers and creditors will prevent fraudulent activity. Raymo also emphasizes that Sabu will not require channels to be opened or closed and will not involve routing. Instead, only the issuer and creditor will be aware of each transaction, allowing for millions of transactions per second to be sent and received without leaving a footprint on any DLT. ZmnSCPxj also weighs in, questioning the trustworthiness of the Gazin wallet, which Raymo plans to use as an implementation of the Sabu protocol. ZmnSCPxj argues that Lightning is still superior due to its ability to achieve high global TPS and low fees while maintaining non-custodiality. Overall, the email exchange highlights the importance of trust and transparency in the development of cryptocurrency protocols.</p>
