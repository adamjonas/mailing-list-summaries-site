    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The controversy surrounding the upgrade mechanisms for the taproot upgrade has sparked a proposal for trinary version signaling. This would allow for three signaling states - actively supporting the change, actively opposing it, and not signaling at all. The proposed solution aims to release non-contentious upgrades much quicker with fewer miners signaling support. It also incentivizes lazy miners who oppose the change to update their software to actively signal opposition. However, there are differing opinions on whether activation without hash power enforcement can prevent a split.Eric Voskuil disagrees with the idea of activation without hash power enforcement as he believes that soft forks are rule changes and thereby incompatible unless enforced by majority hash power. On the other hand, Jorge Tim√≥n agrees that if different users want different incompatible things, there's no way to avoid the split but we should try to avoid it when possible because chain splits have a cost. Billy Tetrud believes that estimates can sometimes be wildly wrong, which is why multiple barriers need to be in place for an upgrade and higher thresholds of success. Luke Dashjr thinks that soft forks are coordinated between users and not miners and that no additional bit is needed as soft forks are coordinated between users, not miners.The email thread containing this discussion is from the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation. The purpose of the mailing list is to facilitate discussion and collaboration among developers working on the Bitcoin protocol. The link provided in the email allows interested individuals to sign up for the mailing list and participate in the conversation. However, it is important to follow the code of conduct when participating in discussions to ensure that they remain productive and respectful.In summary, the email thread serves as a reminder of the importance of open communication and collaboration in the development of Bitcoin. The mailing list provides a forum for developers to share ideas, ask questions, and work together to improve the protocol. By participating in the discussion and following the code of conduct, members of the community can help ensure that Bitcoin continues to grow and evolve in a positive direction.</p>
