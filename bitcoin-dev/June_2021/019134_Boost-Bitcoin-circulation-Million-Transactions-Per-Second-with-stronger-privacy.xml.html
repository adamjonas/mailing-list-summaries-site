    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Raymo proposed a new protocol called Sabu that he believes will be better than Lightning. The Sabu protocol would not require users to open or close channels and would eliminate routing, enabling transactions to be sent and received at high speeds without leaving a footprint on any DLT. However, James Hilliard pointed out that Raymo's proposal relies on economically rational decisions from both issuers and creditors and assumes miners will not build on blocks containing transactions they have not seen before, which is not practical without centralizing mining. Raymo responded by explaining that a conspiracy between a miner and a group of issuers to mine a block full of cheating transactions could result in an extra 1.2 BTC illicit income plus block coinbase income, but Hilliard argued that miners regularly change block headers and that if they do not broadcast the transactions, there would be no time limit. Moreover, Hilliard suggested that Raymo's proposal is uninteresting because it relies on trust assumptions similar to those used by custodial wallets.</p>
