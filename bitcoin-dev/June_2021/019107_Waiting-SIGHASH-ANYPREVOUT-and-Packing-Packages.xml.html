    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion thread began with Antoine Riard expressing concerns about the scalability of Bitcoin development and coordination among different layers. The participants discussed long-term roadmaps for decentralized projects like Bitcoin Core and how they could affect functionality in the future. They acknowledged that getting changes merged into Core relies on various contributors' interest and understanding of L2 protocols and encouraged patience.The discussion also involved technical issues, such as pre-signed feerate/tx-pinnings, package-relay, and blind CPFP fee bump transactions. Antoine Riard proposed solutions to these problems, such as signing the update transaction with SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT or adding a per-participant key to lockdown the transaction. However, other participants suggested caution before promoting these ideas and encouraged more detailed write-ups and discussions within the Bitcoin community.In a recent email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard discussed two potential solutions to the pre-signed feerate problem for the Lightning Network: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. While SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT may work for current LN-penalty, it may not work for eltoo. On the other hand, package-relay is a clear improvement now and may be permanent for as long as we're using anything like the current protocol.David A. Harding argued that it's not appropriate to create timelines that depend on the work of a large number of contributors who haven't been consulted. Additionally, he suggested that Riard or someone else should write up the anyprevout idea in more detail before promoting it further. Riard responded by inviting participants to make their own opinions based on different factors, such as trusting experts or gathering diverse in-field authorities' opinions. He also emphasized his belief in the hacker ethos of spreading ideas, learning from mistakes, and building better systems.</p>
