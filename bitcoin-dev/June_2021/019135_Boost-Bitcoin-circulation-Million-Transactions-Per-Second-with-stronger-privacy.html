    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Raymaot and ZmnSCPxj, Raymo explains that Sabu is a protocol that will be implemented in the Gazin wallet. The wallet will be open source and GPL3, and it will support both Android and iPhone. Raymo believes that Sabu will be far better than Lightning because it eliminates the need to open and close channels, which dramatically reduces transaction costs, increases the distribution of nodes, and improves privacy levels. Additionally, Sabu does not have routing, so only the issuer and creditor will know about transactions. However, ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about the lack of security with the 1-of-1 scheme used in Sabu. A creditor could sign an invalid transaction, and there is no way to prevent this without redesigning the whole system to use at least 2-of-2. Without trust-minimization security, features are meaningless.</p>
