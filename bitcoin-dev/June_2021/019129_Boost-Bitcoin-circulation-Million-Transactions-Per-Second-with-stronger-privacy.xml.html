    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Raymo is developing the Sabu protocol which will be implemented in Gazin, a mobile wallet that will support both Android and iPhone. The implementation will be open source under GPL3. Raymo claims that Sabu will be superior to Lightning as it does not require opening and closing channels, making transactions more cost-effective and improving node distribution and privacy levels. Additionally, Sabu has no routing and only the issuer and creditor know about the transaction, allowing for dynamic repeals without leaving any footprints on DLT. However, ZmnSCPxj questions the trustworthiness of Gazin and suggests using Coinbase instead, citing security concerns around open-source wallets. ZmnSCPxj maintains that Lightning is still superior due to its non-custodiality, high global TPS, and low fees. They also note the requirement for n-of-n to form smaller sub-moneys from the global money as a central idea of Lightning.</p>
