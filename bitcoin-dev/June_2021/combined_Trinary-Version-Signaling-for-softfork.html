        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The role of miners and full nodes in enforcing consensus rules in Bitcoin is complex and multifaceted. Consensus rules are enforced by both miners and full nodes, with full nodes validating transactions and blocks according to the rules and miners adding validated transactions to the blockchain.Soft fork signaling is often considered voting, but it is simply an indication of readiness for a soft fork. Without majority hash power support, activation of a soft fork will result in a chain split if the majority of miners decide to mine a chain that does not follow the consensus rules. Game theory can provide insight into the various outcomes possible in this scenario.Eric Voskuil recently expressed his inability to provide evidence of a valid game theoretic model applicable to Bitcoin, and clarified that mining pools and exchanges do not necessarily hold discussions before signaling for a soft fork. However, he also noted that miners can enforce censorship by not building on non-censoring blocks and that consensus rules are enforced by merchants who reject trading for something they do not consider money.Voskuil argued that nodes do not enforce the knowledge that a transaction is invalid, but Zac Greenwood disagreed, stating that nodes do enforce consensus rules and define what is Bitcoin. The two continued to debate the issue, with Greenwood explaining that the network of consensus-compatible nodes ensures that no party can transact bitcoin in a way that violates the set of rules enforced by the network.The debate over whether nodes or merchants enforce consensus rules in the Bitcoin network was recently discussed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list. One participant argued that a node (software) doesn't enforce anything, and that it is up to economic nodes – people who refuse to accept invalid money – to enforce consensus rules. However, another participant disagreed, stating that a node definitely enforces consensus rules and defines what is Bitcoin. In an email exchange between Zac Greenwood and Eric Voskuil, the topic of whether a node enforces consensus rules was debated. Voskuil argued that a node does not enforce anything, and that it is up to economic nodes to enforce consensus rules. Greenwood disagreed, stating that nodes do enforce consensus rules and define what is Bitcoin.Voskuil also responded to several questions related to Bitcoin's consensus rules and mining in another email exchange. He clarified that any two people on different rules imply a chain split, and that there is no actual concept of "the rules," just one set of rules or another. When asked about soft fork signaling, Voskuil explained that a miner can still mine whatever they want even after signaling readiness for a soft fork. However, each miner seeing the signals of others, unless they are coordinating, would presumably assume that others will enforce.Overall, these discussions highlight the complexity of enforcing consensus rules in the Bitcoin network and the different viewpoints surrounding this issue. While economic nodes play a crucial role in enforcing consensus rules by refusing to accept invalid money, non-economic nodes also contribute to the network's overall security. The debate over whether a node enforces consensus rules or not continues, with arguments being made for both sides.</p>
