        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning network has been facing safety issues, such as pre-signed feerate and malicious transaction pinnings. To address these issues, the author proposes solutions like package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT for pre-signed feerate problem, and hardening the mempool against tx-relay jammings attacks for malicious transaction pinnings. The author emphasizes the importance of considering these issues during the development process and suggests a rough deployment timeline for proposed solutions.Furthermore, the post discusses the design considerations for implementing package relay in Bitcoin Core to support advanced Bitcoin protocols such as OP_CTV congestion tree, CoinPool, and interactive cut-through. The author explains that the package relay relies on two separate components: the higher half, an extension of the mempool logic with a new package-level policy, and the lower half, which has at least three different designs. The author also proposes that feedback from L2 ecosystem users should establish API bounds for package-size acceptance logic to establish public consensus. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of carefully considering anti-DoS measures for package-relay and exploring cost-effective package replacement policies to avoid economically outlawing Lightning nodes with a small fee budget.In a recent email thread, Antoine Riard proposed two possible solutions to the pre-signed feerate issue for Lightning: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. While there are concerns about the compatibility of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT with eltoo and its potential for misuse by attackers, the package-relay solution is expected to be a permanent solution as long as the current protocol is used.However, Dave, another contributor to the email thread, expressed his disagreement with creating timelines that depend on the work of a large number of contributors without consulting them. He believes that things will get done when they get done. Overall, it is important to consider safety issues during the development process and carefully evaluate proposed solutions before implementation. The participants acknowledged the challenges of decentralized development and encouraged patience and caution before promoting new ideas.</p>
