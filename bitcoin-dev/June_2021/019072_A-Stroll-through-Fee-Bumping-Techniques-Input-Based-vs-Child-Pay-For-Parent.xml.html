    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Lloyd Fournier and Antoine Riard discuss a proposal for a single-party managed fee-bumping system that would solve all fee-bumping requirements of lightning without needing external utxos and without additional interaction or fee pre-agreement between parties. Riard raises concerns about trust issues related to the effective feerate to use at some unknown time point in the future. Fournier claims that his proposal is a single-party managed fee-bumping system that would solve all fee-bumping requirements of lightning without needing external utxos and without additional interaction or fee pre-agreement between parties. However, he later realizes that the proposal is not as attractive due to the complexity involved in determining who owns certain outputs in lightning until the most-recent-state-enforcement mechanism has done its job.</p>
