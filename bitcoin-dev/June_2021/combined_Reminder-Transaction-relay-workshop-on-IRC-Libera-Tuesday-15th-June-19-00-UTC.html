        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A workshop on transaction relay is scheduled to take place tomorrow on the #l2-onchain-support Libera chat from 19:00 UTC to 20:30 UTC. The workshop will cover topics such as "Guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design," "Coordinated cross-layers security disclosures," and "Full-RBF proposal." Notes and open questions for the first two topics can be found on GitHub, while the "Move toward full-rbf" proposal will soon have its own thread.The aim of the workshop is to foster knowledge sharing among attendees and reach rough consensus about expected goals. Those interested in attending include second-layer protocol designers, Lightning devs, Bitcoin Core devs contributing around mempool/p2p areas, or Bitcoin service operators with intense usage of the mempool. It is important to note that the workshop will take place on Libera, not Freenode.</p>
