    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Raymo proposes that rational users will act in their best interest to make a profit from the Sabu protocol. The system is designed to prevent irrational actors, such as those who might harm others and themselves. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj argues that every trust-minimized offchain system requires 2-of-2, where somebody else has to countercheck the validity of a protocol that is not directly on the blockchain. He states that the point is a single signer can sign anything, including a transaction that is neither an MT nor a GT but has arbitrary numbers that are neither a valid GT nor a valid MT. This means that it is a trusted system where every creditor trusts every issuer to only sign GTs and MTs, which makes it uninteresting. Finally, he argues that the UX will be fairly awful because the largest safe payment will vary depending on on-chain mempool state, and if the mempool is almost empty, the largest safe payment will be much smaller than at other times.</p>
