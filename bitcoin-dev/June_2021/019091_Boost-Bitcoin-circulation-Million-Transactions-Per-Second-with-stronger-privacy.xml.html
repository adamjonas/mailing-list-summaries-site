    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about mining, the assumption is made that corrupted miners would have a low chance of finding the next block due to their small size and lack of benefits. However, it is pointed out that as long as the block passes the consensus rules, all miners will mine on top of it by default. The idea of implementing a BIP to eliminate the possibility of accepting fraudulent blocks is discussed but deemed unlikely to work in a decentralized way. It is noted that miners have different mempool policies for what transactions they themselves mine, but must all mine on the most work chain of valid blocks to avoid having their own blocks orphaned. When a new transaction is broadcast, there can be significant latency before miners switch to mining on top of it due to batch updates of stratum templates/jobs done by mining pools for network efficiency reasons.</p>
