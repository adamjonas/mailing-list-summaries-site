    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses various aspects related to fee-bumping techniques in Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Revault. The discussion touches upon the use of keys, key management complexities, security concerns, and tradeoffs associated with fee-bumping reserves. Regarding the use of keys, it is suggested that for Revault, a key could be introduced for each watchtower in the vaults descriptors. However, this could break the replication model. On the other hand, for Lightning, it is mentioned that the descriptor can quickly become convoluted, requiring knowledge of which watchtower or node would be willing to feebump. The purpose of the finalizing key is also discussed, which aims to finalize the transaction state once another fee-bumping input has been attached. It is clarified that this key does not secure funds and can be shared with any fee-bumper entity. The discussion then moves on to the tradeoffs associated with fee-bumping reserves, highlighting the need to keep channels unbalanced if running on fractional fee-bumping reserves. The use of anchor is suggested as a way to rebalance a security matter. Finally, the discussion touches upon input-based bumping, which targets the tail of the chain at the transaction level. However, it is noted that bounded visibility of network mempools could make CPFP irrelevant for propagation.</p>
