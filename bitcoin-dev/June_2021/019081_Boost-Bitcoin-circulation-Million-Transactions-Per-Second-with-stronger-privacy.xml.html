    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>An individual named Raymo has proposed a plan to improve Bitcoin transactions per second (TPS) and privacy. The proposal includes implementing an off-chain transaction network that allows for faster and more private transactions. Raymo believes that this system would be ideal for small transactions, as it is lightning-fast and has no routing protocols. Moreover, everything is guaranteed by relative fees and the cost-of-theft. Raymo's proposal can be found in detail on his Medium post and Bitcointalk forum. He has requested feedback on his proposal and thoughts from the community. The Bitcoin-dev mailing list has received this request, and many members may provide their opinions and ideas regarding the proposal.</p>
