    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>During a recent Bitcoin workshop, fee-sensitive timelocks were discussed as a potential solution to increase the resilience of the Lightning Network (LN) to temporary periods of fee congestion. The downside is that it would require a soft fork. However, it could potentially help participants use fee-bumping techniques to close or restructure their channels during elevated fee markets. The workshop also touched on other ideas such as a transaction relay overlay network and mining pools exposing public APIs to push transactions directly. The impact of changes to Bitcoin Core on L2 protocols was also discussed, with some changes conflicting with the goal of minimizing transaction propagation times. The next meeting will focus on fee bumping and package relay advancements in Bitcoin Core. Additionally, a proposal for full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) in a future version of Bitcoin Core was posted, but concerns were raised about mempool partitions and its impact on businesses relying on zero confirmations.</p>
