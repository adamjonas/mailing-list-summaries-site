    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread discussing a proposal for an opcode, James MacWhyte expresses his support for the idea. Russell raises concerns about potential attacks on the system, but James argues that implementing the proposal would actually make it less attractive to double spenders than the current model. He suggests rewriting the proposal to include the maxheight in the taproot annex, and explains that an auto-double-spend wallet would limit payment validity to the next block. In response to Billy's suggestion for relay rules, James clarifies that the inclusion of a transaction with 0 transaction fee in a block is not an abuse, but relaying such transactions can be seen as an abuse due to its potential to usurp Bitcoin's gossip network. He emphasizes the importance of having a cost to relay transactions to prevent abuse.</p>
