    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The current git HEAD has been proposed to Gavin and the rest of the dev team as 0.3.23-rc1, and builds are ready to upload as soon as Gavin gives his approval. The main focus of this release was to deploy a fix for connections taking forever, which was caused by a large portion of the network not accepting incoming TCP connections. This was intended to be a fast, bugfix-only release.Git shortlog for 0.3.23-rc1 (assuming Gavin's ACK) shows updates made by various contributors including Dean Lee, Doug Huff, Han Lin Yap, Jeff Garzik, Matt Corallo, Nils Schneider, and Pieter Wuille. Dean Lee updated Chinese Simp translation while Doug Huff fixed rfc1918 and rfc3927 compliance for ignoring non-internet-routable hosts, added common temp files to .gitignore, and demystified a few magic numbers. Han Lin Yap added Swedish translation and removed an unused variable. Jeff Garzik made four different contributions which included bumping version to 0.3.23, reducing minimum TX fee for new transactions to 0.0005, lowering minimum relay TX fee to 0.0001 BTC, and adding minimal release process docs. Matt Corallo fixed the CPU usage bug when using -nolisten and having no connections, Nils Schneider created keypool in LoadWallet(), and Pieter Wuille updated transactions already in the wallet when rescanning, fixed small change outputs, and provided faster timeout when connecting. Overall, the release focuses on fixing bugs and improving performance.</p>
