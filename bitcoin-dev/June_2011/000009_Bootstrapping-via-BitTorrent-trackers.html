    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff has suggested that DNS bootstrapping can be very robust. Seeds can be hosted by services like zerigo and thousands of small VPS operated by people all over the world. If namecoin lives up to its promises, some seeds can be hosted using its TLDs, thereby getting around centralised ICANN/registrar weakness. Publishing build instructions for a simple DNS server build and a script which feeds it with node data could be a practical way to improve DNS bootstrapping. Hardcoding seeds into the client may not be good enough. A convention could be used where anyone owning a bitcoin. * domain points seed.bitcoin. * to a decent DNS seed. However, there is a concern if this would enable some attacks by poisoned seeds.</p>
