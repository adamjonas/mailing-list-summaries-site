    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In June 2011, Pieter Wuille initiated a discussion to merge autotools and qtgui. However, it was noted that the autotools branch had not been tested enough on native Windows and Mac platforms. Jaromil's autotools branch, which included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch, was suggested for testing by people using different systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw cross-compile, and OSX. It was reported that this worked fine on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui. John Smith expressed his opinion that his Qt GUI was functionally complete and stable and was ready for merging. Pieter agreed to merge autotools unless there were still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility, and suggested marking the changes to the core as 'experimental', and not enabled by default. The only disadvantage of another GUI is that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code would now need to make changes in three places instead of two, but more people were willing to work on Qt code than on wx code, as stated by Pieter.</p>
