    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The issues that need to be addressed for the scaling up of the blockchain technology include disconnections that occur during block chain downloads. Wallet security and a unit testing framework are also critical needs. The unit testing framework should have a suite of test cases, and it will require a thorough code review to uncover latent issues. To address wallet security, publishing a "Best security practices" document could help educate the user base. Although new features like escrow transactions may be enticing, it is essential to prioritize solving these critical issues first. It's worth noting that multi-signature coins could help with wallet security concerns, even if end-user machines are compromised.</p>
