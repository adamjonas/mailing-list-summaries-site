    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between John Smith and Pieter, John announces that his Qt GUI is ready for merging. He asks about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs. Pieter expresses his support for merging the autotools now unless there are still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. Pieter also mentions that if the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, he would vote to have it merged as well under certain conditions. Those conditions include minimal/trivial changes to the 'core' and being marked as 'experimental' and not enabled by default. While acknowledging that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now need changes in 3 places instead of 2, Pieter notes that there are much more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</p>
