    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The block sizes have once again grown quite large, leading to a potential issue with the 10mb flood control limit. During testing, the author was disconnected due to surpassing the limit, which could be caused by an average of 20kb per block at 500 blocks. This limitation could pose a serious scalability issue for the system. To address this problem, the author suggests two possible solutions. One is to simply increase the flood control limit, while the other involves raising the limit and decreasing the batch size. Currently, messages containing 500 blocks can become unwieldy no matter how high the flood control limit is set. Lowering the batch size to 100 or even 50 could slow chain download speed in high latency environments, but chain download is already a bottleneck. Overall, the author is requesting thoughts and input on how to best address this issue with the growing block sizes and flood control limitations.</p>
