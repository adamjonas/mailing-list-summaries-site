    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In June 2011, a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability was reported in ClearCoin. The vulnerability report was brought to the attention of Gavin Andresen by Doug Huff. The CSRF vulnerabilities were particularly dangerous since Google account authentication was used by ClearCoin and it was hosted on appspot. This meant that users staying logged into their Google accounts could be vulnerable to the CSRF attacks. The vulnerability was taken seriously and promptly fixed.</p>
