        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In June 2011, ClearCoin was reported to have a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability, which was brought to the attention of Gavin Andresen by Doug Huff. The CSRF vulnerabilities were particularly dangerous as Google account authentication was used by ClearCoin and it was hosted on appspot, which meant that users staying logged into their Google accounts could be vulnerable to the CSRF attacks. The vulnerability was taken seriously and promptly fixed.However, the author of the report has decided to publicly disclose multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in <a href="http://clearcoin.appspot.com">http://clearcoin.appspot.com</a> instead of privately reporting them. The CSRFs are hosted on appspot and use Google account authentication, making anyone logged into their Google account vulnerable. The author even tested changing refund address and releasing funds providing POC code that can be opened on any browser. The site is run and maintained by Gavin Anderson, the lead bitcoin maintainer.The conversation between Gavin Andresen and Doug Huff on June 19, 2011, centered around the disclosure of vulnerabilities in ClearCoin. Gavin mentioned that he takes private disclosures of vulnerabilities seriously and confirmed that the CSRF vulnerability in ClearCoin had been fixed, thanking Doug for bringing it to his attention. However, Doug then reported multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in <a href="http://clearcoin.appspot.com">http://clearcoin.appspot.com</a> which were particularly nasty as the site was hosted on appspot and used Google account authentication, leaving users vulnerable as long as they remained logged into their Google accounts. It is worth noting that Gavin's website, clearcoin.com, was also linked in his signature.</p>
