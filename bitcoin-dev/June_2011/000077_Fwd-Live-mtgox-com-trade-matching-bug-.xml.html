    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2011, a discussion arose on whether Mt Gox related topics should be discussed in the Bitcoin development forum. While some argued that it was just as relevant as other Bitcoin software, others pointed out that because it was closed source, there was nothing that could be done about it by forum members. Additionally, there was concern about disclosing security vulnerabilities publicly and the need to give developers enough time to fix them before going public. The email ended with a digital signature attachment for added security.</p>
