    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on June 17, 2011, John Smith announced that his Qt GUI was ready for merging. He had been using it for some time and found that all functionalities were working well. However, he wanted to know what the current roadmap was for including the autotools build system so that it would be possible to support multiple GUIs.The consensus among the group was to merge autotools and qtgui. However, there was a concern that autotools had not been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. Therefore, Pieter asked if anyone on the list had experience with either development environment and would be willing to test it out.</p>
