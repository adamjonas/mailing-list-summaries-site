    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message sent on June 17th, 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his support for dropping the wxWidgets GUI from the Bitcoin reference client and replacing it with a Qt GUI. He argued that supporting more than one GUI was not a good idea. However, he wanted to ensure that the license for Qt was not an issue since it is LGPL. Andresen also asked John if he was willing to release his code under the Bitcoin MIT license. He then posed a question to everyone else to see if anyone objected to replacing wxWidgets with Qt. Finally, he mentioned that they needed to come up with a new name for the client if they went with Qt.</p>
