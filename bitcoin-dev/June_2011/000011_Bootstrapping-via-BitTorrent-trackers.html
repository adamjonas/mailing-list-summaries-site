    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In June 2011, Gavin suggested a practical way to improve DNS bootstrapping by publishing build instructions for a simple DNS server and a script that feeds it with node data. He proposed using something like djbdns plus a Perl script or similar zerigo API script. The idea was to hardcode a bunch of such DNS seeds into the client. Jeff Garzik agreed that adding this code to Bitcoin in a contrib/dns folder would be a good idea. He planned to put together a couple of different solutions within three to four weeks. Jeff had a thought related to this. He suggested creating an RPC in Bitcoin that returns a random selection of fresh P2P node addresses from addr.dat. He ran into trouble accessing this data from outside Bitcoin and thought that ArtForz's half-a-node could be used as a base. However, he believed creating a "getnodes" RPC would be far easier. Jeff recommended using djbdns (tinydns) as it is highly scalable and stable, and its input is a very simple text format, easier to generate than BIND zone files. Gavin expressed his willingness to run a DNS seed. Jeff emphasized the importance of trusted people running DNS seeds on stable connectivity once the DNS software is there.</p>
