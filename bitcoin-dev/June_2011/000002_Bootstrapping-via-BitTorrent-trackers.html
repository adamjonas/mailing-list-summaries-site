    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion, Chris suggests adopting BitTorrent tracker bootstrapping as a mechanism for bootstrapping nodes in the network. He notes that there are currently several bootstrapping mechanisms in place, including IRC bootstrapping which he deems overly complex and often suspected to be bot-activity. Chris believes that BitTorrent tracker bootstrapping would be a simpler and more efficient method as it returns a list of nodes with the same hash given a SHA1 hash (such as that of the genesis block). Chris suggests using 2-3 open trackers which accept and track any hash thrown at them for bootstrapping purposes. The downside to this approach is that they return bencoded data which needs to be interpreted first, but Chris still thinks it's easier than implementing the IRC stuff. Chris ends his post by asking for any comments or feedback on his suggestion.</p>
