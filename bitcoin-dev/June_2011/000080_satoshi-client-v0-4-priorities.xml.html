    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Jun 28, 2011, Jeff Garzik emphasized the importance of wallet crypto and wallet import/export features for version 0.4 of Bitcoin. The rationale behind wallet crypto is obvious while sipa's wallet import/export, which might need a rebase, is significant for further wallet security such as printing out and storing a private key in a bank's safety deposit box. Garzik suggested that autotools and other stuff can wait if they hold up the release of wallet crypto. Doug Huff added to the conversation by mentioning that Sipa had already rebased his showwallet tree and it was in a functional state. However, it's missing the segfault fix but said fix merges cleanly. It's not entirely sure whether it's ready for pulling or not.</p>
