    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in this context is about the advantages and disadvantages of using trackers, compared to IRC servers and DNS Seeds, for bootstrapping Bitcoin clients. Using HTTP requests to a tracker has several benefits such as better load balancing, no virus/botnet like behavior, and faster adaptation than DNS Seeds. Vladimir Marchenko proposed a bootstrap method in which bitcoind would listen on a specific last octet of an IPv4 address, such as .14, allowing clients to scan addresses until they find a bitcoind peer. However, this method was deemed impractical and messy by other members of the discussion. Jeff Garzik raised concerns about how clients would discover HTTP trackers, and whether or not hardcoding them into the client would create the same problems as current methods.</p>
