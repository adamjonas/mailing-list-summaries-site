    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email argues that decentralization is not responsible for the success of a project, and having several choices of software implementation offers no advantage to the project unless there is an attack on fungibility or consensus. The author suggests using Bitcoin Core version 21 and creating a fork to start developing if there is such an attack. The email emphasizes that creating a properly delegated organization is necessary for the maintenance of Bitcoin's consensus and decentralized currency, but decentralizing one's own work only requires several offices available for delegation. The author also mentions that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will allow buying and selling Bitcoin as one of its services, and emphasizes the importance of defending the existing consensus as the right of trade in every UTXO has value because of that consensus. In addition, the email quotes a blog post that talks about strange expectations and the need for more people to use alternative full node implementations, contribute to alternative Bitcoin projects, and get involved in important roles from different countries. The email concludes with a call to fight for consensus and revoke positions for the good of Bitcoin and its continued success.</p>
