        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev forum, n1ms0s made a proposal to ensure that lite wallets connect only to nodes with at least protocol version 70016. However, this protocol version was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.21.0, which does not contain taproot activation parameters and thus will not relay taproot spends. As a result, the proposed solution is not perfect and will only work if connected to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 and 22.0 versions or compatible nodes programmed to begin relaying taproot spends starting one block before activation.Dave queried whether there was a better heuristic for lite wallets to connect to a taproot-activated node and suggested that this could be something that nodes advertise during activation of future protocol extensions. Furthermore, Dave provided links to relevant sources for further reading.</p>
