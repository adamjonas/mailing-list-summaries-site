    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The activation of Taproot, a significant upgrade to Bitcoin's protocol, has recently taken place. A number of key events related to the activation have been recorded for posterity. Prior to the activation, 0xB10C and F2Pool spent from Taproot (P2TR) outputs in July, months before Taproot rules were enforced. These spends did not need to meet Taproot consensus rules and are therefore not considered the "first" Taproot spends. The last block before Taproot rules were enforced was Block 709631, mined by AntPool. Non-timelocked P2TR outputs were considered anyone-can-spend as Taproot rules were not yet being enforced. The first block where full nodes started enforcing Taproot rules was Block 709632, mined by F2Pool. However, F2Pool did not enforce Taproot rules and did not include any Taproot spends in this block. An invalid Taproot spend included in this block could have caused a re-org when full nodes rejected the block. Similarly, AntPool did not include any Taproot spends in Blocks 709633 and 709634. The first block with valid Taproot spends was Block 709635, mined by Foundry USA.Several individuals completed Taproot spends after activation, including bitbug42, Andrew Chow, Pieter Wuille, BitGo, jaoNoctus, narcelio, and ottosch. Alekos Filini used modified code from the BDK library to complete the first use of OP_CHECKSIGADD on mainnet. Many individuals and entities were instrumental in monitoring and highlighting these various events online, including 0xB10C, Greg Maxwell, Murch, Daniel McNally, Rearden Code, Chun, and pinheadmz. Various block explorers were also useful for monitoring Taproot activation. Overall, there was significant interest and scrutiny of this successful upgrade, demonstrating a promising future for Bitcoin.</p>
