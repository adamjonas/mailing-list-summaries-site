    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion involves the need for more people from different countries to take up important roles in Bitcoin. However, there are concerns about funding individuals from under-represented countries due to threats of attacks on their funding. Additionally, anonymous individuals being funded by non-robust sources may not offer much protection since the weakest link will usually be the legal freedom of an individual. Despite this, it is argued that smart humans will arise everywhere and it is in the interest of Bitcoin users to have more people contribute to its success. The alternative is that smart people who start out in a disadvantaged environment may attack Bitcoin to escape their situation.</p>
