    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Prayank and Yanmaani centers on the issue of decentralization in Bitcoin full node implementations. Prayank suggests that having more people use alternative full node implementations could improve decentralization, but Yanmaani notes that this is not really possible because it could lead to consensus splits. They discuss other ways to improve decentralization, including having more independent contributors like Luke Dashjr and Amir Taaki, more people from different countries involved in important roles, and funding alternative full node implementations like Bitcoin Knots. However, Yanmaani argues that these solutions are limited by the issue of money, with contributors being less likely to be independent if their source of income is not independent. Yanmaani suggests that a system like Monero's CCS or a fund controlled in a civilized and non-centralized way could help insulate developers from threats to their funding and improve decentralization. Ultimately, they agree that funding is a difficult problem to solve in Bitcoin due to its public good nature.</p>
