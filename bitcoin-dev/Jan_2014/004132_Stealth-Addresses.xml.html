    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the name for a new Bitcoin feature, Jeremy Spilman suggested the name "reusable address." However, Peter Todd strongly disagreed, arguing that "stealth addresses" would be a better name for the feature. Todd explained that the term "reusable addresses" could be confusing to users as it is not clear what makes them different from regular bitcoin addresses. On the other hand, "stealth addresses" implies privacy, which is an important selling point for the new feature. Additionally, Todd noted that "stealth addresses" had already gained significant publicity, and changing the name now could slow down adoption. He pointed out that at a recent Bitcoin meetup in Toronto, almost everyone present had heard of stealth addresses and understood their benefits.</p>
