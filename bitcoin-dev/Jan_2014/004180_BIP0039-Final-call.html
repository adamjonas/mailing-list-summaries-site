    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about BIP39, Christophe Biocca suggested including the wordlist as part of the standard to ensure fully compliant implementations could correct user's typos. In response, slush stated that they split the proposal into two parts - one essential for bip39 compatibility, and the other optional, including their proposed wordlist with advanced features like checksums. They left it up to client developers to decide whether to insist on their own wordlist or follow the full specification with checksums. Peter Todd raised an issue with the proposal making the current BIP39 draft a standard, suggesting it could lead to users losing a lot of money. Brooks Boyd questioned if the mnemonic sentence would be converted to a brainwallet since every mnemonic sentence could now lead to a bip32 node, and only the client that created the mnemonic could verify the mnemonic passes its checksum. However, slush responded that Trezor and bitcoinj (Multibit) were going in this way, which is 100% of clients interested in bip39.</p>
