    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin-development mailing list was discussing the importance of the Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) feature in the 0.9 version of the blockchain.info wallet. Mark Friedenbach stressed its importance, as people have lost money without it. He explained that if a low-priority donation from a blockchain.info wallet doesn't make it into a block within 24 hours, the transaction is forgotten and the inputs are resold on the next transaction the user makes. Jeff Garzik from BitPay also expressed his support for CPFP, but noted that disagreements on edge case handling and implementation details were preventing its merge. The message also mentioned that incoming transactions without fees are rebroadcasted to keep them in mempools at several nodes including bc.info. Lastly, the email included an advertisement for CenturyLink Cloud and a PGP signature.</p>
