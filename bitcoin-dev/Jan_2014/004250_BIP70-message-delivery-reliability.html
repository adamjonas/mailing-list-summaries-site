    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Chuck and an unnamed individual are discussing the implementation of Bitcoin Core and bitcoinj protocols. They note that any changes made from this point on must be backwards compatible. Chuck suggests that a receipt including PaymentRequest and transactions would suffice for proving payment, to which the other person agrees. They also discuss the purpose of the receipt in providing arbitrary data with the purchase as well as refunding addresses and hooks for future features such as ECDH key agreements. They emphasize the importance of the customer signing the message with the private key of the refund address in Step 3. However, it is noted that refund addresses are currently optional and will not be used until HD wallets support is done. The conversation concludes with a plan to evolve PaymentRequest/Payment/PaymentACK with backwards compatible upgrades.</p>
