    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Odinn has posted a concept of a background microdonation on the stealth discussion and asked for thoughts. The full concept is available on the source link provided. Jeremy Spilman believes that replacing static address text with new 'href=bitcoin:xSTL...' URIs would encourage people to use them for P2P payments which do not involve a full-stack merchant. The idea is to integrate stealth addresses into OpenPGP keys as a new user id type or similarly into x.509 certs. The identity of *who* you are paying is important, not just "I got this signed payment request". Peter suggests sticking with defining a reasonable stealth address spec, keeping in mind that it may need upgrading in the future. Peter states that putting stealth address into PaymentDetails is not the right approach. It should go into the Output message. Once Addresses are established that Outputs specify, then it's easy enough to make a stealth address type, or a BIP32-chain-code address type, or whatever else comes up in the future. There should be multiple different stealth payments within a single wallet to the same merchant/pubkeys to be identifiable as such.</p>
