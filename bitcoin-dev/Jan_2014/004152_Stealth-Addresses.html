    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread from January 17, 2014, the Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses possible alternatives to the term "address" when referring to Bitcoin addresses. Peter Todd argues against the name "reusable address" and suggests sticking with the name "stealth address," as it has already gained momentum in the public consciousness and changing the name now risks people not making the connection when wallet software is upgraded to support them. Others suggest alternative names, such as "privacy key" or "payment key." Mike Hearn proposes the name "privacy address" instead of "stealth address," as he believes it packs more of a marketing punch and is less likely to have bad associations. The discussion continues with various opinions on what would be the best term to use. Cam suggests that "personal account" or "personal address" could imply that the balance on such an account should not be assumed to be public knowledge. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding a term for Bitcoin addresses that is both accurate and conveys the desired message.</p>
