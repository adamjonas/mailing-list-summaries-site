    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the use of stealth addresses in Bitcoin transactions. It is suggested that instead of using long addresses, the payment protocol could be extended with new fields to include a second pubkey for communication purposes, which would have backward compatibility. The email then outlines two approaches to ECDH, and suggests a way to detect transactions with keys that cannot spend funds. The email also proposes adding prefixes to user-friendly strings for single pubkey (41 byte) stealth addresses, and lists potential issues with deriving a second public key from the first. Finally, the email outlines plans to implement prototypes for pay-to-Stealth addresses, watcher processes, and offline verification. The email includes links to academic papers on reusing ephemeral keys in Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocols and validation of elliptic curve public keys.</p>
