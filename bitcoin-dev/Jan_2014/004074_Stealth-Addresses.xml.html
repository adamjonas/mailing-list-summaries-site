    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Roy Badami discussed the under-addressed use case of non-transactional personal payments. He expressed his desire to be able to easily open his wallet, select a friend from his address book, and transfer owed funds to them. Badami stated that not much work is being done on this issue and suggested that stealth addresses could be a solution for it. However, Peter Todd questioned the feasibility of such a solution due to the significant number of EC multiply operations required. Badami also mentioned ongoing developments in consumer-to-merchant transactions, including BIP 70 and Andreas Schildbach's work with Bluetooth and NFC technology.</p>
