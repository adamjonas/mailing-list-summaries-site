    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author suggests that better options should be provided to users for perfect privacy without high computational overhead. They propose the idea of shifting bandwidth requirements by setting up a UTXO only full node at home, which can be connected to via a hidden service hosted on Tor. The smartphone acts as a web client for the wallet running at home and learns two codes during the initial connection: a hidden service name and an access token that is revocable. With fast bootstrapping of the UTXO, usability could be as good as SPV, and push notifications for relevant transactions would have zero privacy trade-off. The author wonders if people would want to run such an app on their desktop, a dedicated machine, or an old smartphone or cheap ARM device.</p>
