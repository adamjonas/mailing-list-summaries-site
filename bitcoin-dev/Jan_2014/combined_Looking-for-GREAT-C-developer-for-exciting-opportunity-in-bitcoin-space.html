        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In December 2013, Evan Duffield, the founder of Hawk Financial Group, LLC, posted an email on a bitcoin-development list seeking experienced C++ programmers familiar with Bitcoin internals to work on a merge-mined altcoin project. The project aimed to provide a useful service to the entire crypto-coin ecosystem. Applicants with experience in adding features to Bitcoin or related technologies were preferred. Interested candidates were required to sign a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement before receiving detailed plans and roles for the project.However, some concerns were raised about such emails hijacking the list and causing discussions between core-devs to move elsewhere. Jeremie, a long-time follower of bitcoin-development, expressed concerns, while Peter Todd cautioned against merge mining due to the possibility of an attacker using existing hashing power to execute a 51% attack at negligible cost. He suggested starting a timestamping service as a possible exception. Troy Benjegerdes made a unique offer to the startup by buying their company from the revenue generated by his AGPLv3 licensed cryptographic currency. He warned them to seek legal counsel to prevent contamination of their business model with a viral copyright license.In an email exchange, Luke disagreed with Todd's point, stating that any non-scam altcoin is safe using merged mining since it would be in the attacker's interest to invest in the altcoin rather than attacking it. Luke Dashjr, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, has suggested that merged mining can be used to enhance the security of cryptocurrencies. Merged mining is a process which allows miners to mine more than one blockchain at the same time, using the same hash power.Dashjr believes that by leveraging merged mining, altcoins can benefit from the full security of the Bitcoin network. This is particularly useful for smaller altcoins that may not have sufficient hash power to secure their own networks. According to him, it is possible to obtain the full security of the Bitcoin network even when not all miners participate in the altcoin.Overall, merged mining could be a useful tool for enhancing the security of cryptocurrencies. It allows altcoins to leverage the hash power of larger networks like Bitcoin, which can help make them more resilient to attacks. Dashjr's suggestions for maximizing the benefits of merged mining could further improve its effectiveness.</p>
