    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The user is looking to run a program on lightweight or embedded hardware that has access to the Bitcoin network. However, they do not have enough resources to set up a trusted node along with their program. They are in need of a way to ask an untrusted Bitcoin node to compute some 'metric request' on their behalf and have the result validated by the network. The user is asking if there are any available or work-in-progress projects that would fulfill this need or if they should build it themselves. Another person suggests setting up a node, creating an API interface, and having the app use the API on the node.</p>
