    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Jorge Tim√≥n and Peter Todd, they discussed the idea of merge-mined Zerocoin implementation with a 1:1 BTC/ZTC exchange rate enforced by the software. However, some miners might not agree that enabling better privacy is a good thing or their local governments won't. They can attack the Zerocoin merge-mined chain with a marginal cost of nearly zero. Peter Todd argued that merged mining is not only about not competing for proof of work but also about wasting resources. By criticizing merged mining, one is indirectly legitimizing the same scamcoin madness being criticized. Peter Todd also said he thinks Namecoin has a lower reward for miners than Litecoin and still has much better security.</p>
