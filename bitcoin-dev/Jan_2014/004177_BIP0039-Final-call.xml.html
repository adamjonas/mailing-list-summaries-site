    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 20, 2014, slush informed the community that they have reconsidered all comments on their BIP39 proposal and tried to meet all requirements for such standard. The revised proposal does not require any specific wordlist, so every client can use its own list of preferred words. Generated mnemonic can be applied to any other BIP39-compatible client. However, Brooks Boyd had an issue with the proposed standard. He believed that due to the hashing technique, the "mnemonic sentence" could turn into a brain wallet which could lead to users losing money. Peter Todd also expressed his concern about wallets implementing BIP39 in this way.</p>
