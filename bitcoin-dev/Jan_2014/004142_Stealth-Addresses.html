    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the naming of a Bitcoin feature that provides users with privacy when conducting transactions. While one member suggests calling it a "reusable address," another argues for using "stealth address," as it has already gained publicity and is more appealing to users. The latter member believes that the name "reusable address" is confusing and may not generate interest in the feature. Additionally, he contends that the term "stealth" is more likely to attract users who value privacy and help drive adoption. He also points out that the term "stealth" is less likely to have negative connotations than "reusable."</p>
