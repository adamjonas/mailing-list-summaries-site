    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the importance of "Child Pays for Parent" (CPFP) in Bitcoin transactions. CPFP is an essential feature that allows users to increase transaction fees on unconfirmed transactions, ensuring they are included in the blockchain and reducing the risk of lost funds. Without this option, people have lost money because the feature is missing. Low-priority donations from a blockchain.info wallet can disappear if they do not make it into a block within 24 hours, and the transaction is forgotten. The lack of CPFP means there is no way to pay higher fees to receive a donation, potentially resulting in further losses. BitPay has expressed a desire to see CPFP included in upstream, but the main hurdle to merging is that various people disagree on edge case handling and implementation details. There are no fundamental objections to its inclusion.</p>
