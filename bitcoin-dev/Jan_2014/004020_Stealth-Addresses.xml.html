    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new type of Bitcoin address and related scriptPubKey/transaction generation scheme called Stealth Address enables payees to publish a single, fixed address that payors can send funds efficiently, privately, reliably and non-interactively. The generated scriptPubKey must be globally unique and only spendable by the payee. The method must be fully deterministic and funds recoverable from a wallet seed and blockchain data for both payee and payor. It must be compatible with CoinJoin and not leak information to payee about what txins were used to pay them. Furthermore, anonymity set size can be traded off for decreased bandwidth/CPU usage if the payee specifies that payments to them are to match some short prefix k. An alternative with better efficiency could be to use bare OP_CHECK(MULTI)SIG outputs to hold the nonce pubkey. To support multisig, the ability to specify n-of-m master pubkeys using the nonce to generate derived ones is needed. The addresses will be a little longer than standard Bitcoin addresses.</p>
