    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on January 18, 2014, Wladimir, a member of the Dogecoin-development list, responded to Odinn Cyberguerrilla's concerns about issues with the blockchain and microdonations not being facilitated enough. Wladimir asked Odinn to point to any pull requests that could improve these problems. He also suggested that if Odinn's organization did not contribute anything to address these issues, it should not be surprising that they did not make it into the blockchain. In a light-hearted response, Odinn joked that such a failure would be very bad and much news. Wladimir expressed amusement at the humor and wondered how he ended up on the Dogecoin-development list.</p>
