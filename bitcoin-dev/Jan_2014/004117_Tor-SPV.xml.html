    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from January 15th, 2014, Brooks Boyd discussed the use of hidden services as a means of authentication and encryption. The goal was not to hide P2P nodes, but rather to utilize hidden services for their encryption capabilities. Boyd mentioned that six-hop hidden service circuits were overkill for this application, and that three-hop circuits would work just as well for most nodes that weren't Tor-exclusive. There was a discussion about reducing the number of hops below three on both sides (client/server), which would require a change to CircuitPathChooser for Orchid. For other Tor implementations, it might require using the control port to custom-build a circuit.</p>
