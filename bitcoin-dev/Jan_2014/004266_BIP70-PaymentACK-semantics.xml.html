    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the issues faced by merchants using the refund or memo feature in Bitcoin Core. As of now, merchants need to provide an alternate route for delivering this information before the transaction is made. This renders these fields useless and removes the ability to rely on the payment protocol being bidirectional. Pieter proposes that a client should make a reasonable attempt of delivering the payment if delivery fails, and if the paymentACK has been received, the client is no longer responsible for broadcasting the transaction. To deliver refund/memo fields reliably, different options are suggested, such as sending them as part of the initial request or as a response to PaymentRequest/PaymentDetails before the transaction is even formed. However, all of these require too many changes to the protocol. In "Step 3," it is critical that the customer signs the message with the private key of the refund address so that the merchant can be confident about the refund address's correctness.</p>
