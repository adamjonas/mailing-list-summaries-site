    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Clément Elbaz is designing a program that needs metrics computed from the Bitcoin blockchain, specifically some address balances or the occurrence of a specific transaction. He does not trust <a href="http://blockchain.info/">http://blockchain.info/</a> and wants his program to run on lightweight/embedded hardware with access to the Bitcoin network but not enough resources to set up a trusted node along with his program. His program trusts the global Bitcoin network but no individual node. Clément is looking for a way to ask an untrusted Bitcoin node to compute some 'metric request' on his behalf and have the result of that metric request validated by the network. He is asking if there are any available or work-in-progress projects that would come close to this need or if he should do it himself.</p>
