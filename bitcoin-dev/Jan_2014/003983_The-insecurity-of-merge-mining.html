    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin-wizards mailing list, a member posited that an altcoin tied directly to Bitcoin proof-of-work would be immune to a 51% attack. However, another member disagreed, stating that tying the alt-coin difficulty to the Bitcoin difficulty would not avoid a 51% attack because attackers could mine a conflicting chain and there is no reasonable way to choose between the two chains other than proof-of-something. The only way to solve double-spending with proof-of-publication is through some sort of mathematically verifiable majority aligned with the interests of the crypto-coin users. A solution was proposed last summer but could only make it clear that an attack was happening and how many bitcoins needed to be sacrificed to make the chain secure.</p>
