        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, Clément Elbaz proposed the idea of creating a 'metric request block chain' to store structures defined as [metric request | current block number when request was made | hash of the response] instead of financial transactions. These structures are verifiable and could function similarly to a regular financial blockchain. Clément suggested that this 'metric request block chain' should not be part of the main Bitcoin protocol but could be a plugin interacting with the data managed by the fullnode bitcoin software. He also mentioned the need to pay a fee for each metrics request since they can be computationally expensive and require validation.Clément is designing a program that requires metrics computed from the Bitcoin blockchain, such as address balances or specific transaction occurrences. However, his program will run on lightweight/embedded hardware and does not have the resources to set up a trusted node alongside it. While he trusts the global Bitcoin network, he does not trust individual nodes. Therefore, Clément is seeking a way to ask an untrusted Bitcoin node to compute a 'metric request' on his behalf and have the result validated by the network. He is inquiring about any existing or in-progress projects that could fulfill this need, or if he should undertake building it himself.</p>
