    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum, has written a Python-levelDB implementation of UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) hashtree. He expressed his appreciation for Mark's work on this and stated that he is closely following it since it is of primary importance for Electrum. Thomas suggested testing different options before writing a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). He also proposed that BIPs should define interoperability points but not implementation details. Furthermore, he questioned whether it would be possible to do partial prefix queries on that tree and suggested creating per-block indexes of all scriptPubKeys, spent or unspent, queryable via the same partial prefix method. Peter Todd, in response, suggested testing the implementation thoroughly on Electrum and getting a feel for its performance and usability before any soft-fork to make it a miner commitment. Finally, he recommended adding a C++ implementation to Bitcoin Core as a bloom filter replacement and making it available over the P2P network.</p>
