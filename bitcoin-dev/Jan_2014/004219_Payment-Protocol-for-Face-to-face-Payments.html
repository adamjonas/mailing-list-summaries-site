    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas Schildbach discusses the current landscape of scan-to-pay transactions, stating that at least 50% of Bitcoin transactions are initiated by a BIP21 URL encoded into a QR-code. He tried to encode a payment request into the bitcoin URL using his existing work on encoding transactions into QR-codes. Andreas then asks several questions regarding the use of scan-to-pay, including whether payers are using their own connectivity to submit the payment response after scanning the QR code with the protobuf PaymentRequest, and whether it would be better to get a URL from the QR code and re-use existing infrastructure for serving that. Additionally, he suggests putting a Bluetooth address in the payment_url inside the PaymentDetails message for the smartphone to send back the Payment response and get PaymentAck.</p>
