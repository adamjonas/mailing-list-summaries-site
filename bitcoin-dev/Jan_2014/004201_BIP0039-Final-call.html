    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 21, 2014, a discussion was held regarding the use of wordlists in Bitcoin wallets. Thomas Voegtlin thanked slush for his new proposal and mentioned that implementing a wordlist as part of the standard could lead to problems of collisions once users request wordlists in every language. Instead, he suggested implementing checksums that do not rely on the wordlist. Peter Todd proposed using the brute force method with SHA256 to generate a seed, which Trezor devices should be able to handle. The goal is to generate a seed by combining entropy from the Trezor device and user's computer while allowing the computer to verify the seed using only a master public key. The bip39 proposal was designed to achieve this, but it imposes its own dictionary. The proposal could be used as an option for Trezor in Electrum, but Thomas Voegtlin is reluctant to make it the default.</p>
