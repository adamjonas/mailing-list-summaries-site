    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation dated January 12, 2014, Gavin Andresen urged for a simplified payment protocol that could be easily understood by non-geeks. He warned of the consequences of not doing so, which would result in spending the next two years writing codes that try to ignore line breaks and spaces while changing elements in HTML forms. However, he also mentioned that those who can use the payment protocol may not need stealth addresses to prevent reuse. Andresen further provided examples of scenarios where a simplified payment protocol would be beneficial, such as putting a donation address on a static webpage or billboard. He believed that the purpose of stealth addresses was to fix privacy issues where real-time two-way communication was not feasible.</p>
