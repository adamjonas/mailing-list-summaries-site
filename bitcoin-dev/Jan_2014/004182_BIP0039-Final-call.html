    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, members of the Bitcoin community are discussing proposals for a wordlist to be used in a new standard called bip39. One member suggests that including a wordlist as part of the standard would be beneficial to ensure compliance and correct user typos. However, another member points out that implementing a standard wordlist in every language could cause problems with collisions. They suggest implementing checksums that do not depend on the wordlist as a solution. This would also allow for the implementation of sipa's variable stretching proposal. However, they acknowledge that it may not be possible due to the computational requirements of devices such as Trezor. Ultimately, the group agrees that it is impossible to reach a community-wide agreement on the wordlist and that it should be left up to client developers to decide if they want to insist on their own wordlist or implement checksums following the full specification. Two clients, Trezor and bitcoinj (Multibit), express interest in bip39 and seem to be going in this direction.</p>
