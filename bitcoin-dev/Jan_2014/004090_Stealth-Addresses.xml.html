    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from January 2014, Adam Back contacted Jeremy Spilman about a possible typo in his code. Specifically, he asked if the `Util.SingleSHA256()` function was multiplying by G internally and suggested that Q'=Q+H(S)*G was what was intended rather than Q'=Q+H(S). In response, Spilman confirmed that SingleSHA256 is a single application of SHA256 and explained that the multiplication by G is part of his `EC.PointAdd` implementation. He also shared the relevant code snippet for `PointAdd`, which takes a byte array representing a point and another byte array as scalar input, and returns the resulting point after adding the two. The method also has an optional boolean input for specifying whether to return a compressed or uncompressed byte array. Finally, Spilman joked that he should probably just publish all his code as MIT and be done with it.</p>
