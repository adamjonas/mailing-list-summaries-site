    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email on January 3, 2014, Troy Benjegerdes poses several questions related to Bitcoin's use of port 8333 and its absence from the IANA registry. He asks what needs to happen for someone from the Bitcoin Foundation to fill out the form asking for an assigned port, and what the process should be for new cryptocurrencies to get default port numbers and P2P network identifier 'magic numbers'. IANA normally registers ports with conservation in mind, and two unassigned ports (8333 and 18333) are currently available. It would be ideal to have separate ports for the main net and test net, but only one may be granted due to conservation considerations. The possibility of multiplexing traffic over a single port is also raised. The email includes a list of other assigned and unassigned ports, and it's noted that a slew of alternative coins reserving ports could raise eyebrows.</p>
