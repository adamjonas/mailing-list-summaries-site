    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on January 17, 2014 at 2:39:31 AM, Christophe Biocca emphasized the need for miners to recognize and account for the situation of "child pays for parent patch." Currently, only eligius is running it, but proposals have been made to merge it into mainline. Biocca believes that if a transaction is relayed directly to Eligius, it would likely get mined. However, creating the transaction is considered the hard part. Biocca also noted in passing that mining nodes should not be running mainline and should instead set up their own customized transaction policies.</p>
