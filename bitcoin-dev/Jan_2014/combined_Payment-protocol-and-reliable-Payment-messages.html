        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchanges revolve around Pieter Wuille's proposal for using a payment protocol for face-to-face payments. The proposal involves using NFC or QR payment requests, Bluetooth messages for payment confirmation, and the inclusion of a Bluetooth MAC address in the payment URL. Wuille suggests that if a payment URL is present, it should be encouraged to only send the payment there instead of broadcasting the transaction on the P2P network to minimize the risk of confirming a transaction without receiving payment. However, potential flaws in the payment system are also discussed, particularly with the contract hash. The concern is that the merchant may let the buyer's funds sit in limbo and force the buyer to initiate a dispute. To address this issue, it may be beneficial for the buyer to have time-stamped evidence of sending the funds to the merchant and proof that the merchant did not collect the funds, which could include omission from the blockchain.Other email threads discuss the legal binding of payment requests, the relevance of an expiry time in the message, the purpose of a payment request if it's not binding, and the need to provide an alternative to the "payment_url" field in BIP70. Pieter suggests getting rid of some fields altogether and just sending the transaction, but notes that having bi-directional communication in the protocol is one of the nicest things the payment protocol can add. However, relying solely on HTTP connections could result in more failed payments due to potential issues with proxies or Bluetooth endpoints, so fallback payment URLs are suggested. The conversation also includes fair advertising rules, including the legal binding of payment requests, preventing retraction of offers through hash functions, and evidence of unfair trading leading to censure. Finally, concerns are raised about the possibility of a transaction being confirmed without the associated payment being delivered, which could be addressed by optimizing the use of payment URLs. It is suggested that merchants only send the transaction to the payment URL instead of broadcasting it on the P2P network to minimize risks.</p>
