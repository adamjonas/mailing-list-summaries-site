    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 17, 2014 at 8:53:47 PM, Jeff Garzik expressed his desire to see CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) in upstream. However, various people disagreed on the edge case handling and implementation details. Despite these disagreements, there were no fundamental objections to merging the feature. Luke acknowledged that he too had concerns with the implementation, but believed that it was better than nothing. He also suggested that major reorganisations/reimplementations could be merged later when they are written, and that merging this one did not mean that they were stuck with it forever.</p>
