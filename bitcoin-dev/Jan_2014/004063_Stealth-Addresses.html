    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the use case of attaching a payment request to an email and sending it to the recipient so that they can pay whenever they want. The security issue of using email for such transactions is highlighted, but it is noted that currently exchanging Bitcoin addresses over email is no worse. However, on further reflection, it is pointed out that reusing a PaymentRequest like this without using stealth addresses would lead to address reuse, which is not desirable. Alternative solutions, such as BIP32-style derivation, are suggested as possible alternatives to stealth addresses.</p>
