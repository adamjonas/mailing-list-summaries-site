        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In January 2014, a user named Daniel Fraga received a small donation of 0.00121 BTC without any fees attached and was hoping that it would be included in a block after a few days. However, Blockchain.info removed the transaction as transactions without fees are usually rejected by miners. Fraga suggested that if the receiver could pay a fee when the sender didn't pay any fee, it would be nice. Ben Davenport replied with a suggestion to create a transaction that spends the output to oneself while attaching a fee to it. This process doesn't require any protocol changes, but likely has to be done manually. Software could simplify the process. Fraga also suggested that Bitcoin-qt could warn the receiver about receiving a transaction without a fee and offer the option to attach a fee for faster confirmation. In response to this, Davenport explained that no protocol changes were necessary. He also noted there are proposals to make miners recognize and account for the situation of "child pays for parent patch." Currently, only Eligius is running it, but proposals have been made to merge it into mainline. Biocca believes that if a transaction is relayed directly to Eligius, it would likely get mined. However, creating the transaction is considered the hard part, and mining nodes should not be running mainline and should instead set up their own customized transaction policies. Overall, the suggestions made by Fraga and Davenport highlight possible solutions to the issue of transactions without fees being rejected by miners. Though these solutions may require manual effort or protocol changes, they could potentially be implemented in the future.</p>
