    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around providing users with better options for privacy and reducing computational overhead. The trend is towards relatively weak devices such as laptops, phones, and tablets. A possible solution could be a one-click service for bringing up an Amazon VPS, syncing a full node, and making it accessible only to the user. Another idea discussed is allowing users to run a UTXO-only, outbound-connect only full node at home on their desktop, dedicated machine, or cheap ARM device. Using Tor for tunneling, users can host a hidden service that they can connect back to from their smartphone to see balances, manage receive addresses, send funds, etc. The smartphone acts as a web client for the wallet running at home, and with fast bootstrapping/checkpointing of the UTXO, usability could be as good as SPV, with zero privacy trade-off for push-notification of relevant transactions.</p>
