    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange from January 2014, the topic of discussion is the name for a new feature in Bitcoin called "stealth addresses". Some members of the group suggest alternative names, such as "privacy address" or "reusable payment key", but Peter Todd argues strongly in favor of keeping the name "stealth address". He believes that the name has already gained significant public recognition and changing it now would slow down adoption. He also points out that the name "stealth" has positive connotations related to privacy and security, while "reusable" does not adequately convey the unique benefits of the feature. Another member of the group expresses concern that the name "stealth" may have negative associations with military hardware or criminal activity, but Todd dismisses these concerns as vague and unfounded. The group discusses the possibility of conducting an informal vote on the name, using a Google docs form.</p>
