    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the implementation of Bitcoin's payment protocol (PP) and whether to fully support sending payments to a new standard address type. The use of addresses is deemed meaningless by Mike Hearn, who believes that PP allows merchants to provide human-readable text for transactions instead of addresses. Gavin Andresen agrees with Hearn and suggests making it easy for non-geeks to use stealth addresses. The basic PaymentRequest>PaymentDetails expects an "output" of one or more TxOuts with script and amount. A fallback address will be included in the output for backward compatibility, with Q and Q2 in an extension field. The email also outlines screenshots and user interaction/flow for the PP. The current implementation shows "Pay To" and "Memo" on the Send screen, but the memo is not saved or visible after sending a payment. The Transaction Display could potentially show either the stealth multisig or the pubkeys derived from the TxOut, and sample code is expected to follow.</p>
