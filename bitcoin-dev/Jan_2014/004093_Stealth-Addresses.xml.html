    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list has suggested that the term "stealth address" used in relation to a new feature in bitcoin should be changed to something more neutral. He argues that the term 'stealth' implies something secretive is going on, which may discourage Fortune 500 companies or worldwide charities from using it. Instead, he suggests "routing address", as it describes what the address is and can be analogized to a bank's routing number. The author also offers alternative terms such as "reusable public address", "permanent public address", "permanent address", and "static address". The author notes that many people are misinterpreting the purpose of stealth addresses for tax evasion or criminal activity.</p>
