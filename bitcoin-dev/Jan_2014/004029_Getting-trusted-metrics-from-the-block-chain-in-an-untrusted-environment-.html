    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Clément proposed the idea of creating a 'metric request block chain', which would store structures defined as [metric request | current block number when request was made | hash of the response] instead of financial transactions. These structures are verifiable and could work the same way as a regular financial blockchain. The 'metric request block chain' should not be part of the main Bitcoin protocol but could be a plugin interacting with the data managed by the fullnode bitcoin software. Additionally, Clément suggested that it would make sense to pay a fee every time a metrics request is made since they can be expensive to compute and validate.</p>
