        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Social Minds, a Tokyo-based startup, has launched a new service called Reality Keys which offers real-world data to be used for Bitcoin transactions based on quantifiable facts. The service provides two cryptographic public keys for both the occurrence and non-occurrence of events. Users are required to specify the date by which they want to confirm the status or outcome of the particular event. The service is anonymous as Reality Keys only provides the keys, and does not have any knowledge of the contract or the amounts of Bitcoin at stake. Reality Keys can be seen as an alternative to smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts enable trustworthy transactions and agreements without the need for intermediaries but rely on the data fed into them being accurate. Reality Keys aims to provide this accuracy by using real-world data that is verified by third parties. The company believes that Reality Keys will be useful in various industries such as insurance, online gambling, and financial markets where trust and accuracy are paramount. By offering real-world data, it can help avoid disputes and uncertainties that may arise due to the interpretation of data. Overall, Reality Keys aims to make Bitcoin transactions more efficient, secure, and reliable by providing quantifiable data that can be used to complete or disregard transactions. The service's use of real-world data could potentially lead to increased adoption of Bitcoin in sectors that require high levels of accuracy and trust.</p>
