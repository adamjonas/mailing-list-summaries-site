    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 3, 2014, Troy Benjegerdes shared an email conversation in which Drak claimed that the NSA could alter every Bitcoin-qt download and only encryption could help. However, Gregory Maxwell argued that the solution was to check hashes. He suggested putting the hash of the source tar.gz and binaries in the blockchain to solve the problem. The conversation also mentioned how the use of cryptography remained outside mainstream usage due to the need for trust in connections and endpoints. Without this trust, there are many attack vectors. The conversation ended with Drak expressing his concern about manual hash checks by non-tech-savvy users.</p>
