    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread revolves around the challenges that may arise when blockchain growth reaches Visa-level popularity of Bitcoin. It is suggested that if the Bitcoin blockchain transforms into a cheque clearinghouse style transaction system, it could resolve many issues related to blockchain growth. Atomic protocols are recommended to deal with server failure and fraudster-related problems.Another proposal in the email thread talks about creating a protocol for recurring payments in bitcoins through subscriptions. The aim is to allow customers to pay for subscription-based services using Bitcoin, which offers new advantages such as user control over subscriptions and subscription management tools in wallets. The email outlines the detailed flow of operations for creating a subscription, ongoing payments, subscription change, and cancellation.The email thread further discusses how the process of cancelling a subscription involves the wallet and merchant. When the customer cancels the subscription, the wallet receives a notification not to accept any new payments associated with that subscription. The wallet then informs the merchant of the cancellation, and the merchant confirms the subscription's cancellation. This information was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.Apart from the cryptocurrency-related discussions, the email also includes an advertisement for WatchGuard Dimension, which provides real-time security intelligence.</p>
