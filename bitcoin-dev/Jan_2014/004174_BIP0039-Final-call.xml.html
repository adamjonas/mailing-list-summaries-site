    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on January 20, 2014, Luke-Jr questioned the compatibility of different word lists used in the process of transforming a seed into mnemonic. However, it was clarified that the wordlist is only necessary for the step of seed to mnemonic and not for the step of mnemonic to bip32 root. The hashing involved in the latter step does not require a wordlist. As a result, unless all clients use the same process of converting mnemonic to bip32 root, different clients can generate any mnemonic they wish. Luke-Jr also questioned whether this conversion should be implemented client-side rather than in Trezor firmware. It was explained that Trezor generates the seed and then converts it to mnemonic, which is displayed on the internal screen. In fact, generating the mnemonic outside of the computer is one of the main functions of Trezor.</p>
