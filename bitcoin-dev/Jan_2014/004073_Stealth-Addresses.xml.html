    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of sending "please pay me" messages is seen as a great way to conduct business transactions. However, Peter Todd believes that the most important under-addressed use case is non-transactional personal payments. While there has been much work done on consumer-to-merchant transactions, relatively little attention has been given to being able to pay friends and others face-to-face. The author desires to be able to open their wallet, select a friend from their address book and transfer owed funds with ease. This may require two-way communication but once set up, the payee should just be selected from the address book without any complicated processes. The only current solution to this use case is storing a long-lived Bitcoin address in the address book. The author suggests that stealth addresses could potentially be the best solution for addressing this issue, although more work needs to be done in this area.</p>
