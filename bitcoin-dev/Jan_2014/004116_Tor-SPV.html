    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread from January 2014, Mike Hearn proposed three ways in which Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets could identify nodes for measuring pending transactions. The first method involved querying a set of seed nodes that were hardcoded into the wallet software. The second method was based on DNS lookups to discover new IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes and then connect to them. The third method involved identifying nodes on the clearnet via their addr announcements+service flag and selecting some of these nodes using the standard clearnet anti-sybil heuristics.During the discussion, it was suggested that SPV nodes could connect to the IP using Tor, which would preserve the privacy of the SPV node and make it hard to see that it was running Bitcoin. This method would also reduce the ability of an attacker to MITM because the routing varies with each exit node.</p>
