    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the security of merge-mining versus traditional mining, Peter Todd expresses his belief that merge-mining is insecure and suggests exploring new ideas for altchains that could be more secure than MM. He also notes that people often misunderstand claims that "merged mining is insecure" to mean that merged mined altcoins are less secure than non-MM altcoins, which is false. Additionally, he points out that regular mining is not much better than merge-mining in terms of security, and raises concerns about rationality and equal opportunities among miners. Jorge Timon responds by agreeing that understanding the system will help understand thinking behind merge-mining, but disagrees about the security of MM PoW versus PoW. They also ask if there is any case where an independently pow validated altcoin is more secure than a merged mined one. Finally, Peter Todd says he needs to understand it better and think about it in more depth before forming a firm opinion on the new proposal.</p>
