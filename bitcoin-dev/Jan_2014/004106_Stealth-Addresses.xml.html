    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposed feature called "reusable address" may soon combat the issue of address reuse in cryptocurrency transactions. The feature allows for communication between parties through a single message from the payee and multiple payments to the same address are not publicly linkable on the blockchain. The payee has explicitly designated they expect to receive more than one payment at that address and payer can publicly prove they made a payment to the reusable address by revealing a secret. Some suggest calling it a "static address" instead of a "stealth address" to avoid political connotations and improve awareness that normal addresses are intended to be more one-use-ness. There is hope this feature will drive adoption and make the war against address reuse a distant memory.</p>
