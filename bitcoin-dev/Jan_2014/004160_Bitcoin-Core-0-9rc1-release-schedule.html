    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is not related to a summary. The author clarifies that he is not a doge dev and intended his message as a joke to make the reader laugh. They discuss issues related to pull requests and microdonations not being facilitated as much as they could be, and the author suggests that developers will take care of them. The author mentions their collaboration on a bitcoin project that may implement aspects of the ABIS concept in its early stages. Finally, the author hopes that their message made the reader laugh and wonders how they ended up on the dogecoin-development list.</p>
