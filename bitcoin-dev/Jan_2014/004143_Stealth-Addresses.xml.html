    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 17th January, 2014, Mike Hearn wrote about a shed that he found very fine looking. He suggested that it could be used to store their bikes. They discussed the color they should paint it and then Peter suggested "privacy address". However, someone pointed out that it was too close to private key. The discussion continued with people expressing their opinions for and against the idea of painting it stealth. Some people thought it had strong connotations with American military hardware and perhaps thieves sneaking around in the night. Eventually, the conversation ended there.</p>
