    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The need for cryptography to be integrated with mainstream use has been highlighted several times by renowned figures. The issue is that it needs to be trustworthy and automatic, otherwise, there are many attack vectors. The idea of manually checking the hash of a download is not practical for most users. A suggestion was made to add a secure downloader to the Bitcoin client, where the download link points to a metadata file with information on the download. It would suffer from the root CA problem, but at least it would provide forward security. It could also be used to download files for different projects, with explicit warnings that a new trusted key is being added. When downloading, a window would appear with confirmation options. However, each trusted key would only be linked to a specific project, and it would indicate if the project or leader is unknown.</p>
