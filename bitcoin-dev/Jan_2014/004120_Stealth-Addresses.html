    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Several individuals were discussing the naming of a new Bitcoin feature that allows for the reuse of addresses. Jeremy Spilman suggested the name "reusable address," which he believed would be easily understood by non-programmers and would encourage wallets to present options as 'one time use' vs 'reusable.' Jeff Garzik proposed "static address," while Gregory Maxwell thought it was the best choice as it improves awareness that normal addresses are intended to have more of a one-use-ness. One variation of this, "recycled address," might avert misconceptions that the "re-use" is exclusive to one's own identity.</p>
