    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A startup is looking for 1 or 2 C++ programmers experienced with bitcoin internals to work on a unique coin that will provide a useful service to the crypto-coin ecosystem. The startup requires applicants to sign a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement before receiving more information about the project. They are also interested in applicants who have added features to Bitcoin or related technologies. Detailed plans and roles are available. Interested parties can email eduffield82 at gmail.com with a description of their work experience. However, Troy Benjegerdes makes a unique offer to the startup by buying their company from the revenue generated by his AGPLv3 copyrighted licensed Minco.me(c) cryptographic currency. He claims that this currency will revolutionize work by ensuring anyone with a Mincome(C) address does not need to work. Benjegerdes warns that any concept he has publicly discussed or confidentially shared is copyrighted in 2013 and 2014 and advises the startup to seek legal counsel to prevent contamination of their business model with a viral copyright license.</p>
