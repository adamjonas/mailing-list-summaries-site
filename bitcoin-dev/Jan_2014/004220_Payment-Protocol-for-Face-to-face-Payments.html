    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 27th, 2014, Jeremy Spilman wrote an email discussing the topic of scan-to-pay and how it differs from the current Bitcoin transaction landscape. He assumed that at least 50% of Bitcoin transactions are initiated by a BIP21 URL encoded into a QR code. Despite this assumption, he attempted to encode a payment request into the Bitcoin URL. Spilman used his existing work on encoding transactions into QR codes to create steps to encode the payment request. In response to Spilman's work, the recipient of the email found it interesting and asked about the connectivity of scanning the QR code with the protobuf PaymentRequest and submitting a payment response.Spilman mentioned that he had prototyped putting a Bluetooth MAC address into the payment_url as a mechanism for the smartphone to send back the payment response and get a PaymentAck. He suggested referring to the TAP TO PAY paragraph for more information as it was mostly the same mechanism.</p>
