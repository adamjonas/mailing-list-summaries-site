    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of implementing recurring payments and subscriptions using Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer, outlines the situation and proposes a new BIP to address this feature request. Centralized services like Coinbase or Blockchain.info would have an easier time implementing it, but decentralized wallet clients may face challenges. One solution is storing a local subscription request and sending recurring payments when the wallet app is running. However, if the app is not running, the user may miss payments that they intended to make. Each solution can be cancelled at any time by the user, and a courtesy message sent to the merchant is recommended. It is also suggested that a textual reminder to send money may be preferred over actual recurring payment automation to insert additional human thought and review into the process. The email ends with a plea to keep fundraising off the mailing list and a note about bounties not working.</p>
