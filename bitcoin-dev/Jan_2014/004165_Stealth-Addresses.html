    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Alan Reiner asked about using a faster asymmetric scheme instead of the current ECDH with their curve. However, the current encryption method is only within a factor of two of the fastest available at this security level. Using another cryptosystem would require additional code and increase data usage, making it less preferable. However, in cases where payment is only being sent to Q1 and Q2 is for discovery only, they suggest using a 160-bit curve for d2/Q2 and e/P for faster multiplication and smaller OP_RETURN size. This would result in 80-bits of security which still exceeds the actual level of privacy provided by the overall solution. But if it weakens privacy significantly, then it's not worth it even if there's added complexity.</p>
