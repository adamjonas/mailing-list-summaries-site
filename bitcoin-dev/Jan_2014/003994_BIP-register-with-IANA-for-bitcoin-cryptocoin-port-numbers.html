    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The following questions have been raised about Bitcoin's port number and its visibility on IANA's website. Firstly, it has been noted that Bitcoin usually runs on port 8333, but the reason for this is unknown. Secondly, Bitcoin does not appear on IANA's list of assigned port numbers, leading to confusion about its legitimacy. Thirdly, there are queries about how someone from the Bitcoin foundation can request an assigned port through IANA's form. Lastly, the process for new cryptocurrencies to obtain default port numbers and P2P network identifier 'magic numbers' is also being questioned. These issues need to be addressed in order to clarify Bitcoin's status and to provide guidance for future cryptocurrencies.</p>
