    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email message discusses the possibility of extending the payment protocol with new fields and the development of microdonation, microtransaction, and multisignature via browser. The proposed method of extending the payment protocol involves presenting very long addresses or multiple addresses by default from within the bitcoin client, which would enable microdonations as a default. This means that the user would have the ability to support different individuals, organizations, causes, etc., for each transaction while stipulating the addresses to which this giving or microdonation would occur. Microdonations could be conducted over mobile with zero fees, and the fees were applied only to the item purchased unless the value of the microdonations was at a certain threshold value where fees would apply.The email also proposes using the microdonation process to limit the possibility of a 50%+1 attack. However, the message raises some questions regarding decentralizing the giving process, the identification of donations, and the simplest possible form of a prototype implementation.In addition to discussing microdonations and other developments, the email also suggests using 2-of-2 multisig to prevent a transaction from being spent if one party attempts to cheat. It recommends queuing transactions through an online watch process and verifying them offline before fulfilling large orders. The email also proposes creating new user-friendly prefixes for stealth addresses, including single pubkey addresses. The author plans to implement prototypes for pay-to-STEALTH addresses, a watcher process, and an offline verifier. They also include links to academic papers on ephemeral keys in Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols and elliptic curve public key validation. Finally, the email promotes CenturyLink Cloud for enterprise cloud services.</p>
