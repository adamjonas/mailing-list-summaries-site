    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Wladimir, the creator of Bitcoin, announced plans for the upcoming 0.9rc1 release in February 2014. The release would include many improvements and new features that have been added to the master since the last major release. However, there are still some open issues that need to be resolved before the release, which can be found on the Bitcoin GitHub page. Wladimir invited users to let him know if they were working on something that needs to be included or if there were any nasty bugs that needed to be solved first. Meanwhile, a user named luke-jr submitted some code changes on the Bitcoin GitHub page, which were well-tested and stable for months.</p>
