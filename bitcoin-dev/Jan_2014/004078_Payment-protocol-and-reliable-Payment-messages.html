    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Pieter Wuille expressed his concerns about the possibility of a transaction being confirmed while the associated payment is not delivered. He stated that if this happens, it means that the payment transmission cannot be relied upon. However, he later acknowledged that there may be certain situations where broadcasting the transaction to the peer-to-peer network would be necessary even if the payment messages are lost. Specifically, in cases where merchants change their minds about accepting payments after a good offer has been made, broadcasting the transaction to the blockchain would allow for the presentation of confirmed payment requests in legal proceedings.</p>
