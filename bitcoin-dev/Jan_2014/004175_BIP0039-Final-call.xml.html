    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The message is a post from slush on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. In the post, slush talks about how they have reconsidered all comments received from the community about their BIP39 proposal and tried to meet all requirements for such standard. The proposal now doesn't require any specific wordlist, so every client can use its very own list of preferred words. Generated mnemonic can be then applied to any other BIP39-compatible client. Slush asks for the last comments to current BIP39 draft because they are quickly moving towards release of Trezor firmware and they need to finalize this part of the firmware. They also recommend using a canonical form like Normalized Form C when taking the hash of Unicode data. Finally, there is a link to CenturyLink Cloud, which is described as the leader in enterprise cloud services.</p>
