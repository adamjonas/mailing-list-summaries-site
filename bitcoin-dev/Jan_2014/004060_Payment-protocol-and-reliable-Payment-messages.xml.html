    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Andreas Schildbach and Pieter Wuille, the two discussed the issue of ensuring that a payment is delivered with a Bitcoin transaction. Wuille proposed that if a payment URL is present, it should be encouraged to only send the payment there instead of broadcasting the transaction on the P2P network, which would minimize the risk of confirming a transaction without receiving payment. Schildbach agreed with this proposal but also noted that wallets must still be able to deal with scenarios where the payment fails even if the transaction succeeds. Wuille expressed his desire to use the payment protocol for face-to-face payments as well, using NFC or QR for payment requests and Bluetooth for payment confirmations. Schildbach was aware of this and asked what issues Wuille saw. The two also discussed the potential for HTTP failures in payments over the internet.</p>
