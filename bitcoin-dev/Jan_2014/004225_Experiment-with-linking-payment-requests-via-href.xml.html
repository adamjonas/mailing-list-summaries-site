    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Andreas Schildbach and an unknown person, it was suggested that using .bitcoinpaymentrequest files with the right MIME type would be better than packing a file into a URL. Andreas agreed to implement this suggestion. However, when he tried to use this method, he found that Chrome, the AOSP browser, and Firefox all insisted on handling the link with their download manager, which required an additional click. The download manager was a separate component that was not updatable with the browser, and Firefox ignored the click altogether. Andreas had registered the correct MIME type and set the MIME type of the href just in case. He provided a link to the href on <a href="http://wallet.schildbach.de,">http://wallet.schildbach.de,</a> which links to Gavin's generator. Andreas did not try suffixes, but assumed they would behave similarly. He asked for any suggestions on what else to try.</p>
