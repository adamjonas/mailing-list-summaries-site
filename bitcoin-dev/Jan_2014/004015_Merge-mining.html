    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>David Vorick, in a post made on January 4th, 2014, highlighted the possible consequences of attacking a large altcoin like Dogecoin or Bitcoin. He explained that compromising even a currency like Dogecoin could cause questions to be raised, likely drop the value of Bitcoin, and traumatize the entire cryptocurrency system. However, he also noted that currently, there is little benefit to attacking a significant currency due to the cost and potential backlash it would cause. The launch thread for Dogecoin states that the currency uses scrypt, not SHA256 like Bitcoin. The use of scrypt is common among other scamcoins as well. However, there is no clear indication from Vorick's comment about his stance on merged mining.</p>
