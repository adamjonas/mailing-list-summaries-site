    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Chuck is discussing the Bitcoin Payment Protocol (PP) with Mike Hearn. Mike mentions that both Bitcoin Core and bitcoinj are about to ship with the protocol as-is, so any changes from this point on have to be backwards compatible. Chuck thinks it's important to talk about failure situations now, rather than trying to patch on solutions later. He believes that making minor changes now could address potential problems much more easily than trying to wedge in fixes for potential problems later on. Chuck wonders whether the current PP description is defunct or incomplete in some manner, thus making any experience gained from the current implementation moot. He identifies the largest hole in the implementation as the delivery of the Payment message. Chuck believes a malicious merchant could claim he never received the Payment message, or a faulty network connection could cause the message to never be delivered. In arbitration, the merchant could argue that the transactions seen on the network were insufficient. He thinks this could be a problem and needs to be addressed.</p>
