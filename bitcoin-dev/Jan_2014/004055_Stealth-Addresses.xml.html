    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea proposed is for individuals to upload a payment protocol file to their personal web page or share it via Dropbox, Google Drive, or a custom pastebin style service. This would allow them to encode a regular Bitcoin URI into a QR code on a billboard. However, this does require trusting the third party not to tamper with the payment request. Alternatively, one could attach a payment request to an email and send it to the receiver, allowing them to pay whenever they want. While email is an insecure channel, it is no worse than exchanging Bitcoin addresses over email as things currently stand.</p>
