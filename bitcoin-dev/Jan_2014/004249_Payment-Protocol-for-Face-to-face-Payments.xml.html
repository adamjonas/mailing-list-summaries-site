    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Andreas Schildbach has merged the code to his bitcoinj-0.11 branch and released binary .apk files for experimentation. To use it, one must tick "BIP70 for tap-to-pay/scan-to-pay" in the labs settings. He also presented his work on leveraging the payment protocol for face-to-face payments. The prototype is implemented on a branch of Bitcoin Wallet that uses bitcoinj 0.11, which is not yet released. The general assumption is that individuals don't own X.509 certificates and their devices may be only badly connected to the internet or not at all. The source code and binaries can be found on Github.</p>
