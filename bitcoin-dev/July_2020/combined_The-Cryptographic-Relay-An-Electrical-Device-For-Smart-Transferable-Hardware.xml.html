        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this article, the concept of a Cryptographic Relay is introduced as an electrical component that can enable control of an electrical circuit using a public key. The device can be used in various scenarios, such as rentable charging station projects for electric cars and collateralized loans on cryptographic cars. The article proposes the use of Cryptographic Relay features with support for MuSig, Timelocks, and Delegated operators. The rental contract process is explained using fresh keypairs, rent-transfer command, and rental-end command to transfer ownership from one party to another. Bitcoin-side payments are done via Lightning-with-PTLC, which requires Taproot but does not require SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. Furthermore, the article discusses scenarios where the device being rented out is a smart domicile and a deposit is involved. Smart contract languages should have PTLCs and partial signatures as primitives and be written in a compositional/declarative style.The proposed Cryptographic Relay device is simple and requires no consensus system, making it easy to implement and manufacture by multiple manufacturers. It allows for secure ownership transfer and delegation of operators, making it suitable for use in smart devices. The article also introduces the concept of Maxwell's Demon and how Cryptographic Relays can be used to check whether a car is still under ownership by verifying its blockchain history and checking if the time lock has expired.In the scenario of tight financial straits, a borrower may need to take out a loan using Bitcoin as collateral. With SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and Taproot, it is now possible to arrange a collateralized loan on a cryptographic car in a trustless manner. The loan shark and borrower generate two keypairs: one for the loan-out transaction and another for the loan-payback transaction. Once the loan is secured, the borrower can pay back the loan before the due date or risk losing their car to recoup the loan shark's losses.The article also discusses the importance of following ethical and legal practices while driving or dealing with cars. It condemns illegal activities related to stealing and hotwiring electric cars and emphasizes the need for standardization of Cryptographic Relays. The proposed device can be integrated into more complex applications, making it a versatile tool for secure and efficient lending.</p>
