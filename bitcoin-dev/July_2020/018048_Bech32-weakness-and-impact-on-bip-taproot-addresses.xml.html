    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing the possibility of amending BIP173 in preparation for taproot activation. Pieter Wuille suggests amending BIP173 to only permit lengths 20 and 32, while excluding shorter witness programs due to lack of entropy. However, Russell O'Connor proposes that insertions of five or more characters are safe and suggests allowing witness programs of lengths 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36, and 40 (or 39) to be addressable. He also proposes restricting the "bc" and "tb" segwit address formats to require witness programs of these sizes. Witness programs of other sizes would still be legal according to BIP 141, but would not be addressable with these prefixes. Another address format would be needed to support other witness sizes if necessary.</p>
