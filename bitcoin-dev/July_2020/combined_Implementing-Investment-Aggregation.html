        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposal aims to create a system that removes the necessity for custodial holding of funds, while still providing a way for small investors to lend money to businesses. The idea is to use non-custodial coordinators of multiple small investors who take on the risk of default, and also mention the use of collateralized loans and the Decker-Russell-Osuntokun mechanism for providing liquidity to borrowers.Investors remain in control of their funds until transferred to the lendee. Prior to investors signing the loan-out transaction, they prepare a loan-payback transaction which is signed with a SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT signature. This ensures that if the business is able to pay back its loan, the coordinator is never in custodial possession of funds. Investors may prefer to spread their risk by investing sub-sections of their savings into multiple different businesses, and each business can be given a loan-payback address controlled by the investors that extended their loans.The proposal mentions collateralized loans, where a Cryptographic Relay would allow multiple small investors to act as the "loan shark" in the example. Ownership remains controlled by individual investors, eliminating any custodial issues. However, coordinating the sale of collateral amongst multiple small investors in case of default may be harder. An additional service may be willing to pre-allocate Bitcoin funds into a timelocked contract, earning by arbitraging time preference.The email thread also discusses the Decker-Russell-Osuntokun ("eltoo") mechanism, which could be used for providing liquidity to borrowers in emergency situations. This mechanism would allow investors to liquidate their early position in the loan agreement, reducing their risk exposure while increasing that of the coordinator.Sophisticated risk analysis systems in the banking industry help banks reinvest a portion of their holdings and obtain profits to cover possible losses when borrowers cannot repay loans fully. This makes them more resilient to defaults and changes in collateral values, allowing borrowers to leverage 1 unit worth of collateral to get 3 units of funds instead of 1. However, it is unclear how this can be implemented by the coordinator and/or investors directly.Overall, the proposal suggests using features that allow for a non-custodial coordinator of multiple small investors who remain in control of their funds until transferred to the lendee. Investors need to trust some bank in addition to trusting the businesses taking on loans to start/expand their business, but this proposal removes the necessity for custodial holding of funds. The traditional banking system provides more than just custodial holding of funds in terms of lending and borrowing as one important function is to match long term investments with short or variable term deposits.</p>
