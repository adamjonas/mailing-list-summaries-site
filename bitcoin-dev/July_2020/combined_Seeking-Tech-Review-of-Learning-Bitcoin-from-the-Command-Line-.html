        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Blockchain Commons has requested help from Bitcoin experts to review and offer feedback on their popular course, Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line. The course is designed to provide an intermediate level of understanding between introductory courses and more intensive workshops. It teaches fundamental RPC commands for interacting with Bitcoin Core using bitcoin-cli command line and other programming languages via RPC.The organization has added new sections on descriptors, Segwit, P2WPKH, Segwit Scripting, PSBTs, HWI, and Tor to the course. Blockchain Commons is looking for fact-checking, comments, corrections, and financial support through Github sponsorship starting at $20/month or one-time Bitcoin contributions directly at their BTCPay server. The course is aimed at individuals who want to learn how to interact with Bitcoin's core software in a more advanced manner than introductory courses. By teaching essential RPC commands, the course provides an understanding of how Bitcoin transactions work under the hood. Blockchain Commons is a non-profit organization that aims to promote open-source projects related to blockchain technology. With the help of Bitcoin experts, the organization hopes to improve its course and provide a better learning experience for students interested in Bitcoin.</p>
