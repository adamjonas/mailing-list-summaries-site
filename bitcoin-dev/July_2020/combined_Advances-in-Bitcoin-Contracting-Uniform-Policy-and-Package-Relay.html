        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Higher-layer protocols such as vaults, LN, CoinJoin, and watchtowers have different demands and assumptions regarding tx-relay and fee models. The security of these protocols relies on timely confirmations of transactions. Lightning is the most deployed time-sensitive protocol currently, and it achieves transaction confirmation by propagating well-transactions across the network to quickly hit miner mempools and offering a competitive feerate to get in next coming blocks. Updating feerate just-in-time can be challenging for LN due to constraints of maintaining a trustless chain of transactions. Effective transaction propagation and uniform relay policy are crucial for the laid-out security model. Compliance with consensus rules and policy rules determines the effectiveness of transaction propagation across the p2p network.Heterogeneity in policy rules across implementations/versions can be problematic for higher protocols since it can silently break the security of channels if your LN's full-node is connected to tx-relay peers with more constraining policies than yours. Therefore, there is a need to identify and document the subset of policy rules on which upper layers have to rely on to enforce their security model and guarantee backward-compatibility of those rules. Committing to a uniform policy would incentivize upper layer devs to rely on such stable APIs, and full-node operators would follow such uniform policy to improve effective feerate discovery by their mempools.Adversarial fee bumping and package relay pose a problem for transaction propagation and uniform relay policy. To solve this, it may be necessary to deploy a package relay that provides a censorship-resistant, reliable highway across the p2p network to always increase the feerate of blockspace bids. In conclusion, upper layers of the Bitcoin stack require that single full-nodes behave in a homogeneous way such that the base network as a whole system provides a trustworthy propagation/fee bumping API.</p>
