        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On July 14th, a user sent an email to the lightning-dev mailing list seeking clarification on how the Lightning Network works regarding HTLCs and settlements on the blockchain. The user was concerned about losing money if their HTLC does not get confirmed or if an older HTLC gets confirmed first. They outlined three potential scenarios where this could happen: if the blockchain is saturated with transactions, if there is competition from a different conflicting HTLC, or if there is a denial of service attack on the lightning router preventing settlement HTLCs from being sent. The user also mentioned a recent attack technique called "flood and loot" that may be similar to their concerns.In response, ZmnSCPxj explained that moving transactions off the blockchain reduces the risk of economic loss due to delay, which can occur when on-chain transfers take a long time to settle. They also refuted the possibility of conflicting HTLCs and explained the risk of denial of service attacks. Flood and Loot is a similar attack technique where uneconomically small HTLCs are used to forward circular routes to the victim forwarding node, but it is too expensive to claim them on-chain. ZmnSCPxj acknowledged that Lightning Network is susceptible to such attacks, but anchor commitments are being developed to mitigate their effects on-chain fees. Channel factories do not eliminate concerns about security costs as security always comes at a cost. Ultimately, one has to pay for protection in transactions with potentially untrusted entities.The purpose of Lightning Network is to move transactions off the blockchain and reduce pressure on it, so the risk of economic loss due to delay is lowered. The settlement speed on both offchain and onchain is improved in this way. However, the user's concerns remain valid, and the risk of flood and loot attacks is still present.</p>
