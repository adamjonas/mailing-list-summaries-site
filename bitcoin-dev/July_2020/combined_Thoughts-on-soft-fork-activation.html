        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing the best way to activate soft forks in the future. Two proposals have emerged as plausible options. The first is a recent update to BIP 8 by Luke, which has a relatively short time frame for users to upgrade if mandatory activation is desired without a supermajority of hashpower enforcing the rules. The second approach is based on a more complicated and slower method described by Matt in January, which provides a longer timeline.The design constraints that developers want include a quick activation if everyone cooperates and no one objects, no obvious exploits, and plausible contingency plans in place to discourage people from using the attempt to deploy a new soft fork as a way of attacking bitcoin.Matt Corallo expressed his disappointment with the discussion of naive flag day fork activation in the form of BIP 9. He argues that activation of forks sets a community understanding and culture around how changes to Bitcoin should be made. He acknowledges significant outreach efforts and design work to ensure Taproot is broadly acceptable to Bitcoin users but notes that not all Bitcoin users are aware of these efforts or their results. Additionally, he expresses concern over the optics that set the stage for how future changes are made to Bitcoin purely because miners may be too busy with other things to upgrade their nodes.Anthony Towns proposed two plausible ways to activate soft forks in the future: Luke's recent update to BIP 8 and Towns' own approach based on Matt's method, which gradually decreases the threshold during the second signaling period. While acknowledging the merit in decreasing the activation threshold during the second signaling period, Corallo argues that to not make every attempt to distance the activation method from the public perception unilateral activation is a mistake.Developers hope activating taproot will go smoothly, but they are not 100% sure of it. Starting with something simple and being ready to adapt if/when things start to go weird seems like a good approach. Overall, coordination and communication will be key to successfully activating Taproot.In a recent proposal circulating on IRC and supported by gmax and roconnor, it is suggested to deploy a BIP8 `lockinontimeout=true` `lockin=+42 months` at the next release. If it is not activated within a year after `starttime`, then discussion will take place to either enforce the BIP8 bit with a reduced-threshold 80% through BIP91 or deploy an abort which disallows transaction outputs with `OP_1` `scriptPubKey`. This proposal aligns with aj's suggestion of deploying a BIP8 `lockinontimeout=true` that ends +42 months after the first countdown, along with an abort that is equivalent to not deploying Taproot after the 6-month discussion period. The proposal offers advantages such as allowing for quick deployment of a simple BIP8 `locktimeontimeout=true`, while continuing debates on various details. It enables users to start deploying it and provides better gauges on how well Taproot is supported. Coordination and communication will be key to successfully activating Taproot, and users may need to adapt if things start to go wrong.</p>
