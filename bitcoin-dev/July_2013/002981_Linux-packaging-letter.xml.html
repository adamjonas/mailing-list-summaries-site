    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 23, 2013, Mike Hearn wrote an open letter to the Linux packaging community asking them not to patch or modify Bitcoin's upstream sources. He requested readers to sign the letter if they agree with it. A link to the letter was provided in his email. However, some minor changes had been signed off by Gavin, Pieter, and Jgarzik that were not entirely in sync with the letter. The issue was not as significant as the fact that the letter was being rewritten by "anonymous beaver" and friends.</p>
