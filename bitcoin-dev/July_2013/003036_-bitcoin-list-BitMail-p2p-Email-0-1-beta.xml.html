    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an independent security chip that becomes more useful when integrated with features on the motherboard, BIOS, CPU, northbridge, and IOMMU. When combined, these components create a full-blown TCG-compliant TC environment that can be used for many things. Although there was speculation that TPM could be useful for digital rights management (DRM), this feature was never implemented, and cryptography is to DRM as TC is to DRM. The FUD surrounding TPM was unwarranted and undermined its usefulness as a cryptographic security tool. AMD has TPM, although it is unclear which models support it. Version control is standard for application code but not databases; however, steps can be taken to put SQL databases under version control.</p>
