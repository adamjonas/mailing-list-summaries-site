    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post by Mike Hearn, he suggests that packagers should listen to upstreams who complain about packaging. He believes that some of them probably know what they're talking about and shouldn't have to beg and plead for their concerns to be heard. However, the assertion without explanation won't work as many people think their code is more special than it actually is. But in the case of bitcoin, there is a valid reason for the complaints. The issue is that the bitcoin software has a large number of dependencies and requires a specific version of these dependencies to function properly. This means that packagers must take extra care to ensure that they are packaging the correct versions of the dependencies, which can be time-consuming and difficult. Hearn suggests that it would be helpful if upstreams provided more information about their dependencies and why specific versions are required. This would help packagers better understand the reasons behind the requests and make the packaging process smoother. Ultimately, Hearn believes that communication and cooperation between upstreams and packagers is key to making sure that software is packaged correctly and efficiently.</p>
