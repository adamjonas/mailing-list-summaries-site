    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses various ideas to prevent a theoretical attack on Bitcoin. One of the ideas is to use Tor SOCKS proxy that creates an independent circuit to a different exit node each time you connect, which gets back to the clearnet heuristic of validating transactions. Another idea is to have a set of hard-coded long term stable hidden peers run by known community members who are not going to collaborate to defraud people. The third suggestion would involve talking directly with the Tor protocol to pick its own diverse set of exit nodes, one per p2p connection. Although it's a theoretical attack as of now, the author is not aware of any countries that block Bitcoin. Supporting SOCKS (blocking sockets) would be a good thing anyway, and using blocking sockets would also mean getting SSL support.</p>
