    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a thread on the mailing list, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn suggests that the Bitcoin letter should be changed before being shown to package maintainers. He thinks the current version of the letter might be perceived as high-handed and telling someone else how to do their job without noticing the actual facts included in the letter. Without a careful read, this letter sounds much like a cry from other authors who say their software is different and more important and packager maintainers have to do things their way. Zooko suggests soliciting the cooperation of a few package maintainers and writing a joint letter with them signing on. It would be a shared statement by both Bitcoin devs and packagers and would be phrased in language that would make it instantly clear to other packagers that this isn't just another whine from ignorant devs. He proposes contacting some packagers and asking them to suggest edits that would make it into the kind of letter that they'd sign their name to. At the very least, they'd learn something from the ensuing conversation.</p>
