    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Peter Todd discusses the possibility of implementing a new idea with Wendell Davis, who suggests that Todd may want to consider bringing in someone else to handle the programming if he lacks confidence in his skills. Davis offers Eric Lombrozo as a potential candidate for the job. Todd responds by stating that he has more good ideas than time to implement them, but admits that he is considering the project. He also mentions that he accepted funds from John Dillon to implement replace-by-fee, and suggests that anyone interested in offering bribes should look at his git commit track record. Todd notes that he has been more of an academic than a programmer.</p>
