    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd discussed the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the introduction of OP_DEPTH in scripts. Satoshi had expressed concern that long chains of transactions could become invalid and impossible to include in the blockchain again in the event of a re-org, but Todd argued that this was not a valid concern since it was equally possible through tx mutability or double-spends. However, accepting any payment still required taking the chance of a re-org into account and waiting for more confirms for larger payments. Todd also gave an example of a probabalistic payment vulnerable to double-spends in a number of ways. In addition, mempool and relay code would need to protect against tx-flood DoS attacks by accounting for the possibility that a transaction may not be possible to include in the block after the next one. This would become an important issue if IsStandard() were loosened.</p>
