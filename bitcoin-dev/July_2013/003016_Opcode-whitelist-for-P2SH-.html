    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 29, 2013, Luke-Jr wrote to Jeff Garzik regarding whitelist for specific opcodes that would apply to scripts serialized using P2SH. John Dillon suggested this idea and asked for Luke's opinion on it. Luke-Jr believes that this approach could be reasonable for miners. However, a much smarter solver would be required for interoperability between wallets. Without a smart solver, specific standard forms would still be necessary. Current designs are all based around pattern matching a script template, and Satoshi even described lightweight clients as needing no script engine at all, only the ability to match patterns.
