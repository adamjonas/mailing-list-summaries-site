    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the issue of packaging Bitcoin software by packagers who may not be experts in the field, causing inconsistent quality and introducing subtle bugs. The initial draft of a letter to package maintainers was brusque, but subsequent versions were created to address the concerns of packagers who may perceive the letter as high-handed. The intention of the letter was to acknowledge the good motivations for existing norms while explaining why Bitcoin is unique. The discussion aims to reduce initial bristling and open the conversation to start understanding the concern shared by many people. There is tension between upstreams and packagers with different priorities and backgrounds, but disagreements usually result in better outcomes for everyone. The email ends with an advertisement for AppDynamics, which provides end-to-end visibility with application monitoring.</p>
