    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, several topics related to Bitcoin mining are discussed. Jorge Timón argues that the pegging of Bitcoin and Zerocoin would result in additional costs for the Bitcoin network, while Peter suggests a system that requires no changes to the Bitcoin codebase, thus avoiding any extra costs. The conversation then shifts to merge mining, with Timón arguing that it is not mining a coin for free because the total reward should tend to equal the mining costs. However, Gregory Maxwell argues that merge mining is very much mining a coin for free since there is little protection from miners who mine invalid blocks. Finally, Maxwell's expertise on crypto-coin theory is recommended as being "spot-on correct."</p>
