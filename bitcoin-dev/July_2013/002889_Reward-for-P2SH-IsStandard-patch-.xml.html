    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list conversation, John Dillon suggests that the usage of P2SH with an inner OP_CHECKSIG for most addresses would be beneficial long-term, as it saves 1 byte. He suggests that change addresses can have this done first, and that bitcoinj support will help sites such as satoshidice pay to P2SH change. For multisig's P2SH overhead for a 1-of-2 and 2-of-2 and 3-of-3, is 10%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, all minor, especially if the blocksize limit is assumed to be raised. Pieter also adds a small comment stating that the current implementation in the reference client uses a custom script encoder for the UTXO database, which stores every (valid) send-to-pubkey as 33 bytes and every send-to-pubkeyhash or send-to-scripthash as 21 bytes. Therefore, for "standard" address payment, there is no storage impact of using P2SH instead.</p>
