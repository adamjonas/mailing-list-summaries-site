    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Mike Hearn and an unknown recipient dated July 15, 2013, shows that the recipient was concerned about synchronizing time as one of their main frustration points. They expressed interest in extending Jeff Garzik's picocoin but the plan had not yet been concrete. Mike responded by suggesting that they transpile bitcoinj, which is ideal for their purposes, to fix the synchronization issue. However, he warned that being based on bitcoind causes a delay in synchronizing time for new users, resulting in many users dropping out. SPV mode would be the best solution for this problem, with bitcoinj being the only implementation known so far. Mike was experimenting with transpiling bitcoinj to C++ to make it usable from Objective-C++.</p>
