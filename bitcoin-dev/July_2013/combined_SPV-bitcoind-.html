        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach, the topic of the average connection time for the Bitcoin app was discussed. Andreas explained that the current programming allows for connections to remain open for an additional two minutes after receiving a block, and eight minutes after sending or receiving a transaction. This feature is designed to give the chain time to catch up while avoiding excessive battery drain.Furthermore, the app keeps connections open as long as the screen is on and the app is in the foreground. This means that when users are actively using the app, such as on the send and request coins screens or the network monitor, the connections will remain open. Mike Hearn raised the issue of SPV wallets and their usage patterns. He suggested gathering telemetry from the Android wallet to determine how long SPV wallets typically remain open. He believes that most users only keep their wallets open to check if they have received or sent money. To gain insights into this, he proposed allowing users to opt-in to usage statistics.Andreas agreed to look into implementing the option for users to opt-in to usage statistics. This would provide valuable data on how long SPV wallets stay open and help address Mike's concerns about the number of open wallets. By gathering this information, they hope to make informed decisions regarding potential improvements, such as the idea of partial UTXO sets suggested by Mike.Overall, this conversation highlights the considerations around connection times for the Bitcoin app and the need for data on SPV wallet usage. By understanding user behavior and preferences, the developers can make informed adjustments and enhancements to ensure optimal performance and user experience.</p>
