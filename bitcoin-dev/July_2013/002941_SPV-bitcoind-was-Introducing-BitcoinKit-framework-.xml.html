    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange from 2013, Wendell proposed an idea to Peter Todd for a desktop client that would only use a fraction of available disk space. Peter responded that he has a lot of good ideas and he is considering this one. However, he joked that he would accept bribes but also explained that he had previously accepted funds from John Dillon to implement replace-by-fee. Peter suggested looking at his git commit track record before making any offers. The email also included a digital signature as an attachment.</p>
