    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context, Zooko has sent an email to Jeff Garzik thanking him for his work on a new digestible alternative and asks some questions. Zooko's first question is in relation to a part of the text that states "Make a mistake, lose $1 billion". He wants to know what behavior a dependency or patch could cause that would be problematic and if this could spell the end of Bitcoin. In response, he suggests using a statement made earlier by Luke-Jr in the thread which explains that in some cases, a bitcoin node needs certain bugs or limitations to maintain consensus with other nodes without elaborating on the specific cases. Zooko's second question relates to the consequence of a dependency or patch going wrong. He believes there is a risk of double-spending attacks and blockchain forks. The process for healing a blockchain fork is not well understood.</p>
