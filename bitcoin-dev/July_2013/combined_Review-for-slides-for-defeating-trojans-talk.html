        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In 2013, Rob Meijer completed the first draft of his presentation slides and speaker notes for his talk titled "Defeating Trojans" at OHM2013. He used BitCoin as one of the main examples to emphasize the importance of programs like BitCoin having their own private storage apart from $HOME. To ensure that he didn't misrepresent BitCoin, he asked for someone to review his slides.Rob plans to use BitCoin as the main example in his talk to highlight the significance of having separate private storage for programs like BitCoin. He requests help reviewing his open office slides to avoid misrepresenting BitCoin. In an email thread discussing BitCoin development, Rob Meijer writes about his completed slides and asks for assistance in reviewing them. The email thread also includes an advertisement for AppDynamics, an application monitoring tool. Rob is willing to email his slides to anyone who can help him with the review.</p>
