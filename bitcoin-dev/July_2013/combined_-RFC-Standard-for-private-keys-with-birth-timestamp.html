        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Pieter Wuille proposed a method to encode keys data using the "@" character as a separator for birth timestamps on July 22, 2013. He suggested not incorporating this encoding method into key serialization as birth timestamps are generally a property of an address rather than the key it is derived from. This proposal would be useful for non-extended standard serialized private keys and P2SH addresses. The reason for choosing '@' is that it's not present in the base58, hex, or base64 encodings typically used for key/script data. Although there is no checksum-protection for the timestamp, there is increased genericity. Additionally, the optional part is longer than using binary encoding, but human typing is already challenging enough. Someone on the mailing list suggested looking at RFC 4151, which had an idea on adding time stamps to identifiers. However, they believed that the sacrifice in opacity did not seem to justify the utility.</p>
