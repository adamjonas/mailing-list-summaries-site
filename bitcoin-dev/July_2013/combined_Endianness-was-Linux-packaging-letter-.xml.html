        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin codebase, a user named Wendell asked if there was a substantial barrier to endian independence. The response was that there wasn't really a barrier, as the software was originally written to write out memory order to and from the wire, which is why the protocol is LE (little-endian) everywhere. However, fixing endianness is still necessary, but it's a typical fix. One issue with Bitcoin is that almost everything sent and received is an authenticated data structure, so simply swizzling the byte order immediately on input isn't enough. Sometimes, the data needs to be hashed for authentication, and it cannot be in memory order for that.Luke attempted to fix the issue a long time ago, but it wasn't enough yet. The undertaking for fixing endianness seems like it's just enough that without a good reason to care about it, no real progress has been made. Gregory Maxwell chimed in, correcting the previous statement by saying it's not LE (little-endian) everywhere, but rather "manywhere" since there's just enough BE (big-endian) to keep people on their toes.</p>
