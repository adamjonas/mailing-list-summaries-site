    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation dated July 30, 2013, Mike Hearn suggested that it would be interesting to talk directly to the Tor protocol and have an application explicitly choose its own diverse set of exit nodes. However, this is likely to be complicated as Tor does not provide any library or API. The idea was discussed on IRC, and some believed that linking directly with a Tor library would be superior for several applications compared to requiring a properly configured external process. Without such a Tor library, one must be written. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., provided the context of this conversation.</p>
