    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The controversy around Bitcoin sacrifice is not an issue, as there's no modification required for Bitcoin and nothing can be done to prevent it. The real problem lies in sacrificing something outside Bitcoin's chain and new Bitcoin appearing. Merged mining may seem free but following the rules and mining the other coin is more profitable. Proof of work is designed for rational actors, and miners who don't merge mine Namecoin are irrational agents. Prime proof of work is interesting as it moves towards SCIP-based mining. SCIP-based merged mining would be the win. Alt-currencies that do not peg into Bitcoin have low liquidity, making it difficult to float a new pair. Automated BitcoinZerocoin P2P trading without an exchange is desirable from a privacy standpoint as it reduces the privacy risks of doing the exchange to spending the Zerocoins in the first place.</p>
