    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Daniel F and Jim on July 9, 2013, Jim mentioned that the MultiBit download would increase from about 11MB to 30-40MB. This would decrease the maximum number of copies the multibit.org server could deliver per day from around 90,000 to 30,000ish. The multibit.org server could only handle a maximum of 1TB of bandwidth per day.Daniel F suggested that they could host their downloads on sourceforge, which would provide virtually unlimited capacity for open-source software downloads. Jeff Garzik, Senior Software Engineer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., agreed with this suggestion and stated that there is no need to worry about download bandwidth for open source software these days. He advised them to move the downloads to a site where such worries do not exist.</p>
