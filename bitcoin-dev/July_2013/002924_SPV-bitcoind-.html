    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Android apps are programmed to become active upon installation and inactive when uninstalled. However, when receiving a block, they stay connected for at least two more minutes to allow the chain to catch up while avoiding battery drain. Upon sending or receiving a transaction, they stay connected for at least eight more minutes as it is likely that the wallet will see more activity. Moreover, on the send and request coins screens and the network monitor, the app stays connected for as long as the screen is on and the app is in the foreground (i.e., resumed state). Mike Hearn suggests the idea of partial UTXO sets, but he has concerns about how many SPV wallets remain open. He believes that most users only keep their wallets open to check if they have received or sent money. Therefore, he wants to get telemetry from the Android wallet and asks Andreas to let users opt-in to usage statistics.</p>
