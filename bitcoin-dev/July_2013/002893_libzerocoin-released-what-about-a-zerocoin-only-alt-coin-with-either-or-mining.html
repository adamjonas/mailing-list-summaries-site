    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread is discussing merge mining. The initial post states that merge mining can be seen as mining a coin for free, considering the marginal cost of mining an additional coin. However, another user points out that there may exist miners for which the value of the coin is negative. Additionally, without a cost to mining an invalid block, the merge mined coin is vulnerable to malicious or negligent miners. The discussion continues with some debate about the protection against invalid blocks, and the importance of having a cost to encourage miners to pay attention to what they mine. The conversation then shifts to the topic of proof-of-sacrifice, which is seen as a stronger defense against 51% attacks than proof-of-work mining. This is because it allows conjuring up mining capacity on demand but only by those who have a stake in the crypto-coin. However, this defense still depends on the existence of a proof-of-work chain. Finally, the email ends on a positive note, acknowledging someone's use of PGP signature.</p>
