    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr discussed creating a whitelist for specific opcodes that would apply to scripts serialized using P2SH while retaining the existing standard whitelist for scriptPubKeys. John Dillon suggested dropping pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-multisig due to their potential for dumping data in the UTXO set. However, Luke-Jr stated that some specific standard forms would still be necessary for interoperability between wallets without a much smarter solver. Current designs are all based on pattern matching a script template. The discussion included two use-cases: wallets protected by authorization tokens for multi-factor security and allowing funds to be controlled by oracles that attest that events have happened allowing the funds to move. The latter application especially demands a specialized wallet, yet can only possibly work with non-standard script formats. Bringing the issue of wallet standardization into this discussion is silly and premature according to them. Until the txout is spent all *any* wallet sees is a P2SH address with no information as to what scriptPubKey is needed to spend it.</p>
