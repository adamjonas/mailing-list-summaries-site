    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Daniel F and Mike Hearn discuss the possibility of using SourceForge.net (SF.net) to serve new users and provide auto updates for Bitcoin software. Mike expresses concerns about SF.net's user interface and potential security risks associated with their mirror network, stating that it would be better to continue using their own servers as they have enough bandwidth. Daniel suggests that if there is a need for additional capacity, SF.net could be used without having to spend money. He also argues that security issues and user interface are not relevant for auto updates, which will likely create lumpy download demand. The email concludes with an advertisement for AppDynamics, which provides end-to-end application monitoring.</p>
