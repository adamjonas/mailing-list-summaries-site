    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The thread in question was accidentally posted on the announce list instead of the development list, and the poster wondered why it was open access. The topic under discussion was TPM functionality and why it received so much negative attention in the past, with some attributing this to the fact that it was pushed by a software/hardware monopoly for purposes of DRM and locking down systems. However, the published specifications and technologies were never intended for such uses, and there has never been a TC/TPM mode that would have generally locked systems down or been useful for DRM. Locking a system down for tampering or DRM does not require flexible open specifications with multiple competing implementations, but rather an approach like the Xbox 360's.</p>
