    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Andreas Schildbach asked whether the UTXO set of a given address is planned to be exposed. The idea was that it would be useful for SPV wallets to be able to sweep a previously unknown private key, such as found on a paper wallet. Pieter Wuille responded that while maintaining an address/script-indexed UTXO is generally useful, this isn't really useful for SPV nodes, as there is no way to authenticate this data. If you can fake a UTXO entry, you can make a peer believe anything about their balance, potentially resulting in creating a valid transaction that sends change it didn't know was there as fee to miners.</p>
