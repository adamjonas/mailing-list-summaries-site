    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on July 23, 2013, Pieter Wuille discussed the possibility of exposing the UXTO set of a given address for use in SPV wallets. However, he noted that this could potentially lead to security issues as there is no way to authenticate the data without at least partial validation. He suggested using an address-indexed committed merkle UTXO-set tree to do this securely but acknowledged that it would put a significant burden on validation nodes. Regarding sweeping paper wallets, Wuille said it was a common feature request and suggested that an address-indexed UXTO would be enough for the use case. He also discussed the idea of paper wallets that include the necessary additional information but pointed out some potential issues with this approach.</p>
