    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Multibit, a Java application serving HTML, was recommended as a fast Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) client for Bitcoin users. However, Java's security issues have made it an instant "uninstall" item on Windows PCs for about a year now. Java exploits are very common and even manually disabling the browser plugin is not a viable solution as many users do not know how to do so. Until Multibit is provided as a compiled binary without a Java dependency, it is unlikely to gain popularity as a first wallet option. To address user support issues, Multibit created a dedicated Support page on their website, which has fixes and support notes for common issues. The in-app help also now has a 'Support' section with "Troubleshooting' and the most common issues. If users still require more assistance, they are directed to bitcoin.stackchange.com or the Github issues to search for existing or raise a new issue. Developers who wish to contribute can refer to the supporting documentation on the Multibit website found at <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit-website">https://github.com/jim618/multibit-website</a>. In other news, Multibit was suggested to replace Bitcoin-Qt as the recommended desktop wallet app by Gavin Andresen. He believed that most users would be happier with Multibit, but acknowledged that it was easy to change back if necessary.</p>
