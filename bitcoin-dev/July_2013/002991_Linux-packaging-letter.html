    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Douglas Huff and Scott Howard in July 2013, the topic of certifying Debian libraries was discussed. Initially, Huff was not in favor of the idea as he believed that maintainers often dealt with similar issues mentioned in the proposal. However, Howard suggested running a compile test during all architectures to ensure that the technology could be redistributed at some point. During the discussion, it was revealed that big endian binaries had been packaged and shipped, which was deemed negligent and ineffective. It should be noted that the discussion was specifically referring to little-endian MIPS, or debian-mipsel.</p>
