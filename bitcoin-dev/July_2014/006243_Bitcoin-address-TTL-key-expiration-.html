    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message from 2014, Bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn discussed the limitations of BIP70 in relation to future payments of unpredictable value. He stated that it was essential to limit the lifetime of a Bitcoin address, as mobile clients could run out of RAM and have to cycle around and reuse addresses. This is why BIP70 has a feature that addresses this issue. Hearn believed that addresses were an evolutionary dead end and that eventually, places using addresses would need to upgrade to use BIP70 instead. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, was also included in the message.</p>
