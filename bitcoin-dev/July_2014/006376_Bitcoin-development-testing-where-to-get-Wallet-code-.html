    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Caleb and Felipe Micaroni Lalli revolved around Bitcoin development. Caleb expressed his interest in contributing to Bitcoin development for learning purposes and asked for guidance on where to get started. He mentioned that he wanted to contribute to unit and other types of tests, understand the Bitcoin code, and write a Bitcoin wallet in another language. Felipe was also interested in implementing Bitcoin in Clojure or Scheme and shared a link to a related question on bitcoin.stackexchange.com. Caleb did not confirm whether he wanted to tackle writing Bitcoin in Clojure, but said that he wanted to create a toolkit first to learn more about how it works. The conversation ended with Caleb sharing his contact information.</p>
