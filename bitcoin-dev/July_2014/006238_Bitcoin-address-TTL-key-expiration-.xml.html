    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A request has been made to limit the lifetime of a bitcoin address. The limitation would be useful and essential as mobile clients can run out of RAM and have to cycle around and reuse addresses. BIP70 already has this feature as it was thought about quite some time ago. Addresses are considered an evolutionary dead end and they will never do everything we need them to do. If there is anywhere that is still using addresses, it is somewhere that will eventually need to upgrade to use BIP70 instead.</p>
