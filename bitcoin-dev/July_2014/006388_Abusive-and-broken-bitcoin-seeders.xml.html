    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin developer, provides some insight on request volume and abuse through his public node at statoshi.info. His node receives a "getaddr" request every 50 seconds and the volume of "addr" messages it sends out is also low. Lopp believes that "getaddr" requests are not resource-intensive since they do not read from disk. However, he offers to add timing metrics around these requests if necessary.In response to Lopp's comment, Mike Hearn mentions that the web has managed to survive despite constant fast crawls for the past ten years or so and suggests not worrying too much about this unless it can be proven that a big chunk of the nodes' resources are going to answering ver queries. This discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in July of 2014.</p>
