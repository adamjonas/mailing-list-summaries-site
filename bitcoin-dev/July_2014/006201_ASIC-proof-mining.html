    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Cryptonote-based BCN recently had some updates which made it easier for ordinary computers to handle. Mike Hearn suggested the possibility of allocating a portion of the reward to "a # of runner up(s)" even if their block gets orphaned, but there is no concept of a "runner up" as hashing is progress free. The better concept is to reward "near miss" solutions, which is done through pools that pay for shares that almost meet the difficulty target. The question is how to implement pools with this reward structure without miners giving up their right to block creation due to technical problems or sheer laziness.</p>
