    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about a seasoned software developer who wants to contribute to Bitcoin for learning purposes. He wants to work on unit and/or other types of tests and understand the Bitcoin code from top to bottom. Additionally, he wants to write a Bitcoin wallet in another language. The developer needs direction on where to get started and tools and frameworks he would need to work on tests and look at the Bitcoin core and wallet code. He also wants to know if there is a separate area for core wallet development on Github and mailing lists. On a related note, Felipe Micaroni Lalli, Bitcoin Paranoid Android developer, expresses his interest in implementing Bitcoin in Clojure or Scheme and shares his PGP ID and BTC address. Caleb Roger Davis responds to the email with questions and requests for information.</p>
