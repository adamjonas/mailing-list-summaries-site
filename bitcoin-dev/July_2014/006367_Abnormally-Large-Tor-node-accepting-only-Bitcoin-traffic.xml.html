    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 28, 2014, Peter Todd wrote about a Bitcoin-only exit node with no traffic leaving it. Todd suspected that the node was connected to an abnormally large percentage of the Bitcoin network and was likely part of a Sybil attack attempting to hide behind a Tor exit node. However, another user did not believe this was a Sybil attack since there was only one IP address. The user also argued that this behavior could be beneficial for transaction and block propagation and that monitoring transaction origins using multiple IPs would be more like an actual Sybil attack.</p>
