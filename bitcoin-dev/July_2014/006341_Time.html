    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of breadwallet, an iOS application, is based on the block height, not the timestamp. If a user has access to the device and it is not pin locked, they can jailbreak it and obtain access to the wallet seed. However, if the device is pin locked, the filesystem is hardware AES encrypted to a combination of pin+uuid, making it reasonably secure. This prevents multiple pin guesses by changing system time in settings, so it is not the weakest part of the security model. Although breadwallet is an iOS application, attaching to its process requires root access, which is more difficult than convincing the device to change its system time. Nonetheless, the security benefits may not be too significant.</p>
