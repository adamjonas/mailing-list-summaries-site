    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and a specific issue raised by the user. The BIP suggests querying multiple nodes and combining their answers as a partial solution to the issue, which the user found unhelpful for their question #2 and received no response for question #3. The user suggests adding a warning label and discussing the choice of using a trusted third party, but the respondent explains that the ability to use a trusted third party is always present and does not need stating. However, the respondent agrees to add a sentence suggesting an alternative option of querying a block explorer or other trusted third party if the constraints are insufficient for the user's use case, to make the BIP clearer.</p>
