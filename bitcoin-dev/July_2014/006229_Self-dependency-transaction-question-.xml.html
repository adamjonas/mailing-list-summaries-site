    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Richard Moore raised a question regarding the validity of self-referencing transactions in an email sent on July 13, 2014. He asked if a transaction X whose input was X and had an output Y would result in Y being a valid UTXO (unspent transaction output) without being a generation transaction input. However, even if such a transaction did exist and was valid, it still couldn't create new coins. This is because the sum of the outputs must be less than or equal to the sum of the inputs, except for coinbase transactions. If a transaction spent its own output, the input would be completely used up by the output, leaving no balance for a second output.</p>
