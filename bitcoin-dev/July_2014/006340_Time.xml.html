    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on July 24, 2014, Gregory Maxwell questioned the security of breadwallet, asking if it was tamper-resistant or had zero-tamper hardware. He expressed concerns about the possibility of attaching a debugger to the process or modifying the program and ignoring the block sourced time. In response, it was mentioned that breadwallet is an iOS application, making it substantially more difficult to attach to a process, which requires root access and other things on iOS. However, it was also suggested that the security benefits may not be significant.</p>
