        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses the issue of abusive behavior in the Bitcoin network, where some connections are sending frequent requests. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, expresses concern over some nodes rapidly connecting to the same node, taking up public slots. Other seeders are also rapidly reconnecting, although with a slightly wider time window. The version message sent by these connections reveals the user's IP address but not the sender's, which raises concerns about DDoS attacks and deep scans to gather information that can harm the Bitcoin network.Wladimir expresses frustration that the version message only displays their own IP address but not that of their peers. They suggest using "-logips" to log peer IPs, but note that this feature was disabled by default after issue #3764. Additionally, they mention experiencing abusive behavior and question why requests need to be so frequent.The context involves a discussion between two individuals, one of whom believes that the requests Jeff is seeing came from their crawler at 148.251.238.178, which takes a full snapshot of the network of reachable nodes every 3 to 4 minutes. However, anyone could be running it since there is no IP address in the log to confirm the source of the requests. The individual provides a sample log of an actual request from their crawler and explains that they want to be able to diff between the snapshots to get the join and leave nodes periodically. They also mention having a task in their schedule to improve upon this method by skipping a new connection with currently reachable nodes while still being able to perform the diff.Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin developer, provides some insight on request volume and abuse through his public node at statoshi.info. His node receives a "getaddr" request every 50 seconds and the volume of "addr" messages it sends out is also low. Lopp believes that "getaddr" requests are not resource-intensive since they do not read from disk. However, he offers to add timing metrics around these requests if necessary.Mike Hearn mentions that the web has managed to survive despite constant fast crawls for the past ten years or so and suggests not worrying too much about this unless it can be proven that a big chunk of the nodes' resources are going to answering ver queries. The possibility of dealing with constant fast crawls in the future has been expressed by an individual who is unsure of how to handle it. However, it has been noted that the web has managed to survive despite this being the norm for the past decade. Therefore, there is no immediate need for concern unless a significant amount of resources are being used to answer queries.Overall, the discussion highlights the concerns regarding abusive behavior in the Bitcoin network and the need for authentication of connections. It also suggests possible solutions to improve the current system and prevent potential harm to the network.</p>
