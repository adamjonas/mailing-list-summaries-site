    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The timestamp on the blockchain provides an extra piece of reliable data that is not being exploited by applications. This 'time', as agreed upon by more than 50% of participants, can be kept fairly accurate within a +/- 10 minute time window. The validity of the blockchain can be tested with cryptographic proofs and a review of difficulty growth/decline. Using the blockchain as an approximate time source gives a worldwide consensus without direct trust of any player. Reliable 'time' has been impossible up until now, but using the blockchain as an approximate time source gives a world wide consensus without direct trust of any player. Bitcoin core developers and open source evangelists, like Jeff Garzik, are working to exploit this potential use of the blockchain.</p>
