    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Kaz Wesley and Gavin Andresen, they discuss the possibility of creating a new mining-only network for faster block propagation. Wesley suggests that if there is support for his proposal, he can work on implementing the details such as bloom filters, message format, and capability advertisement, and draft a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) once he has a concrete proposal and cost-benefit analysis. However, Andresen encourages him to code up a prototype first in whatever programming language and networking library he's most familiar with. Additionally, Andresen suggests the idea of a separate mining-only very-fast-block-propagation network, which when combined with Wesley's optimizations, could allow for insanely fast propagation of newly solved blocks.</p>
