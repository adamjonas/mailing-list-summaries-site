    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Wladimir, it was brought up that the payment protocol has major gaps that need to be addressed. One issue is that the protocol doesn't cover situations where users are provided or request an address, and incoming payments arrive over a period of time. Wladimir suggests that instead of returning an address, these services could return a payment message. However, there is currently no way for wallets to store a payment message and pay to it later, which needs to be addressed for recurring payments. Bitcoin addresses were not designed with extensibility in mind, and previous attempts to add functionality have been hindered by the fact that they must be handled manually by users. This means that addresses need to be as short as possible, which conflicts with the goal of adding more features.</p>
