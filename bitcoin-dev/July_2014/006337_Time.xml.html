    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The blockchain provides an extra piece of reliable data that is not being exploited by applications, according to Ron OHara in a message posted on a Bitcoin-development mailing list in July 2014. The data in question is time, which the blockchain uses as an approximate time source and gives a worldwide consensus without direct trust of any player. OHara suggests that building time capsule applications that cannot be tricked into exposing their contents too early by running them in a virtual environment with the wrong system time would be possible using the blockchain as an approximate time source. With the upcoming release of breadwallet, the height of the blockchain will be used to enforce timed pin code lockouts that prevent attackers from making multiple pin guesses quickly and changing the device's system time to bypass the lockout period. Aaron Voisine of breadwallet.com made the announcement.</p>
