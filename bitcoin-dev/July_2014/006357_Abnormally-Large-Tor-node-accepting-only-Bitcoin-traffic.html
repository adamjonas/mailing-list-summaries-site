    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In July 2014, Gregory Maxwell reported in an email that he was unable to find any nodes connected to a particular subnet. He speculated that it might be a "snipe hunt." Upon further investigation, he discovered that his IPv4 nodes had iptables blocking of that subnet, potentially due to other misconduct. Other individuals also observed the subnet, which appeared to be a surveillance node listening without sending transactions. This was not the first time this had happened, but the fact that it was a weird tor non-exit-flagged-exit added intrigue.</p>
