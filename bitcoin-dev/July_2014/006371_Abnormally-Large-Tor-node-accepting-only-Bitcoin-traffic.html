    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion thread from 2014, Robert McKay expressed his doubts about using the term Sybil attack to describe Bitcoin protocol's behavior. He argued that the protocol is "identityless," with only one IP address and no clear identities. McKay suggested that "number of sockets" would be a more appropriate measure of the protocol's activity. Additionally, McKay questioned whether this behavior could even be considered abuse, as it follows the rules and may even improve transaction and block propagation. However, he noted that the protocol did not appear to be relaying transactions or blocks as far as anyone could tell. Despite these concerns, McKay indicated that running spy nodes was nothing new and probably not worth worrying about.</p>
