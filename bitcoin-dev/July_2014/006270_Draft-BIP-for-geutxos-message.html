    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jeff Garzik expressed his concern about the lack of helpful advice in the BIP on querying multiple nodes and combining their answers as a partial solution. He suggested that such an approach should only be used if a trusted solution is not available. However, there was no discussion on this choice in the BIP. Jeff proposed that there should be a warning label for this approach, and the weaknesses should be documented in the security considerations section. The IETF documents require a security considerations section, which is absent in the BIP. Therefore, it is suggested that weaknesses should be documented as set out from the rest of the document. For instance, BIP32 enumerates the one-private-key-breaks the chain. The getutxos document is doing well in this regard. It is proposed that some things should be broken out of the auth section into a security/security-limitations section. Moreover, the document should call out specifically that a local network attacker can MITM all the peers. Jeff offered to send a diff with proposed changes if Mike preferred.</p>
