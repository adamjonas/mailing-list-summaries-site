    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on bitcoin-development, Wladimir proposed some basic rules to reduce the level of trust in DNS seeds for Bitcoin Core software. The document laid out some basic expectations for DNSSeed operators and called for replies from those who run one of the DNS seeds to confirm agreement or suggest changes before August 4th, 2014. The expectations included that DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes and not single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an urgent technical necessity and disclosed. Any behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in some situations but should be discussed in public in advance. The proposal also called for an "Expectations for DNSSeed users" outlining what security properties the seeds had and what kind of attacks were possible. For the testnet DNS seeds, the same rules applied as for the main network.</p>
