    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, concerns were raised about the accuracy of a test vector for a password-protected private key implementation. The third test vector includes a "pile of poo" character that may not be a realistic passphrase choice for most users. The NFC form of the passphrase in the test result is also called into question. While the character is accessible on iPhone and Android keyboards, the NULL character is not present, which is seen as a good thing since it could cause problems with null-terminated strings. It is proposed to remove the test vector or use a more realistic test string, such as "ZÃ¼rich" or something written in Thai.</p>
