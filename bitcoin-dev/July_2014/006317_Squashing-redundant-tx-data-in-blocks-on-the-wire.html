    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about minimizing data transfer in the context of blockchain mining. The round complexity is considered more important as a single round trip time (RTT) is enough to send the whole block on many relevant paths. A proposal to use forward error correction (FEC) for low data transfer and negligible probability of needing a round-trip, with a tradeoff for more overhead for lower roundtrip probability, was suggested. However, FEC schemes are complex and add additional metadata overhead. Set reconciliation is considered near optimal. Yaron's non-interactive scheme is praised for its ability to immediately figure out the delta without further back and forth communication, each requiring an RTT. While there is no horse in this race, multithreading the client is considered the best way to go.</p>
