        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion about the weaknesses of dnsseeds, various proposals were made to improve the security and efficiency of these systems. Wladimir J. van der Laan proposed basic rules for DNS seed operation that would reduce the level of trust in these services for Bitcoin Core software. He called for replies from those who run one of the DNS seeds to confirm agreement or suggest changes before August 4th, 2014.Peter Todd recommended developing an "Expectations for DNSSeed users" document that would outline the security properties of seeds and possible attacks. This document would help to improve the overall security of these systems and provide guidance for operators. Additionally, he suggested that seeds offering authenticated and encrypted connections would be more beneficial to users, particularly when using authed/encrypted connections to nodes such as Tor hidden services. For hosts that can reach hidden services, Todd proposed having a separate onionseed process that would be inherently authenticated and somewhat more anonymous. Regarding the DNSseed results, Todd advised being deliberately vague to avoid foreclosing reasonable activities like omitting slow or outdated nodes. However, he suggested that if the purpose of connecting users to functioning nodes is clear, it's probably okay. Operators are encouraged to publicly document their operating practices, but it is not mandatory. Any behavior outside these expectations should be discussed in public in advance. If these expectations cannot be satisfied, the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team, as well as posting on bitcoin-development. Further research projects into node distribution have been suggested, particularly regarding the collection and analysis of DNS query origins while anonymizing and aggregating them to prevent the identification of a single user.While there have been suggestions to use testnet seeds for testing vulnerabilities, the public discussion clause should suffice to allow those exceptions. Overall, the proposals put forth aim to increase the security and reliability of DNS seeds and reduce the level of trust required in these systems for Bitcoin Core software.</p>
