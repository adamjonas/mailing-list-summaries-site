    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a historical note, Jeff Garzik wrote about Satoshi's dislike for the early emergence of GPU mining pools. However, it is worth noting that Satoshi left the project before mining pools gained traction. This information was shared in an email conversation on July 17th, 2014. It is unclear why Satoshi disliked GPU mining pools or how this sentiment may have influenced their decision to leave the project. The conversation also included Slush, although it is unclear what their role was in the discussion. Overall, the email provides a brief insight into the early days of cryptocurrency mining and the attitudes towards emerging technologies within the community.</p>
