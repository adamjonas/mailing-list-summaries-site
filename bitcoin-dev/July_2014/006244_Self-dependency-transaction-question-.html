    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Mike from Plan99.net explains the concept of transactions in the blockchain. He mentions that all transactions in the blockchain exist on a single timeline, which is quantized into blocks. However, duplicated transactions can occur, and while Satoshi assumed that this could not happen due to everything being hash-based, it did happen at one point. To handle this, a rule change was implemented and there is now a BIP covering this new rule. Mike mentions that he chose to not add duplicate transactions to the UTXO when they first appeared, as they were not spent at that time. When the duplicates appear, they are added successfully to the UTXO because the earlier conflicting versions are not present. This allows for assuming that all transaction hashes are unique and enforcing that rule over the entire blockchain.</p>
