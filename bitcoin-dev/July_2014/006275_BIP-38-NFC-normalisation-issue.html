    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the implementation of Bitcoinj code for BIP38, a bitcoin improvement proposal. Andreas Schildbach made changes to his implementation of string filtering so that it could handle SMP chars. Aaron Voisine has tested Andreas' implementation and found that it behaves exactly like in his modified testcase. Andreas suggests that they still need to filter control chars and will look into it again. He also provides a fix for bitcoinj and proposes a new test vector. The passphrase contains GREEK UPSILON WITH HOOK, COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, NULL, DESERET CAPITAL LETTER LONG I, and PILE OF POO characters. The private key is encoded with this passphrase and produces a BIP38 key. Aaron recommends disallowing any character below U+0020 (space) and invalidating passwords containing control characters. He also offers to submit a PR once they figure out why Andreas's passphrase was different from what he got. Mike Hearn suggests limiting the spec to the subset of unicode that all popular platforms can support because Java uses 16 bit characters internally, which might not support astral planes. Andreas proposes banning/filtering ISO control characters to solve the problem. The conversation ends with a link to Black Duck Code Sight for enterprise code indexing and searching.</p>
