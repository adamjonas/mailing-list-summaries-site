    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-development mailing list, concerns were raised about a Tor node that was accepting inbound Bitcoin connections and intercepting port 8333 traffic. According to the post, the Tor node was not generating traffic from good-intended clients as it did not have the exit flag. Instead, the traffic was coming from clients that had specifically added "ExitNode" to their torrc and only used that Tor instance for Bitcoin. The post suggests that someone built this custom Tor node for themselves only, for plausible deniability. The thread also includes links to websites that list Tor nodes by bandwidth, and details about the IP address related to the Tor node.</p>
