    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 27, 2014, a discussion was held regarding the need for better incoming connection limiting for Bitcoin. One participant, Peter Todd, suggested implementing interactive proof-of-memory, and Gregory Maxwell mentioned that he had a good scheme for this but did not have a writeup available. Another participant asked if anyone had any nodes connected to this scheme, but it seems that no one did. A previous discussion on measures for anti-global-resource-consumption had taken place, but it was not considered a huge issue to justify adding more protocol surface area. In a log from July 28, 2014, at 2:00 AM, there is a record of a version message being received from /Satoshi:0.9.2/. The message included information about the version number, the number of blocks, the IP addresses of both the sender and receiver, and the peer ID. This conversation took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list, which is used for discussing the development of the Bitcoin software. There were also advertisements for Infragistics Professional, which is a tool for building WinForms applications.</p>
