    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A set of basic rules has been established for the DNS seeds in Bitcoin Core software to minimize the level of trust required for DNS seeds, as they pose a small amount of risk to the network. The document outlines seven expectations for DNS seed operators, including following good host security practices, serving only fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes, not logging DNS queries except what is necessary for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin network, and publishing a reachable email contact address for inquiries related to DNS seed operation. Operators are encouraged to publicly document their operating practices but are not required to do so. Any behavior outside these expectations should be discussed in public in advance. If these expectations cannot be satisfied, the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development. Further research projects into node distribution have been suggested, particularly regarding the collection and analysis of DNS query origins while anonymizing and aggregating them to prevent the identification of a single user.</p>
