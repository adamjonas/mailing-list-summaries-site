    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Matt Whitlock and Jorge Timón was regarding the development of a specification document for Satoshi's P2P protocol. While Whitlock had knowledge of how blocks and transactions were structured and verified, he was interested in knowing how they were communicated over the network. Timón provided two resources that could be helpful in this regard. The first resource was a link to the Bitcoin wiki which provides information on the protocol specification. The second resource was a link to a forum thread on bitcointalk.org which offers a good introduction to technical details. Both resources could aid in developing a specification document for the P2P protocol.</p>
