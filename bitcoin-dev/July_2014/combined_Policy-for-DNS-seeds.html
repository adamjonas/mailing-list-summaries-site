        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin Core software has established a set of basic rules for the DNS seeds to minimize the level of trust required for them. These rules aim to add more DNS Seeds run by people who closely follow development and are aware of the issues involved. The expectations for DNSSeed operators include following good host security practices, maintaining control of their serving infrastructure without selling or transferring control of it, and not logging DNS queries except what is necessary for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin network.Furthermore, the DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network. While the results may be randomized, they must not single out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an urgent technical necessity and disclosed. The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute.Operators are encouraged to publicly document the details of their operating practices, although this is not mandatory. Additionally, a reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries related to the DNSseed operation. If these expectations cannot be satisfied, the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development.It is acknowledged that behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in certain situations but should be discussed in advance. To ensure transparency, any deviations from the rules should be publicly discussed before implementation. Furthermore, the proposal also calls for an "Expectations for DNSSeed users" document outlining the security properties and possible attacks associated with the seeds.In conclusion, these basic rules aim to reduce the level of trust required for DNS seeds in Bitcoin Core software. They outline expectations for DNSSeed operators and call for transparency and discussion in case of any deviations.</p>
