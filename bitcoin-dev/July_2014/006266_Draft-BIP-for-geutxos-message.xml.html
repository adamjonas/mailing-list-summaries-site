    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between two people is regarding the implementation pull request and BIP for making it secure. The writer mentions that the writeup and discussion includes the details of how to make it secure in "Upgrade" section of the writeup and "Authentication" section of the BIP. However, these ideas are not implemented yet as it involves a large project that requires a chain fork. A possible solution has been proposed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3977">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3977</a>. In response to another person's comment about the security issue, the writer states that the BIP already discusses this in the authentication section and welcomes suggestions for improvement. The comparison between this and BIP 35 (mempool command) is not apt as miners and full nodes treat "mempool" returned data differently than "getutxos" command that proffers post-verification trusted data. The writer agrees to fix any part of the BIP that may be misleading.</p>
