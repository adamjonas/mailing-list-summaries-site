    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context involves a discussion between two individuals, one of whom believes that the requests Jeff is seeing came from their crawler at 148.251.238.178, which takes a full snapshot of the network of reachable nodes every 3 to 4 minutes. However, anyone could be running it since there is no IP address in the log to confirm the source of the requests. The individual provides a sample log of an actual request from their crawler and explains that they want to be able to diff between the snapshots to get the join and leave nodes periodically. They also mention having a task in their schedule to improve upon this method by skipping a new connection with currently reachable nodes while still being able to perform the diff. Jeff Garzik reports that he has seen abusive behavior on one of his public nodes, where someone is rapidly reconnecting with the same node, taking up public slots without reason. Other seeders are also rapidly reconnecting, though the time window is slightly wider. The version message helpfully tells him his own IP address but not theirs. Jeff Garzik is identified as a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.</p>
