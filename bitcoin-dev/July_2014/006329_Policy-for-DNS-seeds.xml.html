    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Core software has established some basic rules for the DNS seeds. The expectations for DNSSeed operators are that they follow good host security practices and maintain control of their serving infrastructure without selling or transferring control of it. The DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the operator's understanding and capability. The results may be randomized but must not single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an urgent technical necessity and disclosed. The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute. Any logging of DNS queries should only be necessary for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin network and must not be retained longer than necessary or disclosed to any third party. Operators are encouraged to publicly document the details of their operating practices. A reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries related to the DNSseed operation. If these expectations cannot be satisfied, the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development. Behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in some situations but should be discussed in advance.</p>
