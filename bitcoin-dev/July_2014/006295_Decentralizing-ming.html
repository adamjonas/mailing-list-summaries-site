    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread starts with a suggestion to propagate the block without re-propagating all the transactions that everyone already has, which would address the large-blocks-slower-to-relay problem. Additionally, it would create an incentive for miners to mine blocks consisting of publicly broadcast transactions. Democratizing transaction selection takes power away from the miners and gives it back to the network at large. GBT is another piece of that puzzle.Mike Hearn suggests finishing off getblocktemplate support in various tools so that it's possible to pool for payout purposes without giving up control of block creation modulo the coinbase. With the recent sipa performance enhancing goodness, it would hopefully persuade some non-trivial chunk of hashpower to go back to running their nodes and start the process of turning pools merely into payout trackers rather than block selectors.Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist, responds by stating that Satoshi's only comment on GPU mining was to wish for a gentlemen's agreement to postpone it as long as possible to help make sure the distribution of coins was as even as possible. This predated pooled mining.</p>
