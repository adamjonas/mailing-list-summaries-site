    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 27, 2014, a user named mbde at bitwatch.co posted on the Bitcoin development mailing list about a Tor node that was exit-only for port 8333. Gregory Maxwell replied that this node would not be selected to exit 8333 without the exit flag and that someone must have manually configured it. The node's IP address, 5.9.93.101, had been accepting inbound bitcoin connections 2-3 weeks prior, according to the Bitnodes crawler. This fits a pattern of someone running a bitcoin node widely connecting to everyone it can on IPv4 to try to deanonymize people while also running a tor exit and locally intercepting 8333 there. However, Maxwell suspects the tor exit part is not actually working. Some other data from the hosts its connecting out to proves that its lying about what software its running.</p>
