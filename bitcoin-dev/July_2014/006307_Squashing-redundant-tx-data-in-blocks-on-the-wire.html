    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author has made an update to a proposal and added it to their GitHub gist. This update proposes the use of sparseblocks and ultra-fast block validation (UFBV) to improve the new-block process. The proposed process, which is only beneficial when transactions have been received in advance, involves receiving a block, checking whether it contains transactions belonging to conflict-sets, and relaying the block if all checks are passed. The use of sparseblocks and UFBV would simplify and speed up the new-block process. However, it is only useful when transactions are seen in advance. Nonetheless, incentivizing ahead-of-block transaction propagation is still a plus, as miners can save on costs. The author notes that working on a block without ensuring that peers have its transactions first can be very expensive from a miner's perspective.</p>
