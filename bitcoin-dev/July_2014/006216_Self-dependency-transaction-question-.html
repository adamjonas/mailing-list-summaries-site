    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A question was raised by Richard Moore regarding the validity of a situation he found in his Python implementation of bitcoind. Block #546's 4th transaction had its first input use its own block's 3rd transaction as an input. He asked if the 3rd transaction of a block could use the 4th transaction from the same block as an input, or are transactions processed strictly top to bottom. Additionally, he asked what would happen if a transaction was self-referencing, where a transaction X has an input of X and an output Y. Aaron Voisine responded that transactions have to be ordered sequentially within a block and since a transaction is referenced by its hash, it's practically impossible to make a self-referential transaction.</p>
