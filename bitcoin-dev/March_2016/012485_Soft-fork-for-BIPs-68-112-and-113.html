    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Core is set to implement a soft fork that will use consensus-enforced sequence numbers, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations. The BIP 113 logic was released in the 0.11.2 release as a standardness rule, while BIP 68 and BIP 112 have been merged into master. However, testing needs to be completed before the code can be backported to supported releases. The rollout mechanism is still being finalized but will be done in coordination with the community. This announcement confirms readiness and that there are no outstanding concerns. It is worth noting that the BIP 68 and BIP 112 logic will only be enforced when the transaction version is greater than or equal to 2, which will only become standard with the release of the soft fork code.</p>
