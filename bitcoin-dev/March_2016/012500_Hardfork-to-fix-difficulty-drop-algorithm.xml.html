    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, David A. Harding and Luke Dashjr discussed the potential need for a hard fork to the difficulty adjustment algorithm in order to quickly adapt to a significant drop in mining rate. However, Harding believes that the likelihood of such a drop is low due to the majority of hashrate being equipment with state-of-the-art power efficiency. While he thinks it's prudent to have a difficulty step patch ready to go in case of a network stall, he does not believe a pre-programmed ramp and drop is necessary. Additionally, he warns against changes that tolerate difficulty drops as they may make the network more vulnerable to partitioning attacks and other issues.</p>
