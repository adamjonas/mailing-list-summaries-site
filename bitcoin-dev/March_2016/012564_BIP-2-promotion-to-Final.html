    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer expresses an objection to "BIP comments" in BIP2 and suggests that BIPs should be self-contained. The specification recommends posting comments to the Bitcoin Wiki, which the writer thinks is a bad idea as external sources are bound to go stale over time. Instead, comments should be made using the Wiki feature at bitcoin/bips itself. The writer's objection was mentioned in a mailing list by Luke Dashjr who has opened a pull request to move BIP 2 to Final Status. The current requirement for this is that "the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community". Given the vagueness of this criteria, Luke intends to move forward applying BIP 2's more specific criteria to itself. Furthermore, there is a reference implementation in the mentioned PR. Anyone can review the latest draft BIP and provide any objections ASAP. If there are no outstanding objections on 2016 April 9th, Luke will consider the current draft to have reached rough consensus and update its Status to Final by merging the PR.</p>
