        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email dated March 14, 2016, Wladimir J. van der Laan presented a release schedule for version 0.13.0 of Bitcoin. However, there was a mistake in the listing of the release dates, as they were mentioned as May 1 and May 15, 2015 instead of 2016. To track the progress of this project more actively, one can refer to the Bitcoin GitHub page, specifically the issue tracker and milestone section dedicated to version 0.13.0.The proposed release schedule for version 0.13.0 of the software entails various stages, each with its own set of deadlines and objectives. The first deadline is set for May 1st, 2015, which signifies the commencement of the translation process for the new version. During this phase, Transifex will be made available for translations; however, there will be a "soft" translation string freeze, implying that no significant changes to the strings will be allowed until the release. Additionally, translations for the previous version, 0.11, will be finalized and closed.The subsequent deadline is scheduled for May 15th, 2015, marking the feature freeze for version 0.13.0. From this point onwards, only bug fixes will be accepted until the final release. Furthermore, a complete translation string freeze will be implemented, disallowing any further modifications to the source language until the release.On June 6th, 2016, the 0.13 branch will be split off from the master branch, signaling the initiation of the Release Candidate cycle. The first RC for version 0.13.0 will be tagged and released during this phase. Additionally, merging for version 0.14 will commence on the master branch.Finally, the goal is to release the final version of 0.13.0 on July 1st, 2016.</p>
