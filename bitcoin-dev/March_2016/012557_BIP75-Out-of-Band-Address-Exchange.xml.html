    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for BIP75, which provides secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication, has tentatively been assigned number 75. The title has been changed to "Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption" to be more accurate. Optional fields have been added to the BIP70 paymentDetails message which include subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. These fields are not specific to the features being proposed, but James MacWhyte sees BIP75 as a general modernization of BIP70 and believes it is fine to include these extensions in the new BIP. However, there are concerns that other extensions should go to separate BIPs, especially since methods to clarify the fee have nothing to do with secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication.</p>
