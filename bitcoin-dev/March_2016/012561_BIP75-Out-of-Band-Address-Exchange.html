    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on BIP75, Andreas Schildbach suggests that the new BIP70 paymentDetails message should not include optional fields such as subtractable fee, fee per kb and replace by fee. Schildbach feels that these extensions should go to separate BIPs as they are unrelated to secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication. In response, Justin Newton states that he is open to either leaving the fields in or doing a separate BIP. James MacWhyte proposes an absolute amount that the payee is willing to cover should be declared instead of letting the payee define a fee rate. MacWhyte believes that it doesn't make much sense for merchants to accept RBF with zeroconf, so last one might be used more to explicitly refuse RBF transactions. He sees BIP75 as a general modernization of BIP70, so he thinks it should be fine to include these extensions in the new BIP, even though these fields are not specific to the features they are proposing.</p>
