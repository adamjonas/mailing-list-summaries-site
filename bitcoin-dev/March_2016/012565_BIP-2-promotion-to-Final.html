    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>BIP Comments, which are post-completion notes from various external parties, should not be linked to external sources like the Bitcoin Wiki (bitcoin.it) but rather made using the Wiki feature at bitcoin/bips itself. External sources are bound to go stale over time as seen in a number of existing BIPs that have linked to expired content. The forum for comments should have a low barrier of use, and the Bitcoin Wiki requires only a request for editing privileges unlike GitHub wiki that would require reading and agreeing to a lengthy Terms of Service contract.The Bitcoin Wiki has been shown to stand the test of time and is less likely to move than the GitHub repository. The BIP process originated on the Wiki and was only moved to GitHub because stronger moderation was needed. Such moderation is unnecessary for BIP Comments, and it would be an outright nuisance.It is suggested that non-reference implementation lists/links be moved to BIP Comments rather than constantly revising the BIPs with them. This proposal addresses all concerns raised, and BIP 2 can proceed unmodified.</p>
