    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about introducing an extra status called "deployed" to indicate when a hard fork has reached a super-majority and is being used by the economy in practice but not the whole economy. Mustafa Al-Bassam points out that it is naive to think that just because someone can't think of an incentive for an attack, an attacker will never do this. He believes that there are many people who would be willing to spend some time causing trouble even if the attack is free to execute. It takes very little time and effort to prevent a BIP from reaching final status, making it guaranteed that some disgruntled or bored person will attack it, even if it's for the lulz. In conclusion, expecting any hard fork, including an uncontroversial one, to be adapted by every single person in an ecosystem of millions of people is wishful thinking, and the BIP may as well state that hard fork BIPs shall never reach final status.</p>
