    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the proposal to change the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE consensus rule based on the median block size over the last three months, allowing the maximum block size to increase or decrease based on actual network usage. The purpose of this consensus rule change is to allow the capacity of the network to adjust to changes in user demand and scaling related technology advancements while still being protected from denial of service attacks. Using floating point calculations in consensus code is deemed a bad idea, and the standard practice is to use very large integers to fake it. The get median function could just as easily use an array of integers, and even if the block size has to be an integer, the limit would still be the rounded-up integer of the block size. It's suggested that adding a second limiter to the growth rate could help gain acceptance, such as making it so that the size isn't allowed to more than double every year, similar to the 1MB limit on the lower end. The graphs likely understate the growth rate since the 1MB limit inherently restricts things to 1MB.</p>
