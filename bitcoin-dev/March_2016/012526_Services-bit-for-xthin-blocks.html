    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A BIP concerning the use of a particular services bit has been sent to Luke jr for discussion on the mailing list. The BIP should document the extreme thin block protocol, and Bitcoin Unlimited has its own process for documentation and discussion on an uncensored forum. It would be redundant and time-consuming for them to adhere to the "Core" engineer's process. A request has been made for any interested engineer to join their forum with ideas and criticisms. If not, it is up to "Core" as a group to decide whether they would like to preserve interoperability by avoiding the use of bit 1.The BIP proposes using a service bit to communicate whether or not thin block communication messages are supported. Clients will use this functionality to choose peers, so a service bit is the most appropriate location. The preferred signaling mechanism is probably the one in BIP 130, but the standard method for getting numbers has been to write a BIP documenting usage.</p>
