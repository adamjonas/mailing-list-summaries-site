    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new version of BIP has tentatively been assigned number 75 and the title has been changed to "Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption". The team behind the proposal has taken this opportunity to add some optional fields to the paymentDetails message, including subtractable fee (give permission to the sender to use some of the requested amount towards the transaction fee), fee per kb (the minimum fee required to be accepted as zeroconf), and replace by fee (whether or not a transaction with the RBF flag will be accepted with zeroconf). These extensions are seen as a general modernization of BIP70 and are not specific to the proposed features. The team has included these extensions in the new BIP and updated the relevant section on Github. The last field may be used to explicitly refuse RBF transactions and allow the automation of choosing a setting based on who you are transacting with. The team invites everyone to take a look at the relevant section and contact them if anyone has any concerns.</p>
