    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Mustafa Al-Bassam and Luke Dashjr revolves around the adoption of a hard-fork BIP by the entire Bitcoin economy. Mustafa raises concerns about one shop owner being able to veto a hard-fork, but Luke clarifies that it is not the hard-fork they can veto but the progression of the BIP Status field. He also points out that if the shop owner is alone in not adapting the hard-fork, they will soon find themselves no longer selling in exchange for bitcoin payments. Mustafa later expresses concerns about someone potentially trying to be annoying and pointing out one instance of one buyer and seller using the blockchain to buy and sell from each other. Luke suggests that if such a split were to occur, it would seem the previous Bitcoin is alive and working, and that resolving such a split is outside the scope of the BIP process.</p>
