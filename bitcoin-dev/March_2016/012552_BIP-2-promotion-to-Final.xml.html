    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jorge Tim贸n raises concerns about the potential for an attacker to prevent a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) from reaching final status. Mustafa Al-Bassam had proposed a definition for when a hard fork becomes active, but Tim贸n points out that an attacker could easily prevent a BIP from becoming final with little time or effort. While there may not be an obvious incentive for such an attack, Tim贸n argues that some people might do it purely for the enjoyment of causing trouble. He suggests that it is wishful thinking to expect every single person in a system of millions to adopt a hard fork, even if it is uncontroversial. As a result, Tim贸n concludes that any hard fork BIPs are unlikely to reach final status.</p>
