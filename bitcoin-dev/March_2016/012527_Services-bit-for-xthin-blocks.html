    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by G. Andrew Stone via bitcoin-dev for the Bitcoin Unlimited client to use bit 4 as a services bit to indicate that the node is capable of communicating thin blocks. However, Gregory Maxwell suggests a more general proposal that allows customization of user-agent specific service bits in the user-agent string. This way, future development can be relieved from the burden of agreeing on where to put what. If followed, other clients can choose to recognize or follow suit with this proposal. It also allows time and utility to show when such a user-agent-specific service bit should be moved into the protocol section of service bits. The proposal does not change peer selection, and if it did, the preferred signaling mechanism is probably the one in BIP 130. The usage of numbers has been previously documented by writing BIPs. Finally, Stone offers his tech services for free, and he owns Litmocracy and Meme Racing. He's the webmaster for The Voluntaryist, which accepts Bitcoin, and he codes for The Dollar Vigilante.</p>
