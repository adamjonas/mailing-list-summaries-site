    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, developers debated the use of an encrypted channel for secure Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) communication. While some argued that a trusted full node and encrypted channel would provide a secure means of SPV communication, others expressed concerns over the potential mixing of messages sent to everyone with encrypted messages. It was suggested that giving encrypted messages their own port number, similar to http vs https, would be the best way to organise things and prevent the separation of nodes supporting encryption from those that do not. However, the idea was met with reservations as it would require twice the bandwidth of the network. One developer also highlighted the vulnerability of encrypting data that identical copies are sent to other nodes at practically the same time, which could lead to a statistical attack.</p>
