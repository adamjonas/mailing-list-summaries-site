        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Mycelium HD wallet issue of not finding all funds is caused by an edge case in the BIP44 spec. This is due to the fact that when a user creates 16 transactions, only the last one is confirmed, leaving unused addresses on the internal/change chain. BIP44 states that there need not be a lookahead on internal chains since they receive coins from associated external chains. However, this can lead to significant gaps in internal chain address usage. It is recommended to look ahead on both external and internal chains when performing account discovery.Additionally, it is suggested that the recommended look-ahead of 20 may not be enough, so it should be raised to 100 or higher. To mitigate the size of gaps caused by failed transactions, it is also advisable for BIP44 to recommend wallets to fill in gaps of unused chain addresses by looking back from the current tip of the internal chain's index when creating a new change address. Overall, implementing these recommendations can help resolve the issue of Mycelium HD wallet not finding all funds.</p>
