    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Luke Dashjr and an unknown party, the issue of where to host BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) comments was discussed. While BIP2 does not specify where the comments section should be located, Dashjr argues that comments are not part of the BIP itself but post-completion notes from external parties. The conversation then moves towards where the comments should be hosted. Dashjr suggests the Bitcoin Wiki due to its low barrier of use, whereas the other party argues that GitHub is a more sensible place due to its collaborative features.Dashjr counters by stating that the Wiki has been shown to stand the test of time and is less likely to move than the GitHub repository. He also notes that while the BIP process originated on the Wiki, it was only moved to GitHub because stronger moderation was needed. However, he believes that such moderation is unnecessary for BIP comments and would be an outright nuisance.The conversation ends with no clear resolution, although both parties agree that non-reference implementation lists/links could be moved to the BIP comments page instead of constantly revising the BIPs with them.</p>
