    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In response to a proposal made by Bitcoin Unlimited, G. Andrew Stone states that they are happy with their existing process and view the mailing list and BIP process as very Core specific. Luke Dashjr responds by clarifying that the BIP process was actually created by Amir Taaki, who was a libbitcoin developer, and is not affiliated with Core at all. He encourages Bitcoin Unlimited to use the BIP process for cross-implementation standards to benefit from peer review from the wider Bitcoin development community and have a common repository for these standards. Many BIPs are discussed on Reddit in addition to the mailing list, and Luke offers to try to go over and assign BIP numbers to the current BUIPs assuming they meet the basic requirements for such assignment. However, he could not find BUIP 1 at all and requests links to each of the BUIPs.</p>
