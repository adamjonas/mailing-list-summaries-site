    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 1, a new BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) was proposed and tentatively assigned number 75. The proposal is titled "Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption". The proposers suggest adding some optional fields to the BIP70 paymentDetails message as part of a general modernization of BIP70. The new fields are: subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. James MacWhyte via bitcoin-dev argues that it would be good to include these extensions in the new BIP despite not being specific to the features they are proposing. Andreas Schildbach via bitcoin-dev disagrees with this argument and suggests that other extensions should go to separate BIPs, especially since methods to clarify the fee have nothing to do with secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication. Justin W. Newton, founder/CEO of Netki, Inc., also joins the conversation. There is no clear consensus on whether to keep the changes in the original BIP or to create a separate one.</p>
