    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion in the bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests that a services bit is needed to indicate that a node can communicate thin blocks. The proposal is to use bit 4 as bit 3 is already reserved for Segregated Witness. However, before claiming a bit, it is necessary to prove its usefulness and that it will have actual users. The NODE_GETUTXO bit is included in the BIPs, but it is not supported by core and is only one of XT's features. Additionally, one can claim one of the free for all bits 24-31, but this is supposed to be temporary. The relevant information on NODE_GETUTXO and NODE_BLOOM can be found in their respective GitHub links. Finally, providing a link to "thin blocks" would help promote discussion about its merits.</p>
