    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 10, 2016, Mustafa Al-Bassam raised a concern about the adoption of hard-fork BIP by the entire Bitcoin economy. He pointed out that even if a small minority refuses to accept a hard fork, it can veto the entire process. However, another member clarified that the hardfork can still happen, but for it to move to the final state, deployment needs to be universal. If there are users who remain on the old chain, a hardfork BIP shouldn't become final. The discussion highlighted the importance of unanimous agreement in the Bitcoin ecosystem for hard forks to be successful. Uncontroversial hardfork BIPs can make it to the final state once deployed, while controversial ones may never become universally deployed. The Bitcoin community needs to come to a consensus on proposed changes before implementing them to avoid fragmentation and potential issues with the network's integrity.</p>
