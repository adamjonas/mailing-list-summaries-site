    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to the Lightning-dev list, Benjamin Weintraub asked how update_fail_htlcs are handled in the case where a node forwards an HTLC along a channel that does not have the funds to support a payment of that size. BOLT #2 states that until the corresponding HTLC is irrevocably committed in both sides' commitment transactions, nodes must not send an `update_fulfill_htlc`, `update_fail_htlc`, or `update_fail_malformed_htlc`. This raised a question for Weintraub about whether nodes still need to commit to a payment that cannot be supported. It was explained that this scenario is handled earlier than update_fail_htlc. When the recipient sees the update_add_htlc, some sanity checks will fail and it won't commit it to the commitment tx. If the recipient decides to simply close the transport connection, the update_add_htlc message is forgotten, and the channel is back to a usable state. BOLT #2 also specifies that when receiving an `amount_msat` that the sending node cannot afford at the current `feerate_per_kw` (while maintaining its channel reserve and any `to_local_anchor` and `to_remote_anchor` costs), the receiving node should send a `warning` and close the connection, or send an `error` and fail the channel. The context clarifies that there is no need to wait until an invalid transaction is received to send an update_fail_htlc.</p>
