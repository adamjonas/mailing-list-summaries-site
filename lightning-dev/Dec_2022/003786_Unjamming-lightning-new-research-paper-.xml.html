    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Clara Shikhelman and Matt, the topic of upfront payments in lightning UX is discussed. Clara disagrees with the statement that upfront fees are detrimental to the user experience, stating that they are necessary to avoid spam and probing. Matt suggests enabling probing through a non-HTLC message and doing pre-send-probing to avoid paying unnecessary upfront fees. Clara believes that nodes should not be motivated to send a lot of failed payments and should adopt better routing strategies. However, Matt argues that there are at least three different routing goals to maximize - privacy, fees, and success rate. While live payments may lean towards optimizing for success rate, many nodes do background rebalancing and prefer paths that optimize for fees, even if they may fail. Matt believes that choosing to optimize for fees or privacy is important and should not be charged extra.</p>
