    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post is about optimizing eltoo for the 2-party scenario, which means that if it's a two-party channel with just Alice and Bob, then if Alice starts a unilateral close, then she's already had her say, so it's only Bobâ€™s opinion that matters from now on. This simplifies a bunch of things and allows for fast forwards, doubled delays, penalties, and trustless watchtowers. The author provides a rough approach for dealing with all those issues for two-party channels, but notes that for initial eltoo experimentation, it doesn't make sense to try to deal with all or any of those constraints; simple and working is better than complex and theoretical. The post also includes a detailed breakdown of how unilateral closes are handled by each channel participant, including maintaining five transactions: UA.n, UB.n, WA.n, WB.n, and RA.n/RB.n. Finally, the post notes that extending this approach to multiparty channels may be challenging.</p>
