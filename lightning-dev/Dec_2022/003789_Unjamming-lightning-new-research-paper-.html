    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, a proposal was made to enable probing via a non-HTLC message to avoid paying upfront fees on paths that will fail. However, it was countered that this should not be a prerequisite for unconditional fees. The sender pointed out that there are at least three different routing goals to maximize - privacy, fees, and success rate - and that optimizing for fees is an important thing to allow without charging extra for it. They agreed that fees and privacy are important but also pointed out the issue of locking up funds in channels knowing that nodes along the route won't be compensated at all. In the email, it was also mentioned that further parameters would be discussed on Monday regarding reputation schemes.</p>
