    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Antoine discusses the upcoming agenda for a meeting regarding potential solutions for channel jamming in Lightning Networks. The first item on the agenda is which parameters should be considered in reputation-based solutions. Before discussing this, Antoine suggests that they should first determine the security goal they aim to achieve with any potential solution. Different solutions have aimed to increase the opportunity cost for attackers, reduce jamming intensity or inflict an on-chain fee damage cost back to the adversary. Antoine believes that a security goal designed in the term of a monetary strategy could be more acceptable to routing hops node operators. The second item on the agenda is circuit breaker. While reviewing the circuit breaker, Antoine wonders if there might be another "hidden" issue while solving channel jamming, namely congestion control of the HTLC flows. In addition to ensuring that any liquidity unit allocated for a HTLC forward is paid back with routing fees, node operators are also interested in processing more forward demand than liquidity offer. They may do so by deferring and sending backpressure messages to the HTLC sender. The third item on the agenda is the onion relay network and its potential uses. Onion relay network rate-limits have been discussed earlier this year, with a probabilistic backpressure scheme proposed. If the onion relay traffic starts to have economically-weighable traffic, there could be a risk of onion-jamming. To solve this, Antoine suggests leveraging more the channel-network topology for the design of a solution. Antoine believes that it would be valuable to have reliable transcripts and maintain a community repository where they can pin the issues, problems, and ideas discussed. In addition, some Lightning developers raised concerns about the frequency of the meetings, suggesting that biweekly might be too much. Overall, the email exchange discusses potential solutions for channel jamming in Lightning Networks. The agenda for the next meeting includes discussions on reputation-based solutions, circuit breakers, and the onion relay network. Antoine suggests that they first determine the security goal they aim to achieve before discussing parameters for reputation-based solutions. In addition, he raises concerns about congestion control of the HTLC flows and suggests leveraging channel-network topology for designing a solution to onion-jamming.</p>
