    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is proposing an independent, Lightning-funded onion routing relay network that supports all kinds of traffic and security. The project aims to support LND/BTCD/Neutrino initially, with a mechanism for path tracing that allows the deduction of nodes that are not functioning correctly or malicious. Channels running across this overlay network would not be possible to jam and with many nodes a lot of traffic would pass through opaque tunnels, making jamming harder. The payment scheme in it might work as a full solution to adding a cost against attempts to jam channels. The reputation of nodes will be measured by client success ranking nodes by how recent and reliable they are, creating a loose consensus on the network of which nodes are better connected and dependable. The median/zip merging process for evaluating the nodes makes it hard for an adversary to damage the reputation of good nodes without also having to run a lot of nodes and for those nodes to also develop a good reputation.</p>
