        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine has proposed the gradual generalization of Lightning onion messaging as a transport network for Bitcoin-specific traffic. However, he expressed concerns about its use as a fully-fledged anonymity network like Tor or I2P, which could lead to issues with DoS. In response, Loki Verloren shared his thoughts on the topic and announced that he was working on a project to build an independent, Lightning-funded onion routing relay network. The project aims to support LND/BTCD/Neutrino initially, with a mechanism for path tracing and reputation ranking of nodes based on their recent and reliable performance. Channels running across this overlay network would not be possible to jam, and payment schemes might work as a full solution against attempts to jam channels. The reputation of nodes will be measured by client success ranking nodes by how recent and reliable they are, creating a loose consensus on the network of which nodes are better connected and dependable. Using a median/zip merging process for evaluating the nodes makes it hard for an adversary to damage the reputation of good nodes without also having to run a lot of nodes and develop a good reputation. The discussion focused on the potential benefits and challenges of using Lightning onion messaging as a transport network and the need for reliable and secure path-finding mechanisms. The fat errors proposal was suggested as a mechanism to improve the reliability of path-finding, which would be a needed piece for reputational credentials.</p>
