    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this communication, Dave describes an issue related to credential tampering by intermediary nodes that can occur in classic payment paths. If Alice controls a node along the path, she can waste the credentials value provided. The problem generalizes for any routing node that can waste the sender's credentials allocated on downstream hops. The author notes that routing nodes mount jamming attacks against other routing nodes, but they will not deliberately attack a payment that goes through them as it sacrifices potential fees. However, accidents can happen, and a node could fail completely by accident, leading to accidental failure. If any mechanism to protect against channel jamming succeeds, then the remaining instances of apparent channel jamming will be accidental.</p>
