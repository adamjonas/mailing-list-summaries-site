    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Derek Atkins, the Chief Technology Officer at SecureRF Corporation, has emailed Rusty Russell to ask if creating a prototype using AEDSA would be a reasonable project. The goal of the experiment is to determine how well AEDSA would fit in and to gauge its performance. Atkins hopes to complete the project in time to present at the next Scaling Bitcoin workshop. He asks Russell if the changes will only need to be made within lightning or if updates to bitcoind/alphad will also be necessary. Jeremy Rubin had previously suggested adding new types of signature schemes to Bitcoin and running lightning over multi-signature variants to utilize the advantages of multiple signature schemes without the drawbacks. In response to Atkins' inquiry, Russell suggests that the hybrid approach proposed by Rubin is possible, but getting novel crypto into Bitcoin is a large task. Russell notes that signatures of 64k wouldn't make much logistical difference to the Lightning Network, while giant pubkeys might be a logistical issue. However, using the Bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should work there too.
