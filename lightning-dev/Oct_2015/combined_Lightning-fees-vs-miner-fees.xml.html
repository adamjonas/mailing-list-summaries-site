    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The post discusses the optimal block size and transaction fees for Bitcoin miners in relation to the adoption of Bitcoin and Lightning. The revenue maximizing per-transaction fee for miners with Lightning is $2.02, with an optimal block size that scales proportionally to adoption. The log-normal distribution model used may not be precise, and numbers from Visa could be inaccurate or incomplete. Additionally, Visa, Bitcoin, and Lightning are not exact substitutes in terms of executing smart contracts, supporting micropayments, payments on credit or fraud protection for consumers, and payment confirmation times. Increased adoption may have some correlation with transaction sizes, and current fees differ wildly from the above estimates. Lastly, if miners are non-organized, it is difficult to come up with a figure for fees or miner revenue other than maximising revenue for miners or minimising costs for users. In this conversation between Anthony Towns and Rusty Russell, they discuss the optimization of revenue for Bitcoin miners. Towns suggests that miners can increase their revenue by accepting transactions with fees of 90c or more immediately, along with transactions that are at least 50 minutes old at 25c or more. It is suggested that including 17% of 25c txs from the mempool in each block would make miners around $1400 in fees. Miners that accept all 20c fee transactions could end up collecting only $360 in fees, rather than $1650. Russell mentions that if a non-cartel miner comes into the picture with 17% hashpower, they could have a different policy. He also notes that alternative payment methods to publishing on the blockchain (like lightning, altcoins, or fiat payments) can undercut prices and steal market share.Towns then discusses how as bitcoin adoption increases, either fees rise, or the number of transactions per block increases proportionally. He notes that Metcalf's law would be a lower bound, which implies that you're more likely to adopt bitcoin if the people you transact with use bitcoin. If those are independent, you get Metcalf's law. He assumes reality would be somewhere in between. They also discuss how anchor transactions could affect the frequency of transactions.Finally, Towns points out an error in his earlier statement about the micropayments market, correcting it to have a volume of $1e10.</p>
