    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mats Jerratsch has created a new open-source organization on GitHub called lightning-core and has opened a repository solely dedicated to holding the specifications of any lightning node. Jerratsch believes this will ensure that everyone builds compatible software, even if they come together infrequently through IRC or mailing lists. The implementations in different languages for different systems would be better if they end up being one large network at the end of the day. It is generally a good idea to have product specifications and implementations in separate repositories, as it provides a clear view of each implementation's contract. Furthermore, implementing advanced topics is easier to work towards if they are structurally on the same repository. A Github repo is a much better place to share these ideas than mailing lists. Additionally, anyone doing a complete new implementation does not have to search across different implementations and mailing list posts to find answers on how their software should behave to communicate with the network. As the project was just started by Jerratsch, practically everything is still missing. The current implementation on the encryption layer is being written together, but Jerratsch noticed that much of it had to be scrambled together from different sources. Anyone can fork and write up, and the status quo can always be discussed before pushing it to master. While the skeleton is missing a lot, they have to start somewhere.</p>
