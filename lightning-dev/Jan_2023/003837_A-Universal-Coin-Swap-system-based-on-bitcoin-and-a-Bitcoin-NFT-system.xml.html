    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author expresses confusion about the current discussion on ordinals and states their opposition to using them as an NFT system or for storing things in witness. They clarify that NFTs can be real things and proposes a simple NFT system based on the Bitcoin blockchain that is easy to implement, secure, decentralized, and not expensive for users. The proposal stores real proof in OP_RETURN and does not flood the Bitcoin network. It uses a reputation model instead of enforcing everything like Lightning. The author also proposes a Universal Coin Swap system based on Bitcoin that works for all blockchains/tokens. This system is meant to be simple, understandable, and show that Bitcoin can do what Ethereum is doing in a much simpler manner. The proof of deals is stored in OP_RETURN and is decentralized. The author asks for feedback on their proposals and provides links to their CV, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other projects they have worked on.</p>
