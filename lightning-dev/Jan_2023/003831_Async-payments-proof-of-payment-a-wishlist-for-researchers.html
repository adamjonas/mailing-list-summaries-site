    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread, the sender's challenge of receiving an invoice from the receiver when they are offline was discussed. The proposed solution involves a BIP340 signature of the message "Alice has paid me $50 -- signed Bob" with Bob's public signature nonce R. To avoid attacks via Wagner's algorithm, it is suggested to share (R1,R2) pairs and calculate R = H(P,R1,R2,m)*R1+R2. This process requires Bob to pre-generate a set of nonces and share the public part with Larry. To claim a nonce, Alice may have to make a micropayment to Larry. The setup also allows for separate LSPs: one to issue nonces while the recipient is offline and the other to hold onto incoming PTLCs. Previous discussions on this topic can be found in the provided links.</p>
