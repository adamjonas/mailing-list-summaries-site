        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a payment channel network for Bitcoin that aims to make transactions faster and cheaper. One of the key mechanisms used by the network is eltoo, which allows two parties to update their transaction state without having to broadcast it to the entire network. However, extending eltoo to multiparty channels presents challenges such as penalizing being harder and coordinating multi-party state updates potentially more difficult. Proposed solutions include penalties on top of symmetric states and trustless watchtowers. The eltoo protocol introduces a cryptographic puzzle that limits the publication of eltoo states more than once by a counterparty. However, vulnerabilities such as a higher-feerate transaction attack and watchtower collusion still exist. Proposed upgrades include penalties on top of symmetric states to reduce incentives for cheating and trustless watchtowers to prevent collusion.To deal with issues related to double delays, penalties, and trustless watchtowers for two-party channels, the Lightning Network development team has proposed a new approach where each participant maintains five transactions to handle unilateral closes. However, this approach does not address potential issues related to adding fees, paying watchtowers, lack of layered transactions, and extending to other payment channels.Penalizing multiple parties in multiparty channels is also challenging, as fast forwards are difficult and coordinating multiparty state updates requires channels within channels and a to_self_delay for each layer. Coordinating multiparty state updates and conserving the fast-forward effect is difficult, and payments at the multiparty level may only be necessary for privacy or liquidity allocation reasons.The scenario where Alice unilaterally closes a channel has been discussed, and an adaptor signature approach or a CTV-like approach can help achieve this. However, locking funds up is a risk if a fast forward is made to someone who has gone offline. Other issues include watchtower-specific transactions and how they might impact privacy by leaking information about their topology.In summary, the Lightning Network is exploring ways to optimize its eltoo mechanism for two-party channels and extend it to multiparty channels. Proposed solutions involve penalties on top of symmetric states and trustless watchtowers. However, challenges remain such as coordinating multiparty state updates and conserving the fast-forward effect. The Lightning Network development team has proposed a new approach to deal with issues related to double delays, penalties, and trustless watchtowers for two-party channels, but this does not address potential issues related to adding fees, paying watchtowers, lack of layered transactions, and extending to other payment channels.</p>
