    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of this email is inquiring about the state of SegWit activation and its impact on the feasibility of Lightning Network (LN). They have been reading through archives and came across a talk that explains the three levels of LN, one of which they are interested in (level 2). While level 2 is said to be less efficient than level 3, there are concerns about security issues involved in level 2. This contrasts with another article that suggests level 3 would offer a better user experience overall by allowing users to outsource channel monitoring. The writer is seeking clarification on these discrepancies and wondering if outsourcing channel monitoring to a server could address the security concerns of level 2.</p>
