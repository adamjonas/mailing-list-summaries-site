    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Bitcoin Stack Exchange, the issue of outsourcing blockchain monitoring was raised as a possible solution to security problems. However, Anthony Towns responded that outsourcing is not yet viable due to the problem of setting up new channels with strangers on the internet who could coordinate with miners to prevent users from reclaiming their funds. He suggested a solution involving only one party paying into the funding transaction and the other signing a refund transaction. However, this solution is vulnerable to third-party malleability. Another user suggested using OP_CLTV/OP_CSV-style channels instead of Spillman-style ones as a solution to this problem.</p>
