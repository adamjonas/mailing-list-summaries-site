    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation between Bastien and darosior, they discussed the issue of estimating a good enough `min_relay_fee` that works for end-to-end transaction propagation over the network. Although this topic has been discussed during the last two spec meetings, it is still unclear whether they will be able to solve this before package-relay lands in bitcoin. Darosior proposed that fundees should be paying a portion of the commit-tx on-chain fees in some cases, otherwise, they might end up with a web-of-trust network where channels would only exist between peers that trust each other, which is quite limiting. However, in an anchor outputs future, the funder only pays for the "backbone" fees of the channel, and the fees necessary to secure the confirmation of transactions are paid in the second stage by each interested party. This seems to be a reasonable middle-ground. Bastien suggested exploring this as a potential short-term solution, but it might not be worth the effort, and they should focus more on anchors and `min_relay_fee`.</p>
