    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to the Lightning Development mailing list, a proposal was made for a hybrid solution to mitigate spam attacks on the network. The proposal involves bidirectional upfront payments and a hold grace period mechanism. The mechanism involves adding a hold grace period delta field to channel updates, two new fields in the tlv extension of update add htlc, and an outgoing hold grace period field in the onion per-hop payload. When nodes receive an update add htlc, they verify that the hold fees are not unreasonably large and that the hold grace period is not unreasonably small or large. If these conditions are not met, the HTLC is immediately failed instead of relayed. The proposal also includes scenarios for settling HTLCs quickly or after the grace period, as well as the closure of channels between nodes. However, there are concerns about the potential deanonymization of sender/recipient nodes and the complexity of implementing the grace period mechanism. The proposal is currently being reviewed by members of the mailing list.</p>
