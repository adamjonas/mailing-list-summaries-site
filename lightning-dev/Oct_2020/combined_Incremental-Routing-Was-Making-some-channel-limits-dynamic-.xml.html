        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list is discussing the use of upfront payment systems for relay nodes in forwarding HTLCs. One proposal under consideration is "incremental routing," where the route of pending HTLCs doubles as an encrypted bidirectional tunnel, allowing for incremental building of a route until reaching the destination. In this model, part of the fund value is given forward to the next peer on the timelock branch and an upfront payment is required before making an outgoing HTLC based on the incoming one. Upfront payments can only be stolen by the direct peer for a single hop that is being built out next in the incremental routing.Incremental routing offers a more secure way to send payments over the Lightning Network since only the upfront fee of one node needs to be offered instead of the upfront payment of all the nodes along the route. The time risk of money being locked up can also be managed more easily with incremental routing, as users can start with an HTLC with the minimum time and then bump up the time of the first HTLC as they build up the incremental route until they reach the destination.However, there are some drawbacks to incremental routing. It requires more communication rounds and cryptographic operations than traditional routing methods, and intermediate nodes can guess the distance from the source by measuring timing of a previous response to the next message from the payer. It is important to note that incremental routing is still an imaginary concept that has not been peer-reviewed yet, so there may be actual cryptographic or practical problems with the idea. ZmnSCPxj has proposed an alternative to upfront payments in the Lightning Network called "incremental routing" that offers benefits but also poses challenges that need to be addressed.</p>
