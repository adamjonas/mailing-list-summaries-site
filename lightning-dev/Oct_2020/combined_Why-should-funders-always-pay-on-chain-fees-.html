        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is currently discussing potential changes to the way fees for Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) are handled. Currently, the party that broadcasts the HTLC transactions is responsible for paying the fees. However, there are concerns that this approach may not be sufficient and could potentially be abused by fundees in certain scenarios.To address this issue, two proposed models have been suggested. The first model involves deducting the cost of the HTLC from the offerer's main output while keeping the base commit transaction weight paid by the funder. This would simplify the implementation process and ensure that the offerer bears the cost of the HTLC they create.The second, more radical suggestion is to tie the total commit transaction fee to the channel usage. In this model, each node would pay a proportionate fee based on the number of HTLCs they offered. This approach would use the on-chain fee as collateral for channel usage and create an incentive for fundees to take into account on-chain feerates. Additionally, it could establish a feedback loop between on-chain feerates and routing fees, which is considered beneficial in the long run.However, there are concerns about the potential negative side-effects of these proposals. Adding complexity to fee splitting could lead to obscure edge cases that could temporarily or permanently disrupt a channel. This raises questions about whether the benefits of these changes outweigh the added complexity.As a result, the Lightning Network community has decided to set the issue aside for now and revisit it later if necessary. It is important to thoroughly explore and test any proposed changes to ensure that they do not introduce unintended consequences or vulnerabilities.In conclusion, the Lightning Network community is actively discussing potential changes to how fees for HTLCs are handled. While there are different proposals on the table, the decision has been made to defer the issue for further exploration and testing before implementing any changes. Feedback and input from various stakeholders are welcomed to ensure that any modifications made to the fee structure are fair, efficient, and secure.</p>
