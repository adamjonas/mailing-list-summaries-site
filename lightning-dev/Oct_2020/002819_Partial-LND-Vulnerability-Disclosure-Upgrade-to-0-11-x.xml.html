    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network, which is a protocol that allows users to send and receive Bitcoin almost instantly and with very low fees, has announced the discovery of vulnerabilities that affect lnd versions 0.10.x and below. The full details of these vulnerabilities will be disclosed on October 20, 2020. However, due to the circumstances surrounding the discovery, there was a compressed disclosure timeline compared to their usual timeframes. While there is no reason to believe that these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, Lightning Network strongly urges the community to upgrade to lnd 0.11.0 or above as soon as possible. They have also offered assistance for anyone needing help with the upgrade process. Upgrade instructions can be found on their installation docs.In addition, Lightning Network has announced that they will be publishing more details about this issue in the coming weeks, along with a comprehensive bug bounty program.</p>
