    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Bastien is discussing the idea of dynamic policy adjustment for channel parameters. He suggests that some of the parameters are by nature dynamic channel parameters, and he'd like to raise `htlc_minimum_msat` on some big channels to be used only for big-ish payments. He notes that there's no need to stop the channel's operations while updating these parameters, as they can be updated unilaterally. While Bastien is specifically interested in eclair's implementation, he asks if other implementations have specificities that would make this feature particularly hard to implement or undesirable.In response, ZmnSCPxj brings up the idea of upfront payment systems as an alternative to relying on reputation, but notes that it may introduce complications around forwarding and fees. ZmnSCPxj outlines some potential issues with this approach and discusses the risks of centralization around long-lived nodes.</p>
