    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the scenario of delaying refunds in a Lightning Network transaction. They explain that if the final recipient delays settling the HTLC before the grace period ends, it is fair for them to pay the intermediary node C for this. However, if the delaying party is not the final recipient, C cannot immediately propagate the update_fail_htlc upstream since the latest commitment transaction for the CD channel still contains the HTLC. There is also a small window where two valid commitment transactions exist. Thus, C can only safely propagate its own upstream update_fail_htlc once it receives revoke_and_ack from D. The grace period between C and D should be measured from C sending update_add_htlc to C receiving revoke_and_ack from D in case the HTLC fails. This is when D is allowed to consume time, and if it exceeds the grace period, it is penalized. For success case update_fulfill_htlc, C can immediately propagate this back to its upstream since it can now. Thus, in that case, we can stop the timer at the update_fulfill_htlc. The start point of the grace period is C->commitment_signed->D containing the HTLC. ZmnSCPxj explains that the D grace period has two smaller grace periods that D imposes on C using the threat of channel drop to protect against the C-side griefing.</p>
