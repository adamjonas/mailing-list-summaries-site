    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Carla Kirk-Cohen announced that there were some technical issues with the recording of Monday's call, and attendees are being asked to chime in if anything was missed. The details for the next call were shared, including the date, time, link, and agenda. Clara had taken notes as well, but Carla relied on her memory which she stated is a "severely corrupted data store." There was also a suggestion made to create a public Google Calendar or other type of shared calendar. There have been discussions about implementing a reputation system for the Lightning Network, which would provide standard metrics to determine what makes a node good or bad to connect to in a decentralized marketplace. This system is being worked on by some attendees and could be useful in the anti-jamming case where a newly connected node needs a start-state reputation score. The idea of defining what qualifies as good behavior in the Lightning Network could be valuable across the board. The LSP specification group has bi-weekly calls and welcomes additional participants. Vincent brought up an ongoing effort to define a kind of standard for Lightning Network metrics that started over a year ago. The basic idea is to collect data from different kinds of nodes and analyze them before making any decision to define any kind of protocol support via BOLT or BLIPS. Different kinds of nodes, such as mobile versus LSP, may require different kinds of metrics and reputation. Some data is already accessible via public API, such as forwarding payment scoring by channels and node uptime.
