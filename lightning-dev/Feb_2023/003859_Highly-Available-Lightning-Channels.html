    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the topic being discussed is the different types of nodes in the Lightning Network and how to fetch scoring data for them. The three types of nodes mentioned are large nodes that send a lot of payments, client nodes that just connect to an LSP or two, and routing nodes that don't send many payments but do send some. The speaker believes that for large nodes, there is no need to add anything extra beyond improving the network maturing and scoring algorithms. For client nodes, the solution is to download data from the large nodes they are connected to. However, for routing nodes, it's trickier, but the same solution of fetching semi-trusted data here more than suffices. The speaker argues that trusting a third-party for scoring data seems reasonable for most routing nodes. Another speaker argued that relying on large nodes for scoring data would move towards centralization, whereas the ha flag allows small nodes to build up their view of the network independently and efficiently.</p>
