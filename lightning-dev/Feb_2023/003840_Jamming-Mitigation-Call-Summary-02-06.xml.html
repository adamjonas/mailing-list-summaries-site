    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On Monday's call, participants discussed "proof of forwarding" schemes and the challenges surrounding upfront fees and differential rates. They considered a scenario where nodes collaborate to "forward" a payment despite having some proof of forward. The group also discussed upfront fees combined with attributable errors to punish nodes that steal upfront fees rather than forwarding HTLC, due to incentive issues when there are large fee differentials across the route. The discussion included experimentation with circuit breakers in the context of local reputation or HTLC endorsement, as well as automating decision-making for end users. However, the implementation of these solutions was noted to require wider spread adoption and changes to surface TLVs on the interceptor API. The group acknowledged the complexity of jamming mitigation and whether these imperfect solutions are worth pursuing. The next call is scheduled for February 20th at 18:00 UTC on <a href="https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN">https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN</a> with an agenda available at <a href="https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/3">https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/3</a>.</p>
