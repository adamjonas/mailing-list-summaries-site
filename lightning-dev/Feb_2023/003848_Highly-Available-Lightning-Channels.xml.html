    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Matt and Joost regarding Lightning Network (LN) routing, Joost suggests that nodes should rely on measurement rather than signaling to aggressively prefer routes through nodes that reliably route payments. While signaling can make measurement more efficient by allowing nodes to skip a failed channel for a longer period of time, Joost argues that HA signaling is directional and sender preference for HA channels may create issues with deciding at what threshold a signal becomes HA. Furthermore, he disagrees with the direction of thinking that LN should be built out of high reliability nodes as it creates centralization pressure. Matt sees a trade-off between network reliability and barrier of entry, and while he believes LN is currently very reliable and fast with few retries required, Joost questions how he can be sure of this without publicly visible data.</p>
