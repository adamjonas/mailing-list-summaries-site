    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Joost Jager and Matt Corallo, the discussion revolved around whether nodes should aggressively prefer routes through nodes that reliably route payments, with Joost suggesting that measurement should be used instead of signaling. However, Matt argued that making the decision binary would force node operators to establish a credit relationship with their peers and that this could lead to centralization pressure. He suggested that good routing scoring should be written to estimate liquidity instead of having a binary good/bad idea of a node. The conversation also touched on the issue of signaling HA channels and the myriad of issues that come with it. Matt expressed his concern that such signaling could fall into a cargo cult of "set the bit" vs "don't set the bit" and that useful data may not be obtained from it. He also suggested that the lightning network can be made reliable without forcing nodes to establish credit to meet "reliability requirements." Finally, he challenged the notion that lightning today is very reliable and relatively fast, providing publicly visible data to support his argument.</p>
