    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the post discusses the advantages of having a Lightning Network with channels between three nodes, rather than two. The benefits include being able to advertise which node has the lowest balance to help with the balance of channels and overall liquidity, being able to route to 10 different next hops for only three opening transaction fees, and the ability for the channel's lowest balance to be publicly broadcasted as a one-bit boolean value. However, there is a problem with N > 2 participants in an offchain updateable cryptocurrency system because if any participant is offline, then the entire system cannot update. Additionally, you need some confirmed transaction to commit funds in the first place, and everyone still has to wait for that transaction to confirm, thus you cannot sidestep the confirmation-or-trust requirement.</p>
