        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context discusses the use of Lightning Network (LN) as an anti-spam, anti-sybil rate limiting scheme for a peer-to-peer network system. The Indra service is used to transport small payments of hundreds of sats at a time with balance in channels being maintained to keep them available. The LN mesh in this network is expected to be vast, with all nodes having at least three peers with channels to them. There may be "seeds" that clients open zero-conf, one-way channels to for very small balances. The intended setup is that the 3 participants are 1 client, and 2 relays. Relays may be motivated to increase their uptime to as close as 100% as possible, but there is simply no way to have 100% uptime. The use of LN as an anti-spam, anti-sybil rate limiting scheme is relevant for many different kinds of monetized p2p networks. The author also discusses the advantages of having a Lightning Network with channels between three nodes instead of two. This includes better balance and overall liquidity, the ability to route to 10 different next hops for only three opening transaction fees, and publicly broadcasting the channel's lowest balance as a one-bit boolean value. However, there is a problem with N > 2 participants in an offchain updateable cryptocurrency system because if any participant is offline, then the entire system cannot update. Additionally, some confirmed transaction is required to commit funds in the first place, and everyone still has to wait for that transaction to confirm. Furthermore, the discussion aims to explore the use of LN as an anti-spam and anti-sybil rate limiting scheme in a separate peer-to-peer network system. This application could be relevant for various monetized p2p networks where users can anonymously pay other relays to host and deliver content for designated user identities. It also enables this to become a distributed service rather than relying on the trustworthiness of relays. The post also discusses the issue of input being signed by one participant, who can sign a different transaction that spends that input differently and bribe a miner to include it in a mined block. ZmnSCPxj signs this message, which includes a public key and digital signature attachments. Overall, the post provides valuable insights into the use of LN in anti-spam and anti-sybil rate limiting schemes, as well as discussing the advantages and challenges of having channels between three nodes instead of two.</p>
