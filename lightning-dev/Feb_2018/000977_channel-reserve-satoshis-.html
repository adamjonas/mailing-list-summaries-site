    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Cezary is asking about the process of communicating to the other party when sending an open_channel and requesting them to put some of their funds into the channel. He also inquires about the purpose of the "channel_reserve_satoshis" field.When opening a channel, it is necessary to communicate with the other party regarding the distribution of funds. This communication can be achieved by specifying the amount of funds each party is willing to commit to the channel. The "channel_reserve_satoshis" field is not related to communicating with the other party but rather serves as a safety mechanism. It indicates the minimum amount of funds that must remain in the channel at all times. Therefore, when opening a channel, it is important to specify the desired amount of funds to be committed by both parties and ensure that the "channel_reserve_satoshis" field is set appropriately for safety purposes.</p>
