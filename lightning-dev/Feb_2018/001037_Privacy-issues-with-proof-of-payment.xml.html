    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Good morning,ZmnSCPxj has suggested a way to anonymously donate money to a node without leaving proof of the payer's identity. This can be achieved by hiding the payment in fees and removing proof-of-payment selectively. The process involves routing from oneself to the payee node, then back to oneself while paying oneself the minimum HTLC forwarding amount and leaving a hefty fee to the payee node. The payee cannot prove that it received payment from the payer as it was just a payment forwarding. Similarly, the payer cannot prove that it paid the payee as anyone on the route other than the payee could have been the source of the payment. However, this method assumes that the payer does not control the entire route.</p>
