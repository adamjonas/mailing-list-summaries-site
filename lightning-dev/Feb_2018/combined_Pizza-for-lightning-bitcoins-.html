        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network has been demonstrated in a real trade for everyday transactions. Laszlo Hanyecz famously used it to buy two pizzas using Bitcoin's lightning network by paying a Lightning invoice. In this trade, his friend acted as a middleman who accepted the Lightning payment and sub-contracted the delivery to a local shop. Laszlo provided the payment hash pre-image to the delivery driver in order to claim his pizza, ensuring that he would receive them as long as he produced the pre-image as proof of payment. The transaction was made using c-lightning and verified through hashing it again. Laszlo funded a channel on the Lightning Network and his friend was able to verify it before proceeding with the transaction. The basic premise of how Lightning Network works for everyday transactions was demonstrated, and the Lightning Network could be used by restaurants like the pizza shop to accept payments directly with their own lightning node. However, there are no pizza places accepting Lightning Bitcoin payments yet, but this method demonstrates the potential of Lightning Network for everyday transactions.The author of an email describes their experience with c-lightning and Lightning Network payments, noting that while they may not be practical for small transactions like buying pizza, they could be useful for larger transactions or businesses with their own Lightning nodes. They provide a sample payment invoice and explain how to verify the payment by hashing the preimage. The author also includes pictures of their family enjoying the pizza they purchased using the Lightning Network.In conclusion, Lightning Network payments offer a potentially faster and more efficient way of making everyday transactions. While there are some risks and limitations associated with it, demonstrations like these show the potential of this technology for future use.</p>
