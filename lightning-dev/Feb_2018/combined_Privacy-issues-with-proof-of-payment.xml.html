        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj has proposed a method for anonymous donations through Lightning network, where the payment is hidden in fees and proof-of-payment can be removed selectively. This approach assumes that the payer does not control the entire route. The focus of the discussion is on privacy concerns related to proof-of-payment mechanisms that provide cryptographic evidence of transactions. While such evidence could be useful for dispute settlement, sensitive transactions should also be possible without negative consequences. The writer suggests having multiple nodes – one tied to physical ID and one or more virtual identities – to transfer funds between them without outsiders receiving payment information. The discussion also suggests that removing destination awareness can greatly reduce privacy issues. Proof-of-payment is defined as a piece of data allowing the payee to prove payment was made and ownership or services were transferred in exchange. The burden of proof lies with the payer, and the proof must indicate agreement, specific obligation, and identity of the parties involved. While it may not be necessary for the proof itself to mention identity, it is important for the payer to know the identity of the parties to verify agreement.The current invoice protocol meets many of these requirements, including the optional inclusion of the payer's node ID and free-format fields for multiple obligations and payment hashes. However, there are still privacy concerns regarding the need for payers and payees to learn each other's identities and cryptographic proof of consent. Additionally, the issue of distinguishing between multiple identical transactions with the same proof-of-payment remains unsolved. It is suggested that making proof of payment optional or reducing its strength or abandoning it altogether or using bi-directional routing could help address some of these concerns.In conclusion, the discussion highlights the importance of maintaining privacy while also providing a secure and accurate proof-of-payment system in the design of the Lightning network.</p>
