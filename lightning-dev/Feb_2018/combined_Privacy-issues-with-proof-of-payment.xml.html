        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion revolves around the privacy concerns that arise from having a signed invoice that provides cryptographic evidence to the buyer and/or seller that a particular transaction has taken place. The concept of proof-of-payment is defined as a piece of data known to the payee that allows them to prove that payment was made to them and in exchange, they agreed to transfer ownership or provide services. While the current invoice protocol meets most of these requirements, there are still privacy concerns that arise. The writer expresses concern over the privacy implications of signed invoices and proof-of-payment mechanisms on the Lightning network. ZmnSCPxj has suggested a way to anonymously donate money to a node without leaving proof of the payer's identity. This can be achieved by hiding the payment in fees and removing proof-of-payment selectively. However, this method assumes that the payer does not control the entire route. To address the privacy concern, there could be an ability to provide a pre-cooked onion that would allow payment to an anonymous destination directly or via a middleman who has that pre-cooked onion.Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of maintaining privacy while also providing a secure and accurate proof-of-payment system. The writer suggests having multiple nodes - one tied to physical ID and one or more virtual identities - to transfer funds between them without outsiders receiving payment information. The writer asks whether proof of payment should be optional, whether its strength should be reduced, and whether bi-directional routing is useful.</p>
