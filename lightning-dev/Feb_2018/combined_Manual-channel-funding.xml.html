        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On the Lightning network platform, users are currently unable to manually choose outputs to fund their channels. Additionally, there is no option available to fund a channel with "all available funds". A user reported facing a similar issue while setting up a channel and attempting to use all of their available funds which resulted in a transaction on the blockchain with an output for 980 SAT. To address such concerns, the user suggested implementing an option to "take fee from funding amount" and the ability to choose exact outputs to spend.Alex P also expressed concerns about the inability to manually choose outputs to fund channels and the absence of an option to fund channels with all available funds. Upon trying to utilize all available funds, Alex P received a transaction on the blockchain with an output of 980 SAT. In response to this inquiry, Christian suggested that the issue may be related to the interface that the implementations expose and advised filing an issue with the respective implementation. The conversation took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
