        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user on the Lightning-dev mailing list has raised concerns about the inability to manually choose outputs to fund channels and the lack of an option to fund channels with all available funds. The user, named Alex P, attempted to utilize all available funds but received a transaction on the blockchain with an output of only 980 SAT. Christian, who also responded to the inquiry, suggested that this issue may be related to the interface that the implementations expose. Currently, there is no option for users to select the exact outputs they want to use to fund their channels. This has led to suggestions from users like Alex P for the implementation of such an option. Additionally, users have requested the ability to fund channels with all available funds and the option to "take fee from funding amount". It is important for these issues to be addressed in order to improve the overall user experience and functionality of the platform.</p>
