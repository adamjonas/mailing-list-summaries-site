        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Conner Fromknecht, a developer, has made significant improvements to the lightning-onion repository by implementing a more efficient linear algorithm. Previously, all implementations of the project relied on a quadratic algorithm, which Conner replaced with his optimized approach. By reducing the number of scalar multiplications, Conner's algorithm achieved an impressive 8x speedup and utilized approximately 70% less memory.Recognizing the potential impact of these upgrades, Conner has submitted a pull request to update BOLT 4, which currently recommends the use of a quadratic time algorithm. The pull request includes the necessary changes to the recommendation and reference code, along with a detailed description of the modifications. To ensure the correctness of the updated implementation, Conner verified the output against the (updated) BOLT 4 test vector.For those interested in exploring Conner's work further, links to the relevant repositories and pull requests have been provided. This includes the lightning-onion repository where the improvements were made, the pull request containing the proposed updates to BOLT 4, and the BOLT 4 test vector used for verification. Additionally, Conner mentions the possibility of updating the example source in lightning-rfc, indicating a willingness to extend the impact of these optimizations beyond the lightning-onion repository.</p>
