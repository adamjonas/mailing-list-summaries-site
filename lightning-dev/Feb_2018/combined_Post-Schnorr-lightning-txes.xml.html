        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Anthony Towns proposed a new method for managing channel state updates in the Lightning Network. The proposed method involves generating six-plus-eight times the number of HTLCs in-flight transactions every time the channel state is updated. All funding tx outputs can be pay2pubkey(hash), which allows HTLCs to work with pre-signed timelocked transactions and scriptless scripts/discreet-log contracts to reveal the secret. To optimize non-cooperative channel closure in the Lightning Network, the author suggests using graftroot, which involves three transactions. Additionally, the author suggests using Schnorr to handle HTLCs via elliptic curve private keys, which would simplify scripts and make enforcing correct behavior cheaper.The article also mentions that it is not possible to do better than the proposed method without serious changes to bitcoin. The author was hoping covenants and graftroot would be enough, but they are not. The author suggests outsourcing channel monitoring by allowing a penalty tx to be constructed based on the channel commitment tx. A formula can be arranged for constructing a penalty tx based on the channel commitment tx. The channel monitoring service can catch fraudulent transactions, work out the appropriate revocation secret, and finish the signature by catching any fraudulent transactions. Channel monitoring can be outsourced efficiently as little as a signature per state could be made to works as far as the author can see.In conclusion, the author proposes a new method for managing channel state updates in Bitcoin that simplifies the scripts and requires only a constant amount of data to be stored for channel monitoring. The author suggests outsourcing channel monitoring and believes it can be done efficiently. The article points out that there is no plausible way of doing constant space outsourced channel monitoring without some sort of SIGHASH_NOINPUT. The author also notes that the proposed method could make it feasible and interesting to penalize disappearance as well as misbehavior.</p>
