        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal for a new method of managing channel state updates in Bitcoin has been put forward by Anthony Towns. The suggested approach involves generating six-plus-eight times the number of HTLCs in-flight transactions each time the channel state is updated, including Channel State Commitment TX, Channel Fund Distribution TX, Timeout TX, and Success TX. The author suggests optimizing non-cooperative channel closure in the Lightning Network by using graftroot, which involves three transactions, treating outputs as muSig Schnorr pay-to-pubkey addresses, and signing appropriate outputs by each party to avoid misbehavior.Additionally, Schnorr can be used to handle HTLCs via elliptic curve private keys, simplifying scripts and making enforcing correct behavior cheaper. This approach allows users to forget information about old HTLCs while still enforcing correct behavior. The author suggests outsourcing channel monitoring by allowing a penalty tx to be constructed based on the channel commitment tx, catching fraudulent transactions, working out the appropriate revocation secret, and finishing the signature. Channel monitoring can be outsourced efficiently, and the proposed method could make it feasible and interesting to penalize disappearance as well as misbehavior.The article points out that there is no plausible way of doing constant space outsourced channel monitoring without some sort of SIGHASH_NOINPUT. The author also notes that the proposed method could make it possible to drop the muSig-style construction, which is needed to protect against potential malicious choice of the revocation secret. In conclusion, the proposed method for managing channel state updates in Bitcoin involves generating multiple transactions for each update and outsourcing channel monitoring efficiently.</p>
