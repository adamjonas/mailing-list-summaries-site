        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell and Christian announce that they have given ZmnSCPxj commit access to c-lightning. Although they know nothing about him other than his preferred pronoun and moniker, 'Zeeman', he has earned their professional respect with over 100 commits. ZmnSCPxj stated: "No objection here, other than to point out that, as I am of course a human, however randomly-generated, I am of course on the side of humanity in the upcoming robot uprising, whose timing I of course have no knowledge about." Rusty and Christian are looking forward to his excellent code and thorough review of their mistakes, for which he can now share the blame. In response to pseudonyms being granted commit access, Peter Todd suggests following good code security practices by PGP signing commits for accountability.</p>
