    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around proposing a solution for the initial sync issue between nodes in the Lightning Network, specifically between mobile nodes which are often offline and need to resync frequently. Christian suggests adding a simple announcement cutoff timestamp with the intention of designing something more sophisticated given more time. However, Fabrice prefers the approach of having an optional feature bit signaling that a `set_gossip_timestamp` message must be sent immediately after `init`. The proposal involves grouping channel announcements by "buckets" and creating a filter for each bucket, exchange, and use them to filter out channel announcements. A new `use_channel_announcement_filters` optional feature bit (7 for example) and a new `channel_announcement_filters` message would be added. When a node receives an `init` message with the `use_channel_announcement_filters` bit set, it sends back its channel filters. When a node receives a `channel_announcement_filters` message, it uses it to filter channel announcements before sending them. The filters would be sorted by short channel id and grouped by 144 blocks or 1 block, depending on when they were created. The proposed solution aims to optimize the case where nodes are connected to few peers and are online a few times every day.</p>
