    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list has discussed the possibility of making multipath payments. The proposal suggests using two hashes to claim the HTLC, which would give the sender a receipt after only one of the HTLCs is claimed. However, there are concerns that this would result in the loss of proof of payment. It was pointed out that the proposal defines a way to make multipath donations, not multipath payments. Additionally, it was suggested that the increased reliability and privacy arguments for multipath payments are overwhelmingly compelling. One potential downside mentioned is the difficulty of maintaining atomicity and decorrelation without introducing new primitives. Another concern is that if there is a second hash, it would presumably be the same for all routes, making them linkable again. Despite these issues, the community seems enthusiastic about the possibility of multipath payments and is continuing to explore ways to implement them.</p>
