    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Robert Olsson and ZmnSCPxj discusses the possibility of balancing channels in the Lightning Network. ZmnSCPxj notes that while it is possible, no implementation currently exists. Additionally, "balance" is not necessarily a desirable property for channels, as illustrated by an example where Bob can pay a 1.5BTC invoice in an unbalanced scenario but cannot in a balanced scenario. However, once AMP is possible, this consideration will no longer be an issue. The email includes a hypothetical scenario in which Bob pays himself an invoice of 1BTC to balance his channels. Robert wonders if this functionality could be implemented in the CLI or made automatic, but expresses concern about the risk of oscillation if everyone starts doing it.</p>
