    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On February 23, 2018, Rusty Russell announced that he and Christian have given ZmnSCPxj commit access to c-lightning. ZmnSCPxj has earned their professional respect with over 100 commits, many of which were non-trivial. Although they don't know much about ZmnSCPxj, they are confident in his ability to provide excellent code and thorough review of their mistakes. In response to this announcement, Peter Todd suggested that pseudonyms should use PGP signing commits for accountability and that good code security practices should be followed.</p>
