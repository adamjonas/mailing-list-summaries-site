    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this message proposes a new mechanism for timestamp synchronization and suggests that this should be a feature bit pair. They propose that the `timestamp_routing_sync` feature should override the `initial_routing_sync` feature, and similarly, a future `fancy_sync` would override `timestamp_routing_sync`. They also suggest that an optional 4-byte `routing_sync_timestamp` field can be appended to `init` without issues. The author expresses their dislike for the re-transmission of all old channel_announcement and node_announcement messages, just because there's been a recent channel_update. Instead, they suggest that it would be simpler to say 'send anything > = routing_sync_timestamp'. The author explains how c-lightning internally keeps a tree of gossip in the order they received them, keeping a 'current' pointer for each peer. However, this isn't quite the same as timestamp order, so we can't just set the 'current' pointer based on the first entry >= routing_sync_timestamp. We need to actively filter, which is still a simple traverse, however, skipping over any entry less than routing_sync_timestamp.The author raises some questions about the proposed mechanism, such as when to stop retransmitting announcements if a new channel_update comes in during this time, and whether they have to remember which ones they've sent to each peer. They suggest that if missing announcements become a problem, a simple query message could be added, which they think will be needed for any fancy scheme anyway.</p>
