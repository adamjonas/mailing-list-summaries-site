    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation about open_channel, it was asked how to communicate to the other party to put funds into the channel. However, it was stated that there is currently no way to do so as of BOLT v1.0 due to various issues such as trust and the risk of being locked out of funds by the other party. The use of dual-funded channels require some level of trust between both parties and can be mitigated by disallowing dual-funding by default on the node. The field "channel_reserve_satoshis" was also discussed and it was clarified that it is not related to communicating the desire for the counterparty to commit funds to the channel. Rather, it is an amount that each party should keep on the channel once the channel state has moved from "all of the funds is assigned to the opener of the channel." This field helps to prevent costless theft and ensures that stealing attempts have a cost.</p>
