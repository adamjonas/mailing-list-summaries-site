        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchange between Cezary and ZmnSCPxj discusses various aspects of the Lightning Network (LN) and its functionality. They talked about the risks involved in opening channels to few nodes, compared to opening channels to more nodes. The current code in c-lightning tends to couple "channel" to "peer" too much, making it difficult to open multiple channels with a single participant. LND can form multiple channels with peer LND, but currently, c-lightning daemon will reject the multiple channel attempt from LND. In terms of receiving LN payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel, options include doing the Blockstream Store route, publishing node and contact details, waiting for services to offer deals like "up to 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!", or asking a friend to channel to you.Regarding opening channels and requesting the other party to put funds into the channel, there is no way to do so as of BOLT v1.0 due to various issues such as trust and the risk of being locked out of funds by the other party. However, dual-funded channels require some level of trust between both parties and can be mitigated by disallowing dual-funding by default on the node.The "channel_reserve_satoshis" field was also discussed, and it was clarified that it is not related to communicating the desire for the counterparty to commit funds to the channel. Rather, it is an amount that each party should keep on the channel once the channel state has moved from "all of the funds is assigned to the opener of the channel." This field helps to prevent costless theft and ensures that stealing attempts have a cost.ZmnSCPxj suggested not trusting a single hub and instead encouraging more hubs by having incoming 300mBTC from one hub and making an outgoing 300mBTC to another hub. Another option is to make "circular superhubs" where small groups cooperate and each member opens channels with the other two members. This allows for seamless sending and receiving to anyone on the network.Lastly, Cezary wonders why both sides cannot fund channels. ZmnSCPxj explained that it's because of trust issues and technical limitations, but there is already an issue regarding this and it may be added to BOLT in the future.</p>
