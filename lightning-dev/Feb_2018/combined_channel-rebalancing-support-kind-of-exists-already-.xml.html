        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning protocol offers channel re-balancing, a feature that allows users to pay themselves an invoice of 1BTC and ensure the route goes out through one peer and comes back via another, resulting in two balanced channels. However, balance may not be necessary for all channels as it could impact the user's ability to pay certain invoices. The Lightning network provides better possibilities for channel re-balancing through source routing, where the source can explicitly specify the entire route.On the Lightning-dev mailing list, users discussed a hypothetical scenario where Bob wants to balance his channels with Alice and Carol by paying himself an invoice of 1BTC via them. Some users argue that rebalancing may not be necessary as they may have separate channels for receiving funds and spending, which can be refunded through other channels.The email thread also discusses the need for a function that can refuse routing over a channel if it would result in less than X% of capacity, and to automatically balance a channel to have at least X% of capacity. This is highlighted by the scenario where an employee opens a new channel directly to Walmart, but the employer also buys from Walmart using the same channel and uses up most of the capacity. When the employee tries to use the channel, they realize that it is already used up and needs to be routed back through the employer's node, which is currently undergoing maintenance.The discussion concludes with a suggestion for a feature in the CLI allowing users to pay themselves an invoice of 1BTC and specify which two channels they would like to balance. Potential use cases for channel re-balancing include reducing risk of saturated channels and protecting privacy.</p>
