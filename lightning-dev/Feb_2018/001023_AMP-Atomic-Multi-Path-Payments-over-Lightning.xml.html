    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list has raised the question of whether atomicity should be abandoned in favour of making proof-of-payment presentable in court. The debate centred around whether to make payments non-atomic, thereby allowing merchants to trust recipients to claim only the owed amount, or whether to adopt a new system that is able to present proof-of-payment in court without abandoning existing guarantees. Corn√© Plooy suggested that a new signed invoice could be formulated stating several payment hashes, their corresponding amounts and the obligation of signer to deliver Z if all corresponding payment keys are shown, with terms to handle the case where only part of the payments was successful. In addition, the payer would sign a declaration stating which transactions were cancelled and which ones should be refunded.</p>
