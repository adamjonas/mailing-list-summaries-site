    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Cezary and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed various options for receiving Lightning Network (LN) payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel. They mentioned that the first two options are for those who want to earn some money for payment fees, while the third option is more suitable for new businesses like coffee shops. However, it was noted that if such a new business would like to have a channel with 300mBTC on both sides, it can be quite hard to establish a balanced channel as it requires trust in the hub. To solve this issue, ZmnSCPxj suggested not trusting a single hub and instead having incoming 300mBTC from one hub and making an outgoing 300mBTC to another hub. This encourages more hubs and makes the node a potential routing node, improving network connectivity.Regarding the inability to fund channels from both sides, it was noted that there is already an issue regarding this but that the priority is the actual implementation of payments. Dual-funding channels can be emulated by having some hubbing service make channels to you, while you make a channel to some other hub. Another suggestion was to make "circular superhubs" if small groups of people cooperate, allowing them to send and receive reasonably seamlessly to anyone on the network. In conclusion, there are various ways to receive LN payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel, including early adoption, publishing node and contact details, deals from services, and asking friends to channel to you. Additionally, solutions like having incoming and outgoing channels with different hubs or creating circular superhubs through cooperation were also mentioned as alternatives.</p>
