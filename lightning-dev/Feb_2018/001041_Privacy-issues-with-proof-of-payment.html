    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about proof-of-payment, it is suggested that removing destination awareness can greatly reduce privacy issues. Proof-of-payment is defined as a piece of data allowing the payee to prove payment was made and ownership or services were transferred in exchange. The burden of proof lies with the payer, and the proof must indicate agreement, specific obligation, and identity of the parties involved. While it may not be necessary for the proof itself to mention identity, it is important for the payer to know the identity of the parties to verify agreement. The current invoice protocol meets many of these requirements, including the optional inclusion of the payer's node ID and free-format fields for multiple obligations and payment hashes. However, there are still privacy concerns regarding the need for payers and payees to learn each other's identities and cryptographic proof of consent. Additionally, the issue of distinguishing between multiple identical transactions with the same proof-of-payment remains unsolved.</p>
