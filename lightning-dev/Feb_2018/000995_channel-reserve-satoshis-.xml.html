    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, a user named Cezary asked ZmnSCPxj about the possibility of opening multiple channels between parties in c-lightning. While it is possible to open multiple channels in LND, this feature is not currently available in c-lightning. According to ZmnSCPxj, the reason for this is trust issues, but there is already an issue regarding this and it may be added to BOLT in the future. ZmnSCPxj suggested that an alternative to dual-funding channels would be to have incoming funds from one hub and make an outgoing payment to another hub. This not only encourages more hubs, but also allows for the potential to become an alternate route if other routes become congested. Additionally, creating "circular superhubs" with small groups of users can improve network connectivity and allow for seamless payments. Other options for receiving LN payments include the Blockstream Store route, publishing node and contact details, asking a friend to channel to you, or waiting for services to offer deals for new businesses. However, the third option may be the best for new businesses as it offers a deal for up to 300 mBTC receive for only 1mBTC with at least 3 months channel alive.</p>
