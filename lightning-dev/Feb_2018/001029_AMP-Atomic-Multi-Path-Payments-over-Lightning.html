    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Conner Fromknecht suggests that the current signed invoice and preimage is a weak proof of payment as it does not bind a specific sender, making statement 1 producible by multiple individuals. Any intermediary who acquires an invoice with the appropriate hash could also make this claim since they also have the preimage. He thinks exploring proofs of stronger statements would be incredibly valuable. Rusty agrees with him and says that proof-of-payment is a unique lightning property and our actions so far have been to bolster this, and he would hate to see us discard it for convenience.</p>
