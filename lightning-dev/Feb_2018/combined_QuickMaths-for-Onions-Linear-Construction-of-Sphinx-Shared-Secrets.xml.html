        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Conner Fromknecht, a developer, has upgraded the lightning-onion repository by developing a linear algorithm that reduces scalar multiplications. The new optimization results in an 8x speedup and uses ~70% less memory. Previously, the implementation used a quadratic algorithm to apply intermediate blinding factors. This change was pointed out by roasbeef. Conner's PR includes a description of the update along with the modified source code. The updated output has been verified against the BOLT 4 test vector. Conner has also submitted a pull request to update the example source in lightning-rfc. In his findings, he discovered that all implementations of the lightning-onion repository used a quadratic algorithm, which he replaced with a more efficient linear algorithm. The recommendation and reference code in BOLT 4 suggests the use of a quadratic time algorithm, but Conner's tests have shown that his new linear algorithm is much more efficient. Links to the lightning-onion repository, the PR, and the BOLT 4 test vector are provided in the context.</p>
