        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Conner Fromknecht, a developer, has upgraded the lightning-onion repository by developing a more efficient linear algorithm that reduces the total number of scalar multiplications. He found that all implementations of the project used a quadratic algorithm and worked to replace it with his optimized version. The result was an 8x speedup and ~70% less memory usage. Conner has submitted a pull request to update the recommendation and reference code in BOLT 4, which previously suggested using a quadratic time algorithm. The correctness of the output has been verified against the updated BOLT 4 test vector. Links to the relevant repositories and PRs are included in the message.The modified source code is described along with Conner's pull request to the lightning-onion repository. Additionally, if there is interest, he can update the example source in lightning-rfc. All relevant links to the lightning-onion repository, the PR, and the BOLT 4 test vector are provided in the context.</p>
