    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about splitting payments into smaller transactions, the question of use cases arises. In situations where there is already a level of trust between payer and payee, such as when physical goods are being exchanged, partial payments can be made and any issues can be cooperatively resolved. However, in cases where there is less trust, a signed invoice can be used to provide proof of agreement between the two parties. For example, a merchant may offer to deliver goods if the user pays a certain amount with a specific payment hash. Once the payment is made and the payment key matching the hash is obtained, the merchant may refuse to deliver. In such cases, the user can present the signed invoice and proof-of-payment in court to force the merchant to honor their commitment.</p>
