    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj, a member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, suggested using techniques like ZKCP and ZKCSP to provide atomic access to information in exchange for monetary compensation. This can be done by encrypting the information, providing a hash of the encryption key, and proofs that the encrypted data is the one desired and was encrypted with the given key. Possession of the encryption key would be sufficient to gain access to the information without legal structures. However, ZKCP and ZKCSP depend on new cryptography.Christian Decker questioned the need for complicating the system when they already have a system that allows atomic multipath payments using a single secret. Future decorrelation mechanisms will allow variation of the secret so that multiple paths cannot be collated. He also raised concerns about overpaying and trusting the recipient to claim only the owed amount. Instead, he proposes deriving secrets from the main secret and making the derivation reproducible by intermediate hops to pay the exact amount. Corn√© Plooy proposed a different signed invoice format for use cases where there is already trust between payer and payee. In this format, the original invoice states several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts, along with the obligation of the signer to deliver Z if all corresponding payment keys are shown. If a payment partially fails, it can be refunded cooperatively with an invoice created by the payer. The court is the final point of settlement for invoices in this use case. ZmnSCPxj noted that AMP currently cannot provide proof-of-payment, unlike current payment routing that has proof-of-payment. However, it is an eventual design goal that would enable use of ZKC(S)P on-Lightning, assuming zk-SNARKs and so on are something that can be trusted.</p>
