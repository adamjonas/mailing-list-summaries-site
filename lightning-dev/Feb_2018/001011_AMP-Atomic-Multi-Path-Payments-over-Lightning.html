    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on Lightning payments continues with the aim of solving issues related to proof-of-payment. One idea is to use two hashes to claim the HTLCs, which would provide a receipt after only one of the HTLCs was claimed. However, there are concerns about linkability and incentive for the receiver to claim the HTLCs before being fully paid. In addition, there is discussion around the feasibility of making multipath payments while retaining proof of payment. The potential benefits of multipath payments include increased reliability and privacy, as well as potential fee savings for larger payments. While the discussions continue, changes to the scripts may be necessary to implement these solutions.</p>
