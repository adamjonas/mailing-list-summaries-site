    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has announced an alpha release of an OpenGL Lighting Network visualizer written in C+ nanovg with no dependencies except for glfw. The visualizer parses c-lightning channels and node json, but the developer is currently adding support for LND. The visualizer renders the Lightning Network channel gossip including nodes and edges between those nodes. Channels are colored by the node that opened the channel, and channel widths are rendered proportional to the capacity. Right-clicking a node filters the view to that node and its neighbors, and dragging a node in any view will focus that node and its neighbors. The next things that the developer thinks would be fun to have include filter by alias/id in the UI, "Google Maps" mode for highlighting potential routes between nodes, and realtime channel updates from network gossip. Contributions from other developers are welcome.</p>
