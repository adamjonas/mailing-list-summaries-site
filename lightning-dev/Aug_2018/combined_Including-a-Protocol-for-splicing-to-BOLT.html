        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developers are discussing the implementation of two new features - "splice-in" and "splice-out". These features will enable routing across channels during a few blocks. However, the process of splicing requires low-level knowledge of Bitcoin, the protocol, and specific implementation details. To minimize the complexity of the implementation, Laolu Osuntokun suggests limiting splice-in.In addition to splicing, the developers are also discussing the possibility of implementing spontaneous payments that could allow for donations without requiring proof of payment. This feature would require payers to generate the preimage and hash and include the preimage in the Sphinx message to the payee node.Moreover, the Lightning Network developers are discussing the importance of retaining Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) while implementing Additional Multi-Part Payments (AMP). While AMP can reduce the importance of maximum channel capacity, some argue that retaining ZKCP is more important than implementing AMP or double-funding and splicing. However, others suggest that an AMP that retains proper ZKCP is necessary to facilitate trustless on-to-offchain and off-to-onchain bridges.Corné Plooy highlights the increasing demand for the spontaneous payments feature from users and developers. Christian Decker agrees on the importance of splicing as a key piece in improving user experience, and Rusty Russell argues that both splicing and multi-path routing are necessary. In response to this discussion, Rene Pickhardt offers to take the initiative on creating a Splicing protocol for BOLT 1.1. While Lightning Labs have started working on splicing, the protocols need formalization. Finally, the communication emphasizes the importance of off/onchain bridges, which can provide incoming channels, reloading spent channels, and unloading full channels through BOLT11 invoices, providing the necessary ZKCP to make the bridge trustless.</p>
