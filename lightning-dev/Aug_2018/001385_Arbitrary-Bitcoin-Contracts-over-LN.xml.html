    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Lightning-dev community has raised questions about the use of LN-penalty in Bitcoin SCRIPTs. The concern is that CLTV-branches and nLocktimed spending transactions need to be guarded with an additional `OP_CSV` condition since they may leak on-chain and become immediately valid. To address this issue, a two-stage HTLC resolution was introduced, with the first stage acting as the `OP_CSV` guard and keeping the second stage clean. The CSV belongs in the output script, not the input script, and if C contains a CLTV-branch whose timeout expires before attempting on-chain mediation, then both branches become valid, resulting in a race. The Poon-Dryja method is considered superior for transportation of *arbitrary* contracts compared to Decker-Wattenhofer or Decker-Osuntokun-Russell. The only smart contract one really wants to transport is HTLC or equivalent in scriptless script. Any Bitcoin SCRIPT may be expressed as a Boolean computation whether or not the contract has been fulfilled by the transaction that attempts to claim it. Under Poon-Dryja, the transaction series involves the creation of symmetrical transactions from [/*arbitrary*/, A && B] -> [signA signB, (revoke) || (A && B && C)] -> [signA signB witnessCbyA, revoke || (A && CSV)] /* held by A */ and [/*arbitrary*/, A && B] -> [signA signB, (revoke) || (A && B && C)] -> [signA signB witnessCbyB, revoke || (B && CSV)] /* held by B */.  Under Decker-Osuntokun-Russell eltoo, the transaction series is [/*arbitrary*/, A && B] -> [signA signB, (CSV && A && B) || (CLTV && A && B)] -> [nSequence signA signB, C]. The CSV in the second transaction is potentially interfering with the contract C if C is time-sensitive. In contrast, Poon-Dryja requires CSV only for revocability, and the CSV cannot prevent the enforcement of time-sensitive C. HTLCs seem to be an important building block for digital value transfers, and they (and their equivalents under scriptless) are sufficient for most practical transfers. Moving forward, Decker-Osuntokun-Russell remains a superior technology over Poon-Dryja.</p>
