    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kulpreet Singh, a researcher interested in measuring and tracking the changes in key metrics of the Lightning Network (LN) graph, wrote an article on Medium describing his approach to measuring node centrality in the network. He measured the centrality of nodes and central point dominance based on betweenness, as defined in a seminal paper by Lindon C. Freeman, and the number of articulation points in the network as per Robert E. Tarjan's algorithm. Singh also expressed interest in treating LN as a directed graph and doing some analysis based on treating LN as a flow network. Another researcher, Ren√© Pickhardt, responded with a message thanking Singh for sharing his work and providing links to his own work on c-lightning autopilot and heuristics for selecting nodes to which one could connect. Pickhardt suggested that his heuristic should reduce the articulation points and biconnected components mentioned by Singh, and that looking at the articulation points should not be their main focus. He also mentioned that he calculated the betweenness centrality and had similar results to Singh's, but that the difference was due to them not working on the exact same snapshot.</p>
