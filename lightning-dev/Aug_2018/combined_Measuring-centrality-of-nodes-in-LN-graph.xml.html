        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Kulpreet Singh, a researcher interested in the Lightning Network (LN), has been exploring ways to measure and track key metrics of the LN graph. He measured the centrality of nodes and central point dominance based on betweenness using well-known papers and measured the number of articulation points in the network. Singh shared his early results on Medium and expressed interest in analyzing LN as a flow network. In an email exchange with Elias Rohrer, another researcher, Elias suggested replacing the current source routing scheme's route selection algorithm with a flow-based approach and combining it with the atomic multi-path payment (AMP) scheme. Elias also identified that message complexity could be a significant challenge in the distributed case of LN and suggested solutions like introducing rounds or batching payments.In a separate email, Kulpreet wrote to René Pickhardt, another researcher, about measuring the centrality of various nodes in the LN graph and its dependence for routing payments and preventing network partitions. René responded by sharing his implementation of a first draft for the c-lightning autopilot and heuristics for selecting nodes to which one could connect. René also calculated the betweenness centrality and had similar results to Singh's research. In another email exchange between Elias and Kulpreet, they discussed several aspects related to the LN, including the practicality of the distributed execution as proposed in the Goldberg paper and implementation of the push-relabel algorithm in Go. Elias suggested having a look at average maximum flows between all or random nodes as a first idea. Overall, these researchers are exploring different aspects of the LN and trying to improve its functionality.</p>
