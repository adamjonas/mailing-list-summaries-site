        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Robert Olsson has suggested a new feature for the Lightning Network called "Free Rebalancing Proposals". This is a fee-less, omni-beneficial rebalancing scheme that aims to spread existing grease around the layer two for smoother operation. The proposal involves sending a message over a channel A, and the max amount you would propose to balance in that direction. Each node analyses the in and out channels and adjusts the max to its own desire to balance. Max can only be adjusted down. If everyone is happy with the proposed rebalancing, the origin node sends a payment along this node without dropping off any fees along the way since all nodes agreed and benefit from the rebalancing act.Rebalancing helps to solve problems by increasing redundancy and maximum possible routes. ZmnSCPxj argues that rebalancing is not a good solution, and suggests using off-to-on and on-to-off swapping instead. However, Robert questions the state before and after of channel D-C and postulates that in any case where rebalancing is possible, then a payment route exists that is sufficient for payment to the network. The author, Robert Olsson, has proposed a new function for the network called "Free Rebalancing Proposals" which is a fee-less, omni-beneficial rebalancing scheme. He proposes a better solution wherein a proposal-for-balancing-message is sent over channel A, and the max amount you would propose to balance in that direction is analyzed by each node. Since all intermediate nodes benefit, they are happy to do this without fees. The intermediate nodes might not need to keep track of any agreements to balancing proposals; it can simply call the freeBalancerMax function, and if the payment is lower, it passes on the payment even if it didn't get any fees. Otherwise, it fails as usual.The email conversation discusses a new function in the network called "Free Rebalancing Proposals", which is a fee-less, omni-beneficial rebalancing scheme. The proposed function can be used by both payers and payees to coordinate and locate a route that could be made free using the "free rebalancing" feature. The proposed solution works by sending a proposal-for-balancing-message over channel A, and the max amount you would propose to balance in that direction. Each node analyzes the in and out channels and adjusts the max to its own desire to balance. If everyone is happy (i.e. max>0), the origin node sends a payment along this node, without dropping off any fees along the way, since all nodes agreed and benefit from the rebalancing act.</p>
