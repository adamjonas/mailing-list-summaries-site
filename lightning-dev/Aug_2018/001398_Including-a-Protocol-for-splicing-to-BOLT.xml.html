    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Corn√© Plooy, a member of the Lightning-dev community, has highlighted that spontaneous payments are among the most requested features from users and developers. However, he realized that these payments can be easily achieved if the payer generates the preimage and hash, and includes the preimage in the sphinx message to the payee node. This method only works for donations as there is no proof of payment. If the payee node recognizes the sphinx message format, it can use the preimage to claim the payment.Another member of the community suggested that this feature was already described in the Brainstorming wiki. They discussed the need to make the Wiki more prominent for future reference. The link to the wiki page provided a detailed explanation of passing a transfer secret in the onion.</p>
