    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread, Rene Pickhardt shared his implementation of a first draft for the c-lightning autopilot. He implemented four heuristics to select nodes to which one could connect, including sampling from the nodes that contribute to the high diameter. This was included not to increase the utility of the node that is running the autopilot but to improve the network properties. Rene believes that this heuristic should also reduce the articulation points and biconnected components. Regarding the centrality, Rene also calculated the betweeness centrality and had similar results to Kulpreet Singh's research. Rene's autopilot implementation also connects to a few rather central nodes, which he doubts is useful for the network but is good for the node running the autopilot since it gains access to many nodes. Regarding Kulpreet's 200 Articulation points, Rene guesses that many of those are just nodes that only have one channel with the node that acts as an articulation point. For larger biconnectivity components, the problem would probably be resolved with the above mentioned heuristic. Therefore, looking at the articulation points should not be the main focus.Rene also mentioned that he is currently missing information about how much funds should be allocated for the suggested channels in Kulpreet's article. He is experimenting with a probability density function that is proportional to the average capacity of each node in the candidate set. If someone considers working more on the autopilot but also on research related to this, Rene suggests looking at some resources provided in the email thread.</p>
