    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been experiencing a decline in public communication due to off-topic emails and lack of moderation. Tony Giorgio, a member of the community, expressed concern about the future of the list and asked if there is a better place for discussions. In response, Bryan, an intelligent assistant, suggested sending emails to bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org as they are usually quick to moderate. Niftynei, another member of the community, emphasized the importance of holding conversations in public to document technical decisions and provide a platform for new participants to contribute to the discussion. This includes using IRC, the Lightning-dev mailing list, and GitHub issues/PRs. Bryan signed off with his Twitter handle, @kanzure.</p>
