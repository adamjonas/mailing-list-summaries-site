        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming attacks and experimenting with various schemes and reputation algorithms to achieve this goal. One proposed scheme is the HTLC endorsement scheme, which aims to prevent abuse during high-fee periods by ensuring reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic. The lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path creates a vulnerability issue for the endorsement scheme.To address this issue, the community proposes tracking local reputation for each node's peers based on their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them. Reputation is slow and expensive to build and fast to degrade, so sudden changes in behavior are short-lived. Each node locally tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocates a number of slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers based on its risk tolerance. Forwarding of HTLCs will depend on whether they are endorsed by a high reputation peer, with endorsement and reputation proposed as the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming.The conversation also discusses the importance of differentiating between fees charged by a node and their reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. The lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost raises vulnerability issues for the endorsement scheme, where there is nothing preventing a node from sacrificing their earned reputation to inflict a loss of routing fees damage on another node's incoming link. Reputation revenue is used to estimate the damage an attacker can create.Additionally, the conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in knowing how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. It was suggested that large routing nodes may have sufficient data to make informed decisions, while edges may be more vulnerable, but they would also be used by fewer senders, making the impact of an attack proportionally smaller.The Lightning-dev mailing list is a platform for developers and enthusiasts to discuss and develop the Lightning Network. Channel jamming has been a prevalent issue, and Carla and Clara have proposed a two-part scheme involving HTLC endorsement and reputation to mitigate this. However, Antoine points out that the HTLC endorsement scheme still suffers from vulnerabilities, making it essential to establish reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels accessible from its local counterparty granting a high level of reputation.The email thread discusses the challenges and uncertainties involved in implementing effective routing and compensation systems in the context of the HTLC endorsement model. The discussion concludes that while there are interesting projects, services, or even businesses in the area of reputation, it is not a protocol/P2P gossiping issue or a "core" of a Lightning node issue. Data gathering is considered valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list is an important resource for those involved in the development and implementation of Lightning technology. The reputation system has its limitations, but it can still be useful in providing some level of security guarantees. The implementation of reputation systems is also a topic of discussion, with suggestions for them to be separate from the protocol or P2P gossiping issues.The proposal for mitigating channel jamming involves each node locally tracking the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocating slots and liquidity based on their risk tolerance. Endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers will be given priority, while unknown HTLCs will only be forwarded if there are slots and liquidity available. Reputation and endorsement form the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming, with unconditional fees for quick jams being the second step.Finally, there is a discussion about creating an experimental data gathering mechanism for CLN and proposing using lnmetrics as a platform.</p>
