        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming and experimenting with various schemes and reputation algorithms to achieve this goal. Carla and Clara have proposed a two-part scheme involving HTLC endorsement and local reputation to mitigate channel jamming. Antoine points out the vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme proposed, making it essential to establish reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic.The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum time-value damage that one can inflict on a routing node channel accessible from its local counterparty granting this high-level of reputation. Each node locally tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocates slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. Reputation and endorsement are proposed as the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming. The email provides updates on channel jamming and includes details for the next call on May 1st. The group plans to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. The email outlines goals for this data gathering, including observing the effect of endorsement in the steady state, gathering real-world data for future simulation work, and experimenting with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.The conversation also revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in knowing how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. The impact of an attack on large routing nodes is discussed, with the assumption that there is sufficient data available for them to make informed decisions. However, during regular network operations, this should have little to no impact on their activity.Finally, the email proposes a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming: reputation for slow jams that are easily detected as misbehavior and unconditional fees for quick jams that are difficult to detect, as they can always fall under a target threshold. Each node tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocates a number of slots reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers, as well as a portion of liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. Forwarding of HTLCs depends on whether or not a HTLC is endorsed by a high reputation peer. If it is, it is forwarded as usual with endorsed = 1. Otherwise, it is forwarded with endorsed = 0 if there are slots and liquidity available for unknown HTLCs.The Lightning-dev mailing list provides a platform for discussing and developing the Lightning Network, where data gathering is considered valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. The discussion concludes that while reputation systems have limitations, they can provide better information than nothing and are useful in choosing a potential channel counterparty.Reputation schemes for mitigating channel jamming involve locally tracking the reputation of direct neighbors and allocating slots and liquidity based on risk tolerance, with endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers given priority. Good reputation is also a function of the general environment, and the price of a good reputation would be similar to the amount of damage they can create. Data gathering on repeat interactions from individual senders is important in informing decisions, while the issue of gossiping about reputations is addressed, stating that nodes are not gossiping about their peers' reputations.Additionally, there is an observation on the effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability. Sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution might break the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms, which could affect payment reliability. The email also discusses the lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path, which creates a vulnerability issue for the endorsement scheme. The author raises concerns about the possibility of a node sacrificing their earned reputation to inflict a loss of routing fees on another node's incoming link.However, it is important to differentiate between fees a node charges and reputation revenue, as reputation is determined as a function of the latter. Finally, the Lightning-dev mailing list is an important resource for those involved in the development and implementation of Lightning technology, providing a space for open communication and collaboration, helping to drive innovation and progress in the field.</p>
