    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in knowing how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. The impact of an attack on large routing nodes is discussed, with the assumption that there is sufficient data available for them to make informed decisions. However, the edges may be more vulnerable, but they are used by fewer senders, and the impact of an attack would also be proportionally smaller. A clarification is sought on what is meant by "individual senders" since nodes only track local reputation for their direct peers. It is explained that nodes track their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders. The confusion about mixing two different proposals is acknowledged, and an apology is given. It is agreed that nodes that forward fewer HTLCs are less likely to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. However, during regular network operations, this should have little to no impact on their activity. During an attack, small and low-activity nodes will temporarily compete for large routing nodes' scarce liquidity and slots but can still interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation.</p>
