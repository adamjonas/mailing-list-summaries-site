    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bastien Teinturier, a member of the Lightning Network development team sent a message to the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding the challenge of protecting against liquidity griefing attacks from malicious peers in dual funded transactions. When using 0-conf, accidentally double-spending a channel because of concurrent instances can result in the loss of funds for one of the peers if payments were made on that channel before detecting the double-spend. Additionally, nodes that want to offer 0-conf channels must ensure that the UTXOs they use for 0-conf are isolated from the UTXOs they use for non 0-conf. To address this issue, Bastien suggests never locking UTXOs used in dual funded transactions and proposes that UTXOs be locked after tx_completes have been exchanged if the channel has option_zeroconf and if the peer adds any inputs to the funding transaction, the process should be aborted as 0-conf is unsafe in this case. After the broadcast of the funding transaction, the 0-conf channel can be used. Eclair, the open-source Lightning Network implementation, is currently doing "opportunistic" 0-conf by immediately sending 'channel_ready' if it receives it immediately, knows that the peer does not have any input and the transaction hasn't been RBF-ed yet. However, when mixing 0-conf and non-0-conf funding attempts, soft locks may prevent upgrading to 0-conf. Bastien seeks ideas for improving the situation and offering good-enough protections against liquidity griefing for nodes offering 0-conf services.</p>
