    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>I apologize for the confusion. Here is a complete summary of the context:The discussion revolves around the presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself against accusations. The writer wants to defend themselves against Jeremy Rubin's accusations, but doesn't know where they can do so without being off-topic. They feel censored and judged unfairly, and want a public debate with Rubin to clear their name. The writer believes in the American First Amendment and feels that if something is off-topic everywhere, it is a censored taboo. They challenge moderators to censor their email and prove their point.In response to the writer's previous post on March 21st, Antoine Riard expresses his concerns about frivolous legal claims being used between bitcoin developers and organizations, which could cause a distortion of neutrality in development and a chilling effect on technical discussions. Riard believes that people who choose a career in open-source have accepted external accountability for their actions. He also thinks that communication channels for Bitcoin and Lightning development constitute a public forum and that participants' rights and capabilities to contribute should be protected.Riard also believes that exposing private elements of public personalities is a morally valid practice as long as it's proportional and familiar with public institutions in the US and Europe. However, he suggests that the discussion of principles should still be pursued on other channels, independent of private elements.Tony Giorgio, another member of the Lightning community, asks if there is a better place for public communication than this list, as it has been quiet since an off-topic email was sent. Niftynei responds by reiterating the importance of holding conversations in public for technical decisions and documenting the range of options considered. They believe that it provides an interface point for new participants to contribute to the discussion.</p>
