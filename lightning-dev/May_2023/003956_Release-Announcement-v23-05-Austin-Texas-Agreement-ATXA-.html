    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Core Lightning 23.05 release has been announced, named by @instagibbs. The release includes various changes, with the complete list of updates available in the changelog. For users, there are several new features including two new RPCs for blacklisting and listing stored runes, additional options for `feerates`, a new `listclosedchannels` RPC to show old, dead channels, and more. For the network, blinded payments are now supported by default, and bitcoin addresses are double-checked before issuing them to avoid memory errors. Slight overpaying is now allowed, even with MPP, as per the latest specifications. Developers will also find several improvements, such as PSBTv2 support, new methods from RPC to grpc mapping, and a new command in hsmtool to make a master rune for the node. Since 23.02.2, there have been 265 commits by 17 authors over 59 days. The release also marks the first-time contributions by Shahana Farooqui and Anmol Agrawal, for which they received a special thanks.</p>
