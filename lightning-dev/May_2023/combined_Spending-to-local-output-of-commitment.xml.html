        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Benjamin Weintraub has asked a question on the Lightning-dev mailing list about commitments in Lightning Network. He wanted to know what kind of witness script is required to redeem the `to_local` funds if a peer force closes a channel by sending a commitment to the blockchain and how to generate such a transaction. He also provided details of a specific transaction committed on a local simnet bitcoin blockchain and wanted to spend vout[2]. Ken Sedgwick responded to his query by directing him to the necessary witness described in this link: <a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md">https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md</a>#to_local-output. The GitHub page describes the necessary witness script for generating a transaction that spends the to_local and HTLC output following a force closure of the channel. The email conversation posted here is focused on discussing development related to the Lightning Network, a protocol layer built on top of Bitcoin that aims to improve scalability and speed of transactions. Keags also comments on the thread stating that he is unsure how to generate such a transaction with lncli or chantools. The email includes a block of code showing transaction details, such as the number of required signatures and addresses involved in the transaction. Additionally, contact information for Ken Sedgwick of Bonsai Software, Inc. is provided in the email.</p>
