    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Vincent, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, has suggested that lightning-dev mailing list may require additional moderators due to the increasing number of emails. Despite his views on the relationship between Bitcoin and Lightning discussions becoming intertwined, he believes that it would be sensible to keep both lists separate and simply increase the number of moderators for the lightning-dev list. This suggestion was discussed during an open meeting and two more active members have been added as moderators. Therefore, there should not be much delay moving forward.</p>
