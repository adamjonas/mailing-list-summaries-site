    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path, which creates a vulnerability issue for the endorsement scheme. The author raises concerns about the possibility of a node sacrificing their earned reputation to inflict a loss of routing fees on another node's incoming link. However, it is important to differentiate between fees a node charges and reputation revenue, as reputation is determined as a function of the latter. The email explains how reputation revenue is used to estimate the damage an attacker can create and suggests that nodes should put a higher bar than reputation revenue if they find having a high reputation with another node crucial. Additionally, there is an observation on the effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability. Sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution might break the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms, which could affect payment reliability. However, the email ends with uncertainty about what this means exactly.</p>
