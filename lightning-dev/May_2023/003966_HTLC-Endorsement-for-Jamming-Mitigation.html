    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the speaker is discussing the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. They provide an example of two nodes, Caroll and Bob, sharing the same parameters, including reputation revenue and routing windows. The speaker notes that Bob must decide whether to accept or refuse an HTLC forwarding request from Alice, depending on their judgment of Alice's reliability and the potential for a jamming attack. The compensation mechanism in this scenario is unclear to the speaker, and they suggest that there may be coupling effects between historical liquidity buckets and the introduction of an endorsement scheme. The speaker provides a link to comments on the LDK scoring engine for further information. Overall, the discussion centers around the challenges and uncertainties involved in implementing effective routing and compensation systems in the context of the HTLC endorsement model.</p>
