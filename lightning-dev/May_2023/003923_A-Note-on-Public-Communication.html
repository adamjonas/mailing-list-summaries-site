    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email to the Lightning-dev mailing list, niftynei emphasized the importance of public communication in technical discussions within the community. As a relatively new member of the open source software and specification work community a few years ago, niftynei was impressed by Rusty's insistence on holding conversations in public as much as possible. This includes using IRC, the mailing list, and GitHub issues/PRs. The benefits of public communication are twofold: documentation of the range of options considered for technical decisions and providing an interface point for new participants to contribute to the discussion. Niftynei pointed out that recent emails posted to the Lightning-dev mailing list make it clear that now is a good time to reiterate the importance and preference of public communication whenever possible, especially for specification or technical discussions. The email concludes with Nifty's signature.</p>
