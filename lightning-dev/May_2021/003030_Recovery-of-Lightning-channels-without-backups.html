    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Lloyd Fournier suggested to David A. Harding a fun idea related to backups for the Lightning Network. Fournier said that it is not easy to figure out whether it worked or not and also mentioned that backing up data in an encrypted form could reveal that the system is in recovery mode. In response, Harding assumed that nodes using the backup commons would go through the steps of downloading some number of backups each time they are restarted to check if the backups are being stored faithfully. Fournier raised two additional points: first, which nodes should be used for backups; and second, what data should be backed up. To address the first point, he proposed using rendezvous hashing to reduce the set of nodes for backups. For the second point, he suggested avoiding full backups as they slow down sending payments but may still be worth it for some users.</p>
