    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the author discusses different options for a practical approach to handling funds in a fast forward state. One option is to implement a "ask first" 3 round protocol. Another suggestion is to have `remote_penaltyclaimpubkey` owned by the node instead of the hardware device, allowing funds to accrue in the fast forward state and be swept into the commit tx at the merchant's discretion. However, it is noted that the funds in the FF state are more vulnerable than the main channel balance during that time because their keys are not in a secure device. The author draws an analogy to having cash in a till that is sent to a bank at the end of the day or week. The author also emphasizes the importance of privkeys being periodically online in case of theft attempts, which is not an additional requirement but a necessary one. However, they note that requiring periodic online presence for security purposes can be annoying for user experience.</p>
