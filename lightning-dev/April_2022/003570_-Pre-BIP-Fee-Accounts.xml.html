    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Jeremy Rubin questions the appeal to authority in regards to the confusion of some readers on bitcoin-dev mailing list. He clarifies that it's not about authority but rather not wasting the time of readers. Rubin further expresses his confusion on how OpenTimestamps (OTS) can support RBF for updating to larger commitments and still be correct without having an epoch-based re-committing scheme. He suggests that OTS may not be formally correct and has some holes in what is committed to or relies on clients re-requesting proofs if they fail to be committed. Rubin recommends that an actual spec for OTS should be created for more meaningful discussions. Rubin proposes that OTS should be changed rather than committing to a worse design in service of some unstated design goals. He suggests that linearization won't be a breaking change for old clients, just calendar servers, and new clients can benefit from linearization. However, Peter Todd argues that linearization for timestamping service doesn't prevent any attack and questions Rubin's understanding of cryptography.</p>
