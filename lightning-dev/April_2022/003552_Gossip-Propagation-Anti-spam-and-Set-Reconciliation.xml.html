    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alex Myers has been investigating set reconciliation to reduce bandwidth and redundancy of gossip message propagation in the Lightning network. This involves each node building a sketch representing its own gossip set, which is sent to another node for merging and identifying differences. However, since each implementation may have its own rules for gossip acceptance and propagation, the sets must match closely. Core-lightning implements rate limiting for incoming channel updates and node announcements, but 18% of publicly broadcasting half-channels fell afoul of spam-limiting rules at least once, with some flapping due to intermittent connections. A broader discussion of rate limits may be necessary, including a common listing of current default rate limits across implementations, internal checks of RPC input, and a commonly adopted rate-limit standard. Myers aims to create a set reconciliation gossip type that will use a common heuristic to accept or reject a gossip message, such as one channel update per block or per block height. This would aid in the development of gossip set reconciliation and benefit node connection and routing reliability more generally. He encourages a conversation regarding gossip propagation, channel_update and node_announcement usage, and bandwidth goals for syncing gossip in the future.</p>
