    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the message has been researching set reconciliation to reduce bandwidth and redundancy in gossip message propagation. The idea is that each node builds a sketch representing its own gossip set, which is then transmitted and merged with another node's sketch, resulting in differences that should ideally be the latest missing gossip of both nodes. However, sets must match closely, and each node and lightning implementation may have its own rules for gossip acceptance and propagation. Core-lightning implements rate limiting for incoming channel updates and node announcements, but the writer found that 18% of publicly broadcasting half-channels fell afoul of spam-limiting rules due to flapping or frequent updates. A relaxation of the rate limit resolved most cases, and the upcoming release of Core-Lightning will include updated rate-limiting. The writer suggests broader discussion of rate limits and adoption of a commonly accepted standard.</p>
