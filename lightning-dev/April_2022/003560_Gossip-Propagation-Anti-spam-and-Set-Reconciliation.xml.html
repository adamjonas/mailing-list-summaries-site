    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Lightning Network is facing problems with channel updates, as a large percentage of them are being rejected, leading to degenerate cases. While Matt Corallo suggested tuning the sync frequency to tackle the issue, it seems that the problem is severe, with 18% of channels hitting the spam limit when only one update is allowed per day. The high number of channel differences cannot fit inside a set and may cause synchronization issues. Gossip queries, which help in obtaining updates since a particular time, have been deemed perfect by some, but others believe that it might be broken in at least five ways. It could be used to remove some other features, but for enabling taproot and using blockheight as timestamps, a gossip2 may need to be created. This would support that one operation along with maybe a direct query op.Eclair does not rate limit and has faced no issues with it, but LND has found that limiting it can become problematic, especially if people restart their nodes once a day, resulting in two updates per day. The addition of this feature in version 0.11.0 has helped alleviate the issue.</p>
