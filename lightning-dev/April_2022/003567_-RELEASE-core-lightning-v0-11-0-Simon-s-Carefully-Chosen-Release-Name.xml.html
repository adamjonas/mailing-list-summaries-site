    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>C-Lightning has announced the 0.11.0 release, including several new features and enhancements. This version is the first under the rebranded "Core Lightning" name. Some of the highlights for users include support for multiple live channels to the same peer, full native GRPC support, external IP address advertising, the ability to specify two databases at once, pay supporting BOLT 11 payment metadata, and a significant speedup in start times for old nodes with many historical HTLCs. For the network, some of the key highlights include sending the remote node's IP address in the init message, being more aggressive in sending our own gossip to peers, announcing DNS addresses in node_announcement, and flushing sockets before closing. There are also several improvements for developers, such as a rust crate cln-rpc to easily interact with the JSON-RPC and msggen tool allows easy generation of language bindings for the JSON RPC interface. The release notes also include other details on various changes and bug fixes in this release. The team expressed their thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports and encouraged them to keep them coming. Since 0.10.2, C-Lightning has had 712 commits from 37 different authors over 170 days. A special thanks goes to the 18 first-time contributors.</p>
