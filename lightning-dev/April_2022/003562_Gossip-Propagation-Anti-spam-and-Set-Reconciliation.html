    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Alex Myers and Matt Corallo, the topic of rate-limiting and set reconciliation in Lightning Network's gossip protocol was discussed. While Eclair currently does not implement any rate-limiting, Alex suggests that set reconciliation should only be used after a node has fully synced gossip through traditional means such as initial routing sync and gossip queries. However, Matt disagrees with this approach and suggests that a minisketch-based sync should be used for initial sync after restart as it would be more efficient than the current methods. Additionally, Matt argues that a common rate-limit heuristic is needed to ensure efficiency in set reconciliation, especially since the network is constantly growing. While Alex acknowledges the need for tighter rules on rate-limiting, he also notes that the Erlay approach, which maintains a per-peer sketch and associated state for every gossip peer, could be too much overhead to maintain. Nevertheless, Alex will consider Matt's suggestions and experiment with different levers to maintain sync.</p>
