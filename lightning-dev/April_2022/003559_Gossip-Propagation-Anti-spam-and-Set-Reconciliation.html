    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Alex Myers and Bastien, Myers responded to feedback from Bastien about Eclair not having rate-limiting. Myers explained that they wanted to "feel the pain" before adding any such feature but acknowledged that set-reconciliation has forced him to confront the issue early. He stated that his thoughts on sync were that set-reconciliation would only be used once a node had fully synced gossip through traditional means and that there should be many levers to pull in order to help maintain sync after this. However, Bastien expressed concern over the removal of initial_routing_sync and the broken nature of gossip queries, suggesting the use of minisketch-based sync for initial sync after restart.</p>
