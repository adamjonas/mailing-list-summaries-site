        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about liquidity and payment flow in the Lightning Network, participants debated the concept of "stock of liquidity" as a metaphor for the network's ability to handle transactions. One participant argued that liquidity in the network is guaranteed by the ability to drop to chain and that running out of stock isn't something that gets automatically fixed by someone else coming in and buying something different.The conversation then shifted towards the classification of peers as "mostly a source", "mostly a drain", and "mostly balanced" by forwarding node operators and how CLBOSS should adopt a similar classification system. The importance of channel balance and payment flow in determining profits was also discussed, with the suggestion to monitor profits based on sales rather than rounding errors. The thread also touched on rebalancing channels and the issue of private information, as well as the proposal of an alternative to splicing.Another issue facing the Lightning Network is the disparity in fees paid by users due to routing issues and latency. The presence of altruistic users who forward payments for cheap or free, alongside profiteers trying to make a living offering Lightning services, complicates the situation. To address this issue, one proposal is max_msat throttling which avoids channel depletion cases. However, it has flaws and requires continuous payment flow/payment size curve. A token bucket rate limit might suffice per source/destination channel. There is also a need for a mechanism to move funds outside of the Lightning network.The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin. In this context, the discussion revolves around the issue of unbalanced flow in Lightning Network. Forwarding nodes sell IPpvHg or liquidity, and if they run out of stock, they cannot forward against the balance, leading to no profit. A forwarding node's stock of IPpvHg can be depleted by "mostly a drain" peers, and the stock received from "mostly a source" peers is less valuable.Actual forwarding node operators classify their peers based on their payment flow and want CLBOSS to do the same. If a forwarding node sells its stock of IPpvHg at a low price point, other nodes will buy them out and form an effective cartel, later selling them at a higher price. Channel balance is the integral of the sum of payment flows in both directions, and actual forwarding node operators are obsessed with it. The channel balance is private information, which can be used to buy cheaply-offered IPpvHg towards the same node and resell it later at a higher price.In the scenario discussed, Y charges high fees to forward from A to B, whereas X charges low fees to forward from A to B, causing X's channel to always be depleted in that direction. Y takes advantage of being constantly online to always be the first to route their rebalance through X when X's channel clears up. There are limitations on such an attack, including forego legitimate fee income and requiring capital for creating fake payment flows.The use of `htlc_max_msat` as a flow valve is flawed, and the best option is a decently high and non-zero `base_fee`. In an ideal world, a rate limit could suffice. The proposal to add mandatory global functionality to support onchain-to-offchain swaps would force any net receivers to move their funds from Lightning to on-chain and make available any global IPpvHg stocks towards them. In the given scenario, X and Y set their max_msat in the A to B direction to $2.25 to get balanced flows. X and Y are seeing $45,000 going each way, collecting $0.90 in routing fees per day, and their channel is not going out of balance. Meanwhile, Z sees $10,000 going from A to B, collecting $40 a day, but his channel runs out after 5 days, at which point he has collected a total of $200 and has to spend $200 rebalancing on-chain. Each person paying $5 to B pays $0.002045 in fees, while each person paying $1000 to A pays $0.01 in fees.To break even, Z could reduce his fee rate below 0.4% and increase his channel capacity above $50k. However, increasing the B->A channel flow would lead X and Y's flows to be unbalanced, causing payers to have to route more flow through Z. Therefore, it is necessary to have a mechanism to move funds outside of the Lightning network, so that every published node should have onchain/offchain swap capability.In a Lightning-dev forum, users discussed monetization and the undercutting of fees by CLBOSS. Some forwarding node operators think that CLBOSS is depleting its usable liquidity in the long term by undercharging fees for routing payments.</p>
