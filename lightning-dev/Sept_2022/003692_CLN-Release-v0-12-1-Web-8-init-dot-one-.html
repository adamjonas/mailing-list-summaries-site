    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The core-lightning 0.12.1 release has been announced, with no new features but several bug fixes and build improvements. It is recommended for users to upgrade from 0.12.0. The release includes fewer bugs, a fix for topology plugin crashes when it sees duplicate private channel announcements, and a correction in `getinfo` that no longer displays unannounced addresses and shows correct port for discovered IP addresses. Newly created channels were sometimes inexplicably disconnected and this issue has been resolved. For the network, bad gossip store reads and gossip propagation have been fixed. For developers, reliance on `mako` and `mrkd` python libraries has been removed. There have been 26 commits from five different contributors over 29 days since v0.12.0.</p>
