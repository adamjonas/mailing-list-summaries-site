        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent development in the Lightning Network, ratecards are being proposed as an alternative to the current fee proportional millionths and fee base msat for forwarding payments. The motivation behind introducing ratecards is to allow node operators to experiment with negative fees and to enable variable values for channel capacity. Negative fees can be implemented by expressing feerate card bands as negative numbers, allowing node operators to price the available liquidity in their channel at a discount.The proposed ratecard would allow channel operators to specify different rates for liquidity that will automatically update based on channel capacity. Payments are then priced differently depending on available capacity in a channel, enabling node operators to express fine-grained prices of their existing capacity with much reduced bandwidth burden. A TLV will be added to the channel_update gossip message, containing a ratecard with four 16-bit signed integers for each quarter of channel capacity.The discussion revolves around the use of rate cards in Lightning Network and its impact on privacy, scalability, and network capacity. However, there are concerns raised about pathfinding algorithms that depend on unscalable data collection, which could lead to centralized entities performing data collection to the detriment of the network's robustness and its participants' independence. Additionally, failed payment attempts can be indistinguishable from data collection probing, and it may not be realistic to expect payments to stop failing while prioritizing privacy of channel balances.Moving forward, the conversation shifts to the payment rates that Alice would be expected to pay while using Bob's forwarding node. The proposed rate is equal to the 0-25% band and could potentially push the available capacity into the lower range. Dave raises a question about whether this rate should be pro-rata or not. He suggests that Alice can still get almost proportional rates by sending fifty 1k payments sequentially through Bob's forwarding node.However, for Alice to pay proportional fees, she would need to have a precise estimate of the current division of funds in one of Bob's channels, which highlights the importance of having access to real-time information about the fund allocation in Bob's channels. The discussion emphasizes the challenges that users face while transacting through forwarding nodes and the need for a more dynamic fee calculation mechanism that can adjust to changing network conditions and ensure fair compensation for all parties involved in the transaction.Overall, the proposed ratecard is interesting, but further investigation is suggested to understand how it interacts with other proposals and how we can make it stronger by combining some of the other ideas. Advanced technologies such as blockchain can potentially address these challenges and enable seamless and efficient payment processing.</p>
