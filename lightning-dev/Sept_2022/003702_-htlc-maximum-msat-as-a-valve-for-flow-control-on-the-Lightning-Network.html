    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj discusses the assumption that a small decrease in 'htlc_max_msat' will lead to a decrease in payment volume. He notes that the driving decision on routing must be based on more than just fees to maintain a stable, decentralized network. Many forwarding node operators believe that CLBOSS undercuts fees too much and depletes usable liquidity in the long term, so they want it modified to raise fees and preserve liquidity supply. However, channel saturation due to being cheaper by 0.0001% is not something that will occur often as most operators will settle for a feerate that maximizes their earnings per unit liquidity provided. The market will fix itself once more rational automated actors are in place. The fact that fees can be paid by someone else other than senders can make gossiped feerates less effective.</p>
