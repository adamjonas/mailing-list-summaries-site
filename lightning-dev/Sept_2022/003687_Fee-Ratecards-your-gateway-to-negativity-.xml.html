    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list conversation, Lisa Neigut described the concept of a ratecard, which is a set of four values used to price different bands of available liquidity for a channel. This means that spenders wanting to send an LN payment will either need to estimate the current division of funds for every hop along their projected path or pay the highest ratecard for each hop. However, this could lead to the creation of services that collect information and become central to LN's operation if there is no easy and network-friendly way for spenders to gather that information. As an example, if a payment moves 50k through a 100k channel which is currently at a total available capacity of 75k sats, that payment will be expected to pay a rate equal to the 0-25% band, as it'll push the available capacity into the 0-25% range. Dave questions whether this should be pro-rata and suggests that Alice can still get almost proportional rates by sequentially sending Bob's forwarding node fifty 1k payments. However, for Alice to pay proportional fees either way, she'd need a precise estimate of the current division of funds in one of Bob's channels.</p>
