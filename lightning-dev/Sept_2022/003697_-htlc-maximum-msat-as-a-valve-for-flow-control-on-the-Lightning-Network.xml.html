    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation between multiple individuals, the idea of throttling payment traffic independently of fees was discussed. It was noted that this would be beneficial for stability and optimization, as small changes in fees can cause large changes to traffic volume. However, it was also mentioned that this may depend on what becomes popular for sender algorithms. If senders begin to quantize their payments by selecting a "standard" value and dividing all payments into multipath sub-payments of this value, it could simplify the computation of base fee when using a min-cost solver, improve privacy, and simplify splitting/merging decisions if not using a min-cost solver. If this occurs, there would likely be a large discontinuity for the `htlc_max_msat` vs `htlcs_sent` curve around whatever selected quantum there is. Additionally, it was noted that at least fees provide basic economics of supply and demand, which is a natural throttle in all markets, including liquidity markets.</p>
