    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Lloyd Fournier, Rusty, and Zman, they considered the idea of doing one signaling transaction out of a group of inputs. However, Lloyd expressed concern that this approach would not prove ownership of the other inputs. Rusty explained that this was by design and suggested that two peers could be contacted to produce a single transaction.The issue with a signaling transaction is that it can be difficult to determine if it conflicts with other transactions. Mallory can use a single UTXO to probe for everyone's UTXO simultaneously, which creates a problem for Bob. He wants to wait 60 seconds to see if there is a conflicting transaction in his mempool while also broadcasting it as soon as possible to signal others. Bob wants to do both before revealing his own UTXOs.There is no clear solution to this problem, but Rusty prefers this approach over PoDLE.</p>
