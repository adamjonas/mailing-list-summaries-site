        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread between Rusty Russell and others discusses the impact of Taproot on a heuristic from a paper. While Taproot does not affect the heuristic, it can be useful for keeping private channels private against a certain method that involves funding public channels and using the change to fund another public channel, which can identify the owner of the node that funded both channels. However, there are concerns about the ownership of other inputs when only one signaling transaction is performed out of the whole group of inputs, as it may allow adding whale output from the chain to trick the peer's algorithm. The proposal suggests changing PoDLE to give it an advantage in parallel attacks, but this scheme has several downsides, including leaking information and being weak against parallel attacks. To address these issues, the proposal suggests using H0 and H1 as 32-byte output hash functions and attaching a PoDLE containing the public key for an input and P2 to any of the tx_add_input messages. The peer checks the validity of the PoDLE and creates a "claim" message claiming the UTXO, which it broadcasts if it hasn't received a valid claim message with H0(P2) and a valid MAC. Any node receiving the claim message re-broadcasts the message to its peers. However, there are concerns that the proposal creates a new extra bit of data that can be used for chainalysis, making the proposal redundant.The post also discusses a dual funding proposal that uses DLEQ proof (PoDLE) to prevent attackers from learning which available UTXOs are controlled by LN users. The author notes that while PoDLE may be more secure, it is also more complex. Ultimately, the choice of protocol depends on how much weight is given to preventing griefing versus simplicity and ease of use.Finally, the email exchange between Lloyd Fournier and Rusty Russell highlights the practical problem with a signaling transaction, as it's difficult to tell if it's conflicting. Lloyd Fournier suggests changing the scheme to broadcast h2 as soon as they have agreed to create a transaction with the initiator. This scheme is effective and would break the "middleman" idea unless Alice funds with two UTXOs or there is some way for all parties involved in the funding to distinguish gossiped h2s from their funding session from others.</p>
