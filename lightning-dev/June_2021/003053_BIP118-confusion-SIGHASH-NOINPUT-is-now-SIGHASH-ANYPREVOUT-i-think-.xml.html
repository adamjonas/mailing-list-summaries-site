    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ryan Grant has pointed out confusion among people who are not aware of the recent updates to the bip118 draft. Substantial changes were made in May 2019, including its official name being changed to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, which is discussed in the "Revisions" section. However, the version in bitcoin/bips remained unchanged until recently collecting a minor fix. With taproot activating, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT will be the preferred method to ease lightning network client state requirements. Ryan Grant is not sure why the updated draft of bip118 is not being considered by a wider audience. The discussion can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/943">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/943</a> and the relevant links are provided there as well.</p>
