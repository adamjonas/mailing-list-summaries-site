    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network (LN) protocol is considering the addition of a BIP-style process called bLIPs or SPARKs to handle features and best practices that are not part of the current BOLT process. The goal is to have a place for app layer best practices to be succinctly described and organized, especially those that require coordination. This would bring LN innovations on the app layer into the fold instead of leaving them buried in old mailing list posts or not documented at all. Some potential bLIP ideas include each lnurl variant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote node connection standards, and more. Developers from various implementations and the broader app layer ecosystem will be listed as editors if they volunteer to help with this process. The proposed bLIP process is based on BIP-0002 and would not affect the existing BOLT process.</p>
