    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the sender is thanking someone named Z for resolving a matter. The sender notes that they are on the same page but need clarification on one point. Z had explained that in their model, Bob can always recover all signatures sent by Alice even if Carol is corrupted by Alice, modeling the signature-deletion attack as impossible. However, Z had mentioned that this was a weakening of the security of the scheme and that if Bob does not take mitigations, Bob could be vulnerable to a signature-deletion attack, which could put all funds in hostage. The sender clarifies that when Z says "all," it refers only to the funds in the fast forward, while funds consolidated into the channel balance are not at risk as long as the correct state is enforced on the chain. The sender believes that it should be easy to get a stream of signatures so that they cannot be deleted. Bob creates and sends the invoices, so they can always demand and save the signatures from Carol that correspond to each payment, thus thwarting the deletion attack.</p>
