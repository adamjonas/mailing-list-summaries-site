    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and package-relay in Bitcoin Core's longer-term roadmaps. The current set of contributors is spread across various projects that didn't exist pre-2017, making it harder for decentralized projects like Bitcoin Core to keep up with longer-term roadmaps.Antoine Riard, a developer on the Lightning Network, has written a post proposing two solutions to fix the pre-signed feerate problem. One solution involves package-relay while the other involves SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. However, there are concerns about attackers using pinning to force honest users to pay another anyprevout bounty to miners.The thread discusses the eltoo proposal, where signing the update transaction with SIGHGASH_ANYPREVOUT lets you attach non-interactively a single-party controlled input at broadcast-time. This should allow the transaction to propagate across network mempools and solve the pre-signed feerate problem as defined in the post.Further, the thread discusses package relay and its usefulness for CPFP fee bumping very low feerate transactions received from an external party. There are concerns about malicious mempool partitions, and package-relay might serve in the long-term as a mempool-sync mechanism.Finally, there is a discussion about creating timelines that depend on the work of a large number of contributors who may not feel entitled to be consulted in a decentralized development process. It is important to gather diverse in-field authorities' opinions or reason from scratch based on raw, public facts.Riard emphasizes the importance of acting on safety holes previously identified by contributors and criticizes the notion of creating timelines without consulting a large number of contributors involved in the project. He invites others to use, study, share, and modify his ideas to build better systems.</p>
