    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Tor Project will drop support for v2 hidden services in their latest release, with all supported releases dropping this support by October. Bitcoin Core has already defaulted to v3 and plans to drop v2 support for the 0.22 release. C-lightning is also deprecating the configuration of Tor v2 services starting next release, with its support expected to be dropped three releases after that. However, it should be noted that Tor is a centralized system, so when they drop v2 support, v2 hidden services will stop working on the Tor network. Therefore, it is pointless to keep supporting v2 hidden services beyond Tor's stated deadlines.</p>
