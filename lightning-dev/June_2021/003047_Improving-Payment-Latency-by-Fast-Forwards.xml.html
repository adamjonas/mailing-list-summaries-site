    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context is a discussion between LL and ZmnSCPxj regarding the need for "symmetrically encumbered outputs" in fast-forward (FF) transactions. ZmnSCPxj suggests an asymmetric protocol, where the offerer creates and signs a new commitment tx with the HTLC and patches their balance output by sending a transaction to a new tx which contains the HTLC output and their balance output unencumbered. The HTLC then becomes irrevocably committed from the receiver's perspective, and the offerer can repeat the process without having the receiver's revocation keys online or their commitment tx keys for many HTLCs while still having balance towards the receiver. Once the receiver brings their keys online, they can consolidate the FF state into new commitment txs on both sides and operate the channel normally. This approach takes advantage of the fact that commitments on both sides are desynchronized with each other. ZmnSCPxj believes this approach is workable without symmetric encumbrance and provides details of how it would work.</p>
