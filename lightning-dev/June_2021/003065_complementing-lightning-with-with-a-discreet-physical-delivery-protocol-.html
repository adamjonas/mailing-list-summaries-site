    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email shares a repository, <a href="https://github.com/VzxPLnHqr/discreet-physical-delivery-protocol,">https://github.com/VzxPLnHqr/discreet-physical-delivery-protocol,</a> as initial research on how some features of lightning such as hodl invoices, payment points, and dlcs can be used to create a network for physical delivery of items. The author asks for feedback on whether hodl invoices, which have been proposed for atomic item delivery, are still a primary culprit of some attacks on the network and if lightning in a post-taproot world solves any of these issues. The author provides a quick refresher on how lightning and hodl invoices can be used for atomic package delivery, using the example of Merchant Mary operating an e-commerce website, Purchaser Paul buying something, and Charlie being the independent courier. The process involves generating a preimage and sending its hash to Mary during checkout, creating a hodl invoice with hash, paying the invoice but not settling it yet because preimage is unknown to Mary, creating another hodl invoice for delivery costs, giving the package to Charlie, delivering the package to Paul, giving preimage to Charlie upon delivery, settling his outstanding invoice with Mary, and then revealing preimage to Mary who settles her outstanding invoice with Paul. The author believes that allowing this process to be multi-hop and blinding the physical location from one hop to the next is non-trivial but seems doable and asks for input on these types of protocols that combine digital and physical worlds.</p>
