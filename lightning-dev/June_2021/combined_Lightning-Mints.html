        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The potential benefits of Chaumian mints or blind mints in making hosted lightning wallets more private and secure have been discussed in a blog post by Casey Rodarmor. Blind mints offer a solution to usability challenges presented by self-hosted lightning wallets and can be operated as federated, offering excellent privacy, usability, security, and scaling for users. While Chaumian mints have largely been forgotten, they now have access to Bitcoin, which makes them an economical and fast option. However, Chaumian mints are inherently custodial, meaning the mint can deny all its clients access to their funds and run off with the money to unknown places. Wasabi and WabiSabi avoid this issue by operating as a temporary entity, whose output is then counterchecked by the users of the scheme. Nodelets allow multiple users to implement a single node without a central custodian, but every action requires all users to have keys online.A discussion about federated mint has been going on for some time, with the focus on replacing blinded signatures with blinded credentials. The use of tokens of the same denomination in traditional mints is inefficient, so introducing blind signatures committed to a separately blinded amount would allow one big anonymity set over all tokens instead. However, there are still obstacles to overcome, including the use of KVACs which do not allow client-side validation and building an enhanced threshold blind signature scheme which is more complex, needing further research.Federated chaumian banks that interface exclusively with the Bitcoin and Lightning networks could evade regulators and serve a global audience without being tied to a particular country or region. Additionally, the node management problem can be solved by something similar to CLBOSS software. While projects like CLBOSS are useful, it may not be possible for management software to fully abstract over things like high fees, uptime requirements, and unexpected fund unavailability due to channel closure.In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and elsirion, the concept of federated mints and its potential drawbacks were discussed. They also brought up the idea of WabiSabi, which replaces blinded signatures with blinded credentials, and the obstacles that may arise from implementing it in a federated context. Additionally, they discussed the nodelets system as an interesting idea for technical people but may be suboptimal for non-technical users. The conversation then shifts to the topic of custodial systems evolving into banks and the need for a backup plan in the form of federated mints.</p>
