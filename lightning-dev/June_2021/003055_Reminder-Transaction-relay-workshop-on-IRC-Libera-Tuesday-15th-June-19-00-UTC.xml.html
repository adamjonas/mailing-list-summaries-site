    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Tomorrow, June 15th, the 1st transaction relay workshop will take place on #l2-onchain-support Libera chat from 19:00 UTC to 20:30 UTC. The scheduled topics include "Guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design," "Coordinated cross-layers security disclosures," and "Full-RBF proposal." Notes and open questions for the first two topics can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ariard/L2-zoology/blob/master/workshops/guidelines.md">https://github.com/ariard/L2-zoology/blob/master/workshops/guidelines.md</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ariard/L2-zoology/blob/master/workshops/coordinated.md">https://github.com/ariard/L2-zoology/blob/master/workshops/coordinated.md</a>. The workshop will stick to a socratic format to foster knowledge sharing among attendees with the goal of reaching rough consensus about expected goals. Those who may find the workshops of interest include second-layer protocol designers, Lightning devs, Bitcoin Core dev contributors around mempool/p2p areas, or Bitcoin service operators with intense usage of the mempool. The "Move toward full-rbf" proposal will be sent soon and deserves its own thread. It's important to note that the workshop will be held on Libera, not Freenode as previously mentioned in a prior mail about agenda & schedule.</p>
