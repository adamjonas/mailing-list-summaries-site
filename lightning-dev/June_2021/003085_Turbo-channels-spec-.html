    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Bastien and Rusty are discussing the implementation of `option_zeroconf` for channels. They agree that a signal is needed to indicate that a channel uses zero-conf, and the two options they consider are setting `min_depth = 0` or using a `channel_type` that sets `option_zeroconf`. They ultimately decide that the second option is better because it allows them to keep a "normal" `min_depth` set and ensures that the channel is safe to use once `funding_locked` is sent. They also discuss when to send `announcement_signatures`. The spec states that it must not be sent until `funding_locked` has been sent and received AND the funding transaction has at least six confirmations. Rusty points out that the `min_depth` in `accept_channel` cannot be set to zero because the channel_id is needed before `announcement_signatures` can be sent. Ultimately, they determine that they are still compliant with the spec on this issue.</p>
