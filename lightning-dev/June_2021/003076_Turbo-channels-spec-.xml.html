    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to assign a new feature bit for accepting zeroconf channels, which have been hackable for some time. The proposal aims to unlock new user experiences for platforms and formalize the use of 0conf. It is desired by every wallet and LN exchange, showcasing something that only LN can uniquely offer as a UX. The proposal is considered a simple change that would also create a new set of channel types. Nodes are advised not to forward HTLCs from an unconfirmed channel unless they have explicit reason to trust that node. John Carvalho has pointed out that not every implementation accepts zero-conf channels, but they are useful. Roasbeef has also recently noted that they're not spec'd. Rusty Russell initiated the discussion and offered to draft something this week.</p>
