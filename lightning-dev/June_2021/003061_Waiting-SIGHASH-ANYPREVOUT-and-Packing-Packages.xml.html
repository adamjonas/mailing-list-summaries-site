    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread revolves around the Lightning Network and its implementation. The conversation touches on various topics such as the eltoo design proposal, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, pinning attacks, and fee-bumping techniques. It also discusses the use of package-relay and its potential permanence or deprecation. There are differing opinions on these topics, and the discussion encourages collaboration within the Bitcoin community.Antoine Riard, a member of the Lightning community, shares his thoughts on two potential solutions for the pre-signed feerate problem in Lightning: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. While SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT may work for current LN-penalty, there are concerns about its effectiveness with eltoo. Dave Harding suggests that more detailed write-ups on these ideas should be published before they are promoted further. Antoine suggests a rough deployment timeline, but Dave cautions against creating timelines without consulting numerous contributors first.Overall, the conversation encourages open sharing and modification of ideas within the hacker ethos of the community. The thread concludes with a call to action to address safety holes in the ecosystem before they become harmful.</p>
