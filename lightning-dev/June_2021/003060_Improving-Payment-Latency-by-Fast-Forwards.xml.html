    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the security of a Lightning Network proposal. The model assumes that Bob mitigates signature deletion to prevent all funds from being held hostage. Bob can demand and save signatures from Carol the Cashier, who cannot steal channel funds as she does not have Bob's private keys or the entire set of revocation keys. However, Alice+Carol cannot cooperate to steal funds already in the channel, but they can only steal funds from payments that Bob has not come online to claim yet. In comparison to an older proposal, the proposed scheme is more complex and requires a new state machine and protocol to implement, with increased potential for CVEs. The older proposal is simpler and can reuse existing code and tests. Despite this, the proposed scheme has an advantage in that Carol the Cashier can be operated by Bob rather than Alice, reducing the risk experienced by Bob.</p>
