        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard and Michael Folkson recently discussed the challenges of roadmaps in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin. They agreed that putting specific version numbers on changes is speculative and misleading. The conversation also touched on coordinating across different Bitcoin layers and concerns about layer-monoculture cropping up.In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard proposed two potential solutions to the pre-signed feerate problem: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The discussion included considerations related to fee-bumping algorithms, mempool policies, and L2 protocols. Riard emphasized the importance of addressing safety holes and the potential harm of inaction, as well as the importance of an open exchange of ideas and a hacker ethos.The Lightning Network is exploring solutions to the pre-signed feerate issue, with package-relay and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT being potential options. However, there are concerns about attackers using pinning to force honest users to pay additional fees to miners. Package-relay is seen as a temporary patch and improvement for low feerate transactions received from external parties.Creating deployment timelines without consulting the large number of contributors working on the project is considered inappropriate. The conversation between Riard and Folkson highlighted the need for ongoing discussion and collaboration to make progress in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin.The email thread discusses various topics such as the eltoo proposal, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, pinning attacks, fee-bumping techniques, and the use of package-relay. There are differing opinions on these topics, and the discussion encourages collaboration within the Bitcoin community.Antoine Riard shares his thoughts on two potential solutions for the pre-signed feerate problem in Lightning: package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT with eltoo. Detailed write-ups on these ideas are suggested before further promotion.The conversation emphasizes the importance of open sharing and modification of ideas within the hacker ethos of the community. The thread concludes with a call to action to address safety holes in the ecosystem before they become harmful.Overall, the email thread discusses potential solutions to the pre-signed feerate problem in Lightning Network, the challenges of coordinating across different Bitcoin layers, and the importance of ongoing discussion and collaboration in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin.</p>
