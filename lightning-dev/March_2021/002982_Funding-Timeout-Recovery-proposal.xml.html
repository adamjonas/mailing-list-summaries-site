    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian has written a proposal called "Funding Timeout Recovery" which outlines an alternative solution to using pre-signed commitment transactions to recover botched funding. The proposal can be found on GitHub and describes how the fundee signs a blank check with the funding_privkey, using `sighash_none` to make the signature independent from outputs. This allows the funder to create a close transaction in any way they want, including adjustable feerates and desired outputs. Christian also includes a recovery mechanism for malleated funding transactions which is optional. There are some open questions at the bottom of the proposal and Christian requests everyone's opinion on safety due to the funding_privkey = channel mapping. As it is short notice for the spec meeting, he plans to add it to the agenda for next time.</p>
