    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the difference between bruteforcing on a CSV delay and a BIP32 wallet with look ahead keys. The number of variants to look for can be a big multiplier in the case of CSV as it can be specified by the counterparty. For instance, if one accepts up to 1024 and offers 144, that's 880 variants to look for per key. However, this problem can be solved by restricting CSV delays to be multiples of 144 between 144 and 2016 which would only be 14 variants. It is also mentioned that such a process cannot be done with a normal bitcoin wallet. However, it wouldn't work for local commitments. Thus, it is suggested that alignment of incentives should prevail here and funds are still recoverable with just the seed which is a huge improvement compared to the current situation.</p>
