        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A paper has been published by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias and Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos that formalizes the cryptographic framework of Universal Composition and proves its security in relation to the Lightning Network. The formal proof of security is necessary to specify precise operating parameters to safeguard user funds and transactions against arbitrary attackers. It also validates the underlying cryptography used in the Lightning Network, incorporates it into cryptographic protocols, and increases trust in the wider community. Lloyd Fournier provided feedback on the paper, suggesting that the ideal functionalities could be simpler and more intuitive, with reasonable assumptions rather than cluttering up the ideal functionality. He also raised concerns about ensuring that transactions in the real world are indistinguishable from those in the ideal world. Orfeas responded by stating they were working on clarifying this for Sprites/SaUCy, and a similar constraint needs to be defined for blockchain UC to make sense. The paper is co-authored by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, and any feedback will be appreciated.</p>
