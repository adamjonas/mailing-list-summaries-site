    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a proposal in Adelaide, CSV delays were suggested to be symmetric. The idea was that the output would be delayed to avoid any confusing situations where both parties wait for the other to close. However, Roasbeef pointed out that this undermines the usefulness of option_static_remotekey, which allows for easy disaster recovery using only a master seed. In some cases, people may delete everything but keep their seed. Although they could still use the maximum value of the two sides' CSV, since it is already a choice that sides can make, Rusty suggests abandoning the proposal altogether. He asks for thoughts on the matter.</p>
