    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the use of MAC and encryption in REST APIs, Alex proposes two different payment approaches for lightning payments that could be used to minimize risks for DoS attacks. One approach is to purchase an auth token upfront that allows access for a certain amount of time or requests, while the other is to pay per request. ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about Nadav's scheme reducing the client-server interaction and increasing the risk of a DoS attack when larger data payloads are involved. He also suggests that encrypting data after proof-of-payment is shown would require more resources on the client side, but it would prevent a client from requesting and receiving data immediately without paying. Overall, the group discusses various strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with using lightning payments for REST APIs.</p>
