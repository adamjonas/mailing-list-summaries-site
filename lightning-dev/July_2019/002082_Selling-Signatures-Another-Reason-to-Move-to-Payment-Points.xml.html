    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Nadav Kohen proposed a scheme to privately sell data using the Lightning Network. He also posted a proposal for a decentralized setup with normal DLC oracles that can be used for all kinds of things. In this setup, the oracle is still not learning about the contract, just like normal DLCs. Nadav's proposal can be achieved in a relatively straightforward way using ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars. The (Schnorr) signature seller could give the buyer their one-time public key and using this value as the payment point, the buyer could be assured that they pay if and only if they receive the desired valid signature of m from the seller. Nadav also provided a link to a comprehensive write-up on how to make a DLC and mentioned that the txid and such of their CET can be found in a block explorer. Additionally, he shared a link to a document that might interest readers who want to learn more about CET.</p>
