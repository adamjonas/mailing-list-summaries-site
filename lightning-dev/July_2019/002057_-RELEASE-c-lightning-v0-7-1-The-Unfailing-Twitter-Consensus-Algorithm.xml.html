    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>C-Lightning, the Lightning Network implementation written in C language by Blockstream developers, has released a new version 0.7.1 that offers several improvements to users and network. The highlights of this release include faster and less memory-heavy Gossip, infrastructure to fund a channel from an external wallet, display of how many confirms until channel is open, ability to set a minimum channel size to accept, default invoice expiry time increased to seven days, fundchannel can now specify exactly what utxos to use, improved JSON API corner cases and bugs removed, and more plugin hooks. On the network side, the communication with peers has been optimized, tiny 1000 satoshi channels have been disallowed, option_upfront_shutdown_script is respected and enforced, and compatibility has been improved with Eclair and lnd (especially older versions).The full details can be found on the Github release page and the contributions made by several developers and bug reporters are highly appreciated by the team.</p>
