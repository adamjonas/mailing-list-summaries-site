    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the email thread, Lloyd Fournier expressed his thoughts on Orfeas's paper on formalizing the Lightning Network in the cryptographic framework of Universal Composition (UC) and its security. He mentioned that he found the ideal functionalities in UC should be simple and intuitive. He suggested including some reasonable assumptions rather than cluttering up the ideal functionality. Lloyd also raised a concern about how to ensure that transactions in the real world are indistinguishable from the ideal world since on-chain transactions can lead to distinguishability. Orfeas responded by stating that they were actively working on clarifying this for Sprites/SaUCy. They need to define a similar constraint like "smart contract isolation respecting protocols" for blockchain UC to make sense. Orfeas posted their paper about formalizing LN in the cryptographic framework of UC and proving its security. They believe that a formal proof of security was needed to specify the exact operating parameters that safeguard the funds and transactions of users against arbitrary attackers. The paper is authored by Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos and Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, and any feedback will be greatly appreciated.</p>
