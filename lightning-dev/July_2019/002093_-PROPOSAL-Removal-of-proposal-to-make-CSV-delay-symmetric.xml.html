    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the number of choices required for lightning network commitments, where it is suggested that one out of the given options is more than enough. It is also mentioned that local commitments may not be in play most of the time, but remote commitments will come into effect if the node drops out. Although, refund delay after a local commitment creates an opportunity for users to do unexpected things. The idea of having a recovery tool to rescue funds from a pre-lightning wallet is considered a good approach, and the Electrum team could help in supporting this heuristic. However, there is some uncertainty with this method as it depends on the close's exact nature and whether it will appear in the user's wallet.</p>
