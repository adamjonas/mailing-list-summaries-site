    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Rusty and Pierre, the topic of discussion is the difference between bruteforcing on the CSV delay and a BIP32 wallet with look ahead keys. Specifically, Pierre asks how the two methods differ, especially when trying the most probable values first.Bruteforcing on the CSV delay involves repeatedly guessing at a password until the correct one is found. This method can be time-consuming and may not be effective if the password is strong. On the other hand, a BIP32 wallet with look ahead keys involves generating a sequence of public keys in advance, which can then be used for transactions without revealing the private key. Pierre's suggestion of trying the most probable values first could potentially reduce the amount of time needed for bruteforcing, but Rusty does not address whether this would be an effective strategy. The conversation ends with no clear conclusion on which method is superior.</p>
