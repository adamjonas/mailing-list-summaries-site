        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network protocol for multi-path routing schemes has an issue of stuck payments due to one malicious actor interrupting the entire payment process. To improve speed and reliability, Rene Pickhardt proposed a congestion and flow control mechanism inspired by TCP's windowing mechanism. The base version protocol splits a regular payment on the Lightning Network into up to n paths with a sha-chain of preimages and payment hashes. However, this method lacks atomic proof-of-payment. So, Pickhardt suggested that the payee creates s sha-chains of n payment hashes to solve the atomicity problem. The proposed mechanism can be extended for a streaming payments protocol with two new fields in BOLT 11 invoices and rather simple code changes for invoice creation/preimage releasing.There are still some issues with privacy and congestion on the Lightning Network when it comes to streaming live data. It is possible that a payee receives only a fraction of all payments and stops collaborating, and there may be significant congestion on the network due to the high rate of payments. To address these issues, the email suggests adding XOR on preimages with a sequence number or a unique number to make it harder for attackers to correlate two consecutive payments. Additionally, congestion and flow control protocols may be more appropriate for streaming live data on the Lightning Network. Despite these issues, Pickhardt believes that the proposed mechanism could reduce load from the network, and a few stuck payments can be neglected as "cost" of operation.</p>
