    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made by Nadav Kohen for a scheme that would allow a trusted data provider to sell data privately using the Lightning Network. However, he also addressed a situation where an untrusted party could attempt to sell its signature to a known message, which could be useful in situations such as offering a DLC-like Option contract. In this example, the buyer of signatures must ensure that they pay only if they receive valid signatures for Contract Execution Transactions (CETs). To achieve this, ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars could be used. The seller could give the buyer their one-time public key, through which the buyer could compute the payment point whose scalar is the seller's signature. By using this value as the payment point, the buyer can be assured that they will pay only if they receive the desired valid signature. The downside of this proposal is that the seller knows which signature they are selling and therefore learns what kind of contract the buyer is involved in.</p>
