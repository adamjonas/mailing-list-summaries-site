        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a layer 2 payment protocol designed to enable secure and fast transactions for Bitcoin. However, it has some risks associated with it, including griefing attacks. To address this issue, the proposed solution called "proof-of-closure" introduces a "soft" sidereal-time-based timeout that is not enforceable on-chain but can protect intermediate nodes against payer/payee collusions.Proof-of-closure involves significant changes to the update state machine and requires each node on the network to advertise a timeout delta, and each invoice contains a final timeout measured in fractions of a second. If a soft timeout is violated, the channel is dropped on-chain and reported upstream. The mechanism aims to punish any party that delays or fails to deliver an HTLC. However, there are potential issues with giving proof of closure, as it is equivalent to actually closing the channel, making it unsafe to revoke the closure.To prevent privacy loss, the Lightning Network plans to use payment points and add a blinding scalar at each hop, also known as payment decorrelation. In the future, there will be no HTLCs, but instead, a PTLC, where the payment point at each hop will be changed to prevent decorrelation. While proof-of-closure offers a promising solution that addresses the issue without creating economic barriers against normal payments, further investigation is needed to address potential issues and ensure the effectiveness of this solution. It is crucial to be aware of the risks associated with each step of the update process to properly navigate it and ensure the safety of funds.</p>
