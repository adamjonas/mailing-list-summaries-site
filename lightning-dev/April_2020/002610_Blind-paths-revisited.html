    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bastien Teinturier proposed a route blinding scheme to improve wallet users' privacy. The proposal, available on GitHub, is designed to simplify the scheme and make it clear that it uses the same secrets derivation as Sphinx. Some parts of the proposal, such as invoice fields and encrypted blob format, are kept vague so they can be enriched based on early prototype implementations. Bastien addressed some comments made by Rusty Russell in previous mails, stating that the goal of payment_secret is to avoid having the next-to-last node discover it to prevent probing, and he does not think that using blinding to replace it would work. Additionally, Bastien noted that the secrets established with anonymous multi-hops locks are between the sender and each of the hops, whereas the secrets added in route blinding are between the recipient and the hops, and the sender should not influence those secrets. It is unclear if the recipient could safely contribute to those secrets, but Bastien is hopeful that a trick will be found in the future.</p>
