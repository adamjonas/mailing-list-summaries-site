        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a payment protocol designed to facilitate fast and cheap transactions on top of Bitcoin while maintaining security and privacy. Point-TimeLock Contracts (PTLCs) are seen as an improvement over Hash-TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs) in Lightning Network payments, as they enable payment de-correlation along routes, which improves privacy and protects against wormhole attacks. In addition, PTLCs allow for a variety of interesting applications such as stuckless payments, escrow contracts over Lightning, high/DLOG AMP, pay-for-signature, and atomic multi-payment setup among others.However, implementing PTLC-based lightning channels requires significant changes to the core channel state machine, HTLC scripts, on-chain HTLC handling and resolution, path finding algorithms, invoice changes, and onion blob processing. Despite this, developers have found a way to execute PTLCs on Bitcoin using 1p-ECDSA adaptor signatures. The Lightning Network community is encouraged to experiment with PTLCs before Taproot is available, which will enable the use of 2p-Schnorr adaptor signatures in Lightning channels.Payment Points is another new development in the Lightning Network that offers potential for improving multi-party payment setups. However, Payment Points require Taproot to be used, but 1p-ECDSA adaptor sigs can be used to execute PTLCs on Bitcoin today. To test and play with the plethora of PTLC-based proposals, some changes to existing nodes and a fork of at least one lightning implementation would be needed.The article also discusses the challenges associated with deploying Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) due to bootstrapping issues with oracles. Possible solutions to this include Coinbase's new price oracle for the ETH ecosystem and the Defiads project. Payment Points allow for more complex contracts to be built on top of Lightning, such as multi-payment setups, Discreet Log Contracts (DLC), and barrier escrows.Matheus Degiovani, the maintainer of Decred's port of lnd, expressed interest in Proof-of-Concepting PTLCs and invited anyone interested in details or spit-balling ideas for a prototype to contact him. He plans to provide an update once he has some minimal work done. Some changes will need to be made to existing nodes to support PTLCs, such as updating add_ptlc and commitment_signed functions. Dual deployment may be necessary as there is a risk that Schnorr will become available mid-development.The hope is to create a PTLC-based Lightning Network that is safe and stable as soon as possible, and further development and experimentation with PTLCs is encouraged ahead of Taproot's establishment. Nadav Kohen provides an update on replacing HTLCs with PTLCs and lists various benefits of using PTLCs for Lightning Network payments. However, he underestimates the degree of synchronization required to pull off the necessary changes to existing nodes. Implementing PTLC-based lightning channels may take longer than expected.</p>
