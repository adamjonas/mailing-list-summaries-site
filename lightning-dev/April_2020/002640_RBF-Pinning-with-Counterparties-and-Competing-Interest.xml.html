    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Protocol currently faces a severe issue with RBF Pinning HTLC Transactions, allowing a counterparty to steal funds. If B broadcasts the commitment transaction, C can spend an HTLC using preimage with a low-fee, RBF-disabled transaction. After a few blocks, A could claim the HTLC from B via the timeout mechanism, and then after a few days, C could get the HTLC-claiming transaction mined via some out-of-band agreement with a small miner. This leaves B short the HTLC value. One solution is to add a clause in OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to prevent C from making an RBF-disabled transaction. However, if the transaction is not in the mempool at all, the vulnerability is not about RBF or relay, but sheer economics.Before L+1, C has no incentive to bid because placing any bid leaks the preimage, which B can use to spend from A. Thus, B should ensure that *before* L+1, the HTLC-Timeout has been committed onchain, which prevents this bidding war from even starting. The issue then is that B is using a pre-signed HTLC-timeout, preventing B from RBF-ing the HTLC-Timeout transaction. Two solutions include adding an RBF carve-out output to HTLC-Timeout at the cost of more blockspace or using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` to make the C-side signature `SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_SINGLE`. With this, B can exponentially increase the fee as L+1 approaches.C can bribe a miner to prevent HTLC-Timeout from confirming between L and L+1, which is a censorship attack. To solve this, B can bump the fee on HTLC-Timeout, setting up a bidding war between C requesting miners to censor and B requesting miners to confirm. This only delays the war, and C will eventually want to start the bidding war.If both nodes support it, a Poon-Dryja channel can be upgraded without onchain activity to a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channel. Signed transactions spending the funding tx to a txo that has been set up as Decker-Russell-Osuntokun sidesteps the issue under discussion here.</p>
