    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the issue of low fee-rate transactions being difficult to evict from the Bitcoin mempool, creating a potential vulnerability for denial-of-service attacks. The post suggests that limiting the size of low-fee-rate transaction packages within the mempool could be a solution to this problem. However, it is noted that tightening acceptance rules may have unintended consequences, such as negatively impacting centralized wallet withdraws. An alternative proposal is presented which would allow transactors to mark their transactions as "likely-to-be-RBF'ed", enabling a relay policy where children of such transactions would be rejected unless the resulting package would be "near the top of the mempool". While this idea has its own drawbacks, it appears more in line with what the post author is looking for.</p>
