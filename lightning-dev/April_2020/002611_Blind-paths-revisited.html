    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion related to Lightning Network, there arises a concern about sender/receiver corruption and potential information leaks. The forwarding nodes are generally considered safe from attack and privacy is desired for the payment as a whole rather than individual parties. At present, the receiver doesn't know the sender node, but the exact receiver node must be known by the sender to make a route to it, which could lead to blockchain-layer shenanigans. A proposal to provide a partial, blinded path gives the receiver better privacy protection against the sender. Blinding factors in a decorrelated PTLC-based payment may be generated by the sender for path privacy, but the receiver can also provide blinding factors to a partial path without issue. The point that the sender targets at the first node in the receiver-provided partial route is no different from the final point it would have targeted if it knew exactly who the receiver was.</p>
