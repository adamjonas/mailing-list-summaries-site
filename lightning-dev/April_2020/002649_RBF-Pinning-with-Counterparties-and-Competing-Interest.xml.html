    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development discussion, ZmnSCPxj identified a severe issue in the current Lightning protocol. He explained that in today's Lightning protocol, a counterparty could steal funds by spending an HTLC using the preimage with a low-fee, RBF-disabled transaction if the commitment transaction was broadcasted. After a few blocks, the original sender of the HTLC could claim the HTLC from the receiver via the timeout mechanism, and then the initial receiver could get the HTLC-claiming transaction mined via some out-of-band agreement with a small miner, which would leave the intermediary party (the one who initially received the HTLC) short the HTLC value. ZmnSCPxj suggested that adding an "RBF-enabled" requirement to the `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` clause in the hashlock branch might be sufficient to prevent this attack. However, he also noted that adding children or parents that are not RBF-enabled could break this prevention method. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj pointed out that sheer economics, rather than RBF or relay, could cause vulnerabilities in the system. To prevent the issue, B should ensure that the HTLC-Timeout has been committed on-chain before the L+1 deadline. However, B is currently using a pre-signed HTLC-timeout, which prevents them from RBF-ing the HTLC-Timeout transaction. Therefore, ZmnSCPxj suggested allowing B to add fees to HTLC-Timeout by adding an RBF carve-out output or using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`. This would enable B to exponentially increase the fee as L+1 approaches and prevent C from stealing the HTLC value. However, this only delays the bidding war. C can still bribe a miner to censor the confirmation of HTLC-Timeout between L and L+1. Thus, letting B bump the fee on HTLC-Timeout is precisely the mechanism needed to set up a bidding war between C requesting miners to censor and B requesting miners to confirm. ZmnSCPxj also suggested that Decker-Russell-Osuntokun could sidestep this issue.</p>
