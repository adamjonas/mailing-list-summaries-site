    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the email, the sender mentioned that there is an expectation for the service to work properly. They also discussed the possibility of designing a payment system for the service, but expressed uncertainty about whether users would be willing to pay for it. The sender mentioned that the current free version of the service is likely more suitable for the majority of users.The sender also mentioned the importance of people being able to identify and report any issues with the service on social media. They explained that the code already includes a feature to handle cases where the server backup becomes stale, but they believe it would be beneficial to make this information visible to the user. Doing so would help identify and address any synchronization problems between the user's wallet and the wallet provider that may occur due to disconnections.However, the sender acknowledged that designing a proof for the user to share publicly without revealing private data or encryption keys is a challenging task. They thanked the recipient, Peter, for their input in the discussion.Please note that this summary is based on the limited information provided in the given context and may not capture all the details or nuances of the original email.</p>
