    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Vincent clarifies that he did not intend to suggest that Elias's points were incorrect. He apologizes if he gave the wrong impression. Vincent seeks clarification on Carla and Clara's proposal regarding the dry-run. The purpose of this algorithm is to test if the theory holds up in practice by selecting a few nodes to enable a specific feature and share data. Vincent assumes that only a few nodes are required due to the localized nature of reputation. Each node builds its own reputation. In summary, Vincent assumes that the dry-run will be conducted with selected nodes. Once they understand the direction to proceed, they can prioritize privacy and potentially expand data collection over time. Vincent agrees with Elias that they need to consider ways to protect the privacy of nodes and channels. Vincent mentions that their use case involves continuous data collection to track the evolution of the network for the XYZ feature. He acknowledges that reverse engineering is possible to reconstruct missing parts of the graph that a node might falsify. Vincent admits that he may not have explained himself clearly and apologizes for that. He believes that if they run this data collection for 4 to 5 months until their next analysis, the privacy concerns might seem overly complex. This is because they also need to trust the source of the data. Vincent agrees with Elias that they should communicate their goals, underlying purpose, and address any potential drawbacks.</p>
