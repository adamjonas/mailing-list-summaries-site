    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses two separate aspects: the additional medical risk/vaccination due to the selected geographical area, and the health coverage provided by the employer/insurer of the sender's country of origin. The first aspect is related to the careful selection of countries when traveling, as vaccinations may be required in some areas. The sender mentions that they have not had to get vaccinated for all the countries they have visited in Africa. The second aspect pertains to health coverage and applies to European visitors in the US or US visitors in certain European countries.The sender acknowledges that if the recipient does not wish to have developer meetings on the continent, they understand. They mention a past event in Zurich in 2020 where many Lightning developers were present, and progress was made on topics such as the initial Taproot integration list. They emphasize that no one is essential in Lightning development.The sender appreciates the recipient's feedback and considers it valuable due to their experience. They mention creating a Signal group with the recipient and themselves, and express their intention to consult other senior Lightning developers who may be interested in being part of the summit organizing committee.Overall, the email addresses the distinction between medical risks/vaccinations based on geographical area and health coverage from the employer/insurer. It also highlights the past event in Zurich and the importance of the recipient's feedback.</p>
