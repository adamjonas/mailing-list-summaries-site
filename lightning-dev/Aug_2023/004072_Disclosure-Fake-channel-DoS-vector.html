    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the email, Antoine Riard addresses the recipient's claim of having reviewed a large volume of pull requests in LDK. Antoine clarifies that the recipient has only reviewed a subset of code, mainly the anchors code, and highlights their involvement in other projects. Antoine mentions specific contributions made by the recipient in 2022 and 2023, including landing a PR to remove themselves from the security-reporting list, fixing a bug in the anchors aggregation, making constants public, and increasing a constant. Antoine also points out that the recipient has not participated in public LDK development calls, lightning spec meetings, or engaged in public discord discussions where development decisions are made. This lack of involvement suggests that the recipient may not have a deep understanding of all the project's aspects, making it inappropriate for them to speak on behalf of the project. Antoine acknowledges the recipient's contributions but emphasizes the importance of regular contribution for a comprehensive understanding of the project.Antoine disagrees with the recipient's assertion that lightning, as a protocol, does not take security seriously. He states that getting lightning right is challenging, considering the numerous ways it can go wrong. Antoine explains that the lightning software project, like others, takes security seriously while also striving to ship features that enhance lightning's usability and usefulness. Antoine suggests that if the recipient followed LDK and other lightning development more closely, they would have a greater appreciation for the complexities involved.Regarding the recipient's mention of "open-source ethical rules," Antoine expresses confusion and questions the notion of speaking for a project they don't closely follow. Antoine finds it strange that the recipient believes they should represent a project when they perceive the project's contributors as inadequate. Antoine concludes the email with uncertainty about the recipient's intentions and understanding of the situation, signing off as Matt.</p>
