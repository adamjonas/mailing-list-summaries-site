        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Vincent clarifies that he did not intend to suggest that Elias' points were incorrect and apologizes for any misunderstanding. He expresses his interest in understanding Carla and Clara's proposal for the dry-run and mentions that the algorithm will be implemented to test its practicality. Vincent assumes that only a few nodes will be needed for this task due to the localized nature of reputation. He summarizes that the dry-run will involve selected nodes and once the direction is clear, privacy can be prioritized and data collection can potentially be expanded.Elias responds to Vincent's emphasis on privacy, expressing confusion about the plan to collect data from real-world forwarding nodes rather than creating synthetic or research datasets. Elias explains that it is possible to re-identify node IDs and channels by correlating the dataset with publicly available data. He suggests using timestamps and datasets from neighboring nodes to determine which obfuscated clusters correspond to real-world clusters. Elias believes that sharing aggregated results and clearly communicating the framework and associated risks are important.Carla and Clara respond to Elias, acknowledging that only aggregated results will be shared as the default plan. They mention that timestamp fuzzing can obfuscate payment timing. However, Elias points out that resolution time deltas are relevant for timing-based inference. Elias raises concerns about privacy and suggests that certain fields should be faked to ensure reproducibility of research results while protecting privacy. He also emphasizes the importance of having real-world data for research purposes and cites examples of failed programs due to lack of real data.In response to Elias' concerns, Carla and Clara express their agreement on the importance of privacy. They mention limiting the collection period to six months to address data storage and access concerns. They propose establishing a common data format to provide local tooling for node operators and assure that best practices will be followed to handle sensitive information. Anonymization of fields will also be implemented.Elias acknowledges the importance of having real-world datasets but raises concerns about potential re-identification of anonymized channel counterparties. He suggests clarifying upfront whether there will be a time-boxed collection period and who will have access to the data. Elias emphasizes the need for trust in the researchers who will have access to the data.The team confirms their plan to conduct a "dry run" of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking. The purpose is to gather real-world data for validation and simulation. They outline the phases of the plan, including collecting anonymized forwarding data, propagating an experimental endorsement TLV, and implementing local reputation algorithms. They mention the involvement of multiple teams and address privacy concerns by proposing a common data format and randomizing certain fields when exporting data.Once the data collection code is in place, they will call for node operators to start collecting data and invite anyone interested in helping out to reach out.</p>
