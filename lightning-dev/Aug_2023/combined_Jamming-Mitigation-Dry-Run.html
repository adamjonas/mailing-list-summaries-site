        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Carla and Clara emphasize the importance of privacy-consciousness in their work. They aim to define a common data format that allows node operators to run local analysis without exporting the data. If users are comfortable sharing their data, best practices will be followed to handle the sensitive information securely, and the data will not be shared further. Timestamps can also be fuzzed to protect privacy. However, Elias raises concerns about re-identification of anonymized channel counterparties based on heuristics and combining datasets from multiple collection points. He requests clarification on the time period of data collection, storage location, and access permissions.The team plans to "dry run" HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking to better understand and mitigate jamming attacks. They have several goals, including using real-world data to check the behavior of local reputation algorithms, obtaining liquidity and slot utilization data, and providing a common data export format for analysis. The plan involves three phases: collecting anonymized forwarding data with a common format, propagating the experimental `endorsement` TLV, and implementing local reputation and setting endorsement values. Each team member is responsible for specific tasks related to these phases.To collect anonymized data, the team proposes a CSV file format with various fields, including channel IDs, peer pubkeys, fees, liquidity, timestamps, and endorsement status. Certain fields must be randomized when exported to researching teams to ensure privacy. Before adding endorsement signaling, the last two values indicating endorsement status will always be -1. The team also plans to propagate the experimental endorsement TLV in `update_add_htlc`, which should be set and propagated by forwarding nodes accordingly.The final step involves implementing local reputation algorithms and actively setting the value of the endorsement TLV for outgoing HTLCs. This signal will only be used for data collection purposes. Experimenters can use the full range of bits to express endorsement values, but non-zero values will be interpreted as positive endorsements. The team suggests that senders choose a probability value to set endorsed=1 for their payments. Once the data collection code is ready, node operators will be invited to start collecting data.Overall, Carla and Clara stress the need for privacy-consciousness in their work and assure users that best practices will be followed to handle sensitive information securely. The team's plan involves collecting anonymized data, propagating the experimental endorsement TLV, and implementing local reputation algorithms. They welcome questions and assistance from interested parties.</p>
