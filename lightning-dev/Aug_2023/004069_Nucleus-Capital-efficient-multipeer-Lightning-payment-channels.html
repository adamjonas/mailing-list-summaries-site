    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email is responding to someone named David who has read and analyzed their work. They acknowledge that the design of their proposal relies on the assumption of an honest majority, but disagree that this restricts its usability. They argue that many distributed system consensuses, including bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus, also rely on similar assumptions. They mention that even a smaller fraction of dishonest peers can disrupt consensus conditions in some cases.Regarding the proposed protocol, the author explains that the only aspect that requires an honest majority is the safety of funds received during operations when some peers are unresponsive. They believe this risk can be controlled by the peer and is just a different tradeoff compared to risks in existing lightning networks. They suggest that reputation systems or stake put by joining peers could mitigate these risks further, which could be explored in future protocol development.Addressing a second argument brought up by David, the author clarifies that non-voluntary exclusion only requires two transactions: current allocation and new funding. They claim that no other protocol offers a cheaper non-voluntary exclusion process in terms of transaction size. They also mention that their proposal can be combined with the idea of channel factories, where Nucleus channels can be created without an onchain footprint for non-voluntary exclusion.The author expresses gratitude for a reference to previous research by John Law, acknowledging that it takes a different approach with different tradeoffs compared to their proposed Nucleus protocol.Overall, the email highlights the author's defense of their proposal, explaining why they believe the reliance on an honest majority does not limit its usability and addressing points raised by David. They also discuss potential ways to mitigate risks and suggest combining their protocol with channel factory ideas.</p>
