    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the idea of hosting a Lightning Network (LN) summit in a more diverse set of countries, including on the African continent. However, the sender expresses skepticism about this idea. They mention that the usual LN summit is an invite-only developer meeting and hosting it in a country with additional travel requirements and limited direct international flights would not be beneficial. It would only add to the costs and inconvenience for attendees. The sender also expresses doubts about the organizer of the summit or conference, mentioning that they do not live in the city where it will be hosted. This raises concerns about their ability to effectively organize and manage the event.Overall, the email raises valid points about the practicality and feasibility of hosting a LN summit in a country with additional travel requirements and questions the credibility of the organizer.</p>
