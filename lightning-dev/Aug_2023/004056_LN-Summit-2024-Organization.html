    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses the proposal for the location of next year's June 2024 Lightning Network (LN) Summit. The sender has done research on various geographical areas in Africa, considering travel advisories, social situations, and the state of the local Bitcoin community. Based on this research, they propose Ghana as the location for the summit. They mention that Ghana has previously hosted the Afro Bitcoin Conference and will do so again in December of this year.To ensure smooth preparation for the summit, the sender plans to attend this year's conference in Ghana to familiarize themselves with the ground. They also suggest Morocco or Algeria as backup options due to their French-speaking communities, or South Africa, although it poses logistic challenges due to its distance. It is noted that a visa will be required for Schengen, US, and Commonwealth passport holders, but ECOWAS passport holders may be exempted.The sender offers to cover the hard logistical cost of the LN Summit 2024 out of their own pocket. They clarify that the LN Summit is an invitation-only event reserved for Lightning developers and researchers. They emphasize that it should not be confused with the Lightning conference organized by Fulmo. The sender suggests the possibility of organizing a co-event with Qala Africa and mentions being in touch with some individuals there. However, they clarify that they will only take personal accountability for the LN Summit and not any other satellite events.In conclusion, the sender believes it is wise to plan ahead and start small for the first protocol dev event, including CoreDev.</p>
