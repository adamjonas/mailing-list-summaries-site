    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the email, the sender addresses a misconception regarding the permissionless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. They clarify that while the Bitcoin blockchain operates on a permissionless peer-to-peer layer where both miners and users are pseudonymous, the Lightning channel (including Nucleus) is a fully permissioned system. This means that no external participant can join the Lightning channel without the agreement of all participants involved.The sender emphasizes that this permissioned system provides a higher level of protection against Sybil attacks, which are attacks where a malicious actor creates multiple identities to gain control or influence over a network. They mention that mechanisms such as reputation can be used to ensure the inclusion of trustworthy participants in the Lightning channel.It is important to note that in the case of Bitcoin, participants do not need authorization from each other. However, in the case of Lightning channels, participants must authorize each other.Overall, the email clarifies the distinction between the permissionless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and the permissioned nature of the Lightning channel, highlighting the benefits of the latter in terms of security against Sybil attacks.</p>
