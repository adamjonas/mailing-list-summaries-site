    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email raises concerns about the collection of data and suggests that using real-world forwarding nodes would be more beneficial than creating synthetic/research datasets. The author mentions that obfuscating certain fields does not prevent re-identification of node ids and channels using publicly available data. They propose using a long collection period to approximate the number of channels each observation point has with its neighbors, which could help identify obfuscated node ids. The author suggests using timestamps to exclude nodes/channels that couldn't have been used at the time the HTLC was sent and leveraging datasets from neighboring nodes to determine which anonymized clusters correspond to real-world clusters. By re-identifying nodes, they believe it would be possible to derive HTLC amounts from gathered fees and draw conclusions about liquidities. Additionally, they mention that the HTLC resolution time delta could provide insights into the network distance of the HTLC destination. The author acknowledges that these are estimations and suggests fuzzing the timestamps to make it harder for adversaries. They express familiarity with conducting Lightning research without real-world data sets and recommend sharing aggregated results and clearly communicating the framework and associated risks to node operators considering sharing their data.</p>
