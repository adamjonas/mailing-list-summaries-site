    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email from Antoine discusses the concern about additional travel requirements for a summit on the African continent. Antoine acknowledges the concern but argues that holding the summit in Africa would result in less accumulated travel time compared to previous destinations like Tokyo and Adelaide. Antoine provides links to visa requirements for French, US, and UK passport holders. He mentions that visa-free countries for all three passports include Morocco, Senegal, Cameroon, and South Africa, with some already visited. However, he excludes Algeria due to its strong Bitcoin local community. Antoine explains that scheduling the summit well-ahead allows for buffer time to manage the complexity of additional operational requirements. Regarding the organization of the Zurich 2020 event, Antoine mentions that none of the members of the organizing committee were living in Zurich. However, there were Swiss members, which is beneficial for the organization. Antoine mentions being in touch with local Bitcoiners from various countries.In conclusion, Antoine invites Lightning developers interested in contributing to the organization of next year's summit to reach out. He plans to start a summit organization Signal group and includes Matt, who has experience with open-source events and strong opinions.</p>
