        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Antoine acknowledges that it is unusual to announce the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels but believes that announcing it early is necessary due to potential complexities such as visa travels and tropical weather.To ensure fairness and transparency, Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach for the summit's organization. He welcomes objections or feedback regarding his involvement and emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability in the open-source community.To begin the project, Antoine proposes surveying countries with reasonable operational stability, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the best location for the summit. He plans to privately share the survey results with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He encourages Lightning Network developers to participate and views it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes by mentioning his experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the upcoming LN Summit.</p>
