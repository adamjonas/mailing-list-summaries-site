        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, a proposal is made to host a Lightning Network (LN) summit in Africa in June 2024. The sender believes that Africa would be a suitable location due to its cultural richness, historical significance, fragmented financial systems, and the presence of a growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. The proposal suggests conducting a survey of countries with operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the best location for the summit.The sender acknowledges that it is unusual to announce the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, but they believe that announcing it well in advance is necessary due to potential complexities, including visa requirements and tropical weather. They emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in the open-source community.To facilitate communication, a dedicated email address has been set up for interested participants to contribute to the organization of the summit. The sender encourages Lightning Network developers to get involved, considering it an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. The sender also mentions previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides them with operational templates for the upcoming summit.Overall, the email presents a proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa, highlighting the continent's potential and the need for collaboration and inclusivity in organizing the event.</p>
