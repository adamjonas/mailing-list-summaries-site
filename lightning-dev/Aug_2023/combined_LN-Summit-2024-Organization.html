        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic population, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Antoine acknowledges that it is unusual to announce the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels. However, given the potential complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he believes it is better to announce the summit far ahead. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine welcomes any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the best location for the summit. The results will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 and invites LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, considering it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.He also mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa highlights the continent's potential and the need for collaboration and inclusivity in organizing the event.</p>
