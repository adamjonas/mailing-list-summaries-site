    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bastien is being informed that the sender's proposal, which involves new opcodes, is more of a theoretical discussion than a concrete proposal. The sender questions how the fraud proofs they described are more dangerous than revoked states and clarifies that there is no "toxic data" involved. The server is not supposed to sign certain pairs of values. The sender mentions a BOLT PR that was created for these issues and expresses surprise that Bastien did not mention it. The sender apologizes for forgetting about the PR but suggests that it could benefit from their idea of sending backup data as new fields in existing messages. They believe using existing messages would be more elegant and highlights that in practice, the client would only need to send their signature of the backup, not the backup itself. The sender concludes with "cheers" and signs their name as Thomas.</p>
