    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the message, Elias acknowledges the importance of having real-world datasets for conducting simulations and experiments on Lightning. However, he raises a concern about the potential re-identification of anonymized channel counterparties when collecting long-term data. He suggests that combining datasets from multiple collection points could lead to heuristic correlations with public graph data, potentially revealing the identities of counterparties. This could also provide insights into transferred amounts, channel liquidities, and even payment destination identities.To address this issue, Elias emphasizes the need for trust in the researchers who would have access to this data. He suggests that it would be helpful and best practice to clarify upfront whether there will be a time-boxed collection period, where the data would be stored, and who would have access to it. He believes that clearly defining the collection period is essential to avoid incentivizing node operators to collect and store HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contract) data for an extended period, especially with such a high level of detail.Overall, Elias highlights the importance of considering privacy concerns and establishing clear guidelines for data collection in order to maintain trust and ethical practices in the research process.</p>
