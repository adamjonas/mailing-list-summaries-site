    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The latest release of software is equipped with a feature that enables it to restart, and reconnect without losing any information. It also has simple routing. The "accept-payment" and "pay" JSON commands have been added. However, the channel setup in this version is still basic. Public nodes will be set up on testnet soon, and detailed instructions will follow. The next version of the software will have IRC-based autodetect of nodes, which will be a more pleasant experience. This release includes many changes such as Shachain saving for receiver, inter-node encryption fix, add-route config option, support routing through of HTLCs, drop support for uncompressed keys, reconnect support with retransmission as required, database support to save state at important points, switch HTLCs to states, and various other minor fixes and cleanups. These changes were made to match the latest BOLT specifications.</p>
