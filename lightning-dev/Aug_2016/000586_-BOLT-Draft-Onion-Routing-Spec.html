    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion took place between Rusty Russell and Olaoluwa Osuntokun regarding the format of "onion blob" header. Osuntokun proposed that the next-hop address field should just be an opaque blob with no further explicit meaning, as nodes residing on various chains will parse the address accordingly. Russell agreed partially but stated that there is a need for some identifier to know, as nodes may straddle chains. They also discussed the addition of a realm byte to prevent ambiguity in transferring funds where multiple channels are being used on different chains using the same identifiers between two nodes. Russell suggested storing it in the per-hop payload, along with the instructions for the hop. They also talked about not allocating an additional byte for the terminal node, as the terminal node can either be identified by the null-MAC or null-nexthop, and the last hop's routing information is all zeroes.</p>
