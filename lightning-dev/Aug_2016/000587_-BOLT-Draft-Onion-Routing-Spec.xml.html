    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, the developers are discussing the complexity of the routing protocol for onion packets. Rusty Russell suggests that it is unnecessary to implement a complex routing protocol and suggests a rendezvous node instead. Olaoluwa Osuntokun realizes that the hop after the rendezvous node is hidden from the pre-rendezvous node due to onion encryption. They agree to keep the protocol simple and support regular nodes, with nodes broadcasting what extensions they support. Christian Decker points out that it would be ideal to seamlessly integrate rendezvous routing and suggests a scheme that merges the two ends of the route in a seamless way. The group also discusses the need for key rotation and shared secret storage, with daily key rotation being sufficient and timestamped logs of secrets being unnecessary. They conclude that key rotation alone should suffice. Overall, they are working towards a clean and simple solution to these issues.</p>
