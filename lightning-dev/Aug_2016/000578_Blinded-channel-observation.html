    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Joseph Poon and Rusty Russell discuss the use of revocation keys in relation to shachain/elkrem. Tadge Dryja's method uses a revocation key and is compatible with shachain/elkrem, but omits hashing in the commit script and uses only signature verification. Poon claims to have come up with the general construction for this method a long time ago, but Tadge was the first to implement it. The property that Rusty hoped for was the ability for Alice and Bob to independently predict each others' future revocation hashes/pubkeys, allowing an arbitrary number of commitment transactions in flight each way at once. Poon suggests that instead of predicting each other's future revocation hashes/pubkeys, it's possible to revoke as part of giving the next revocation hash/pubkey, which may save bandwidth. However, this method may add complexity without significant gains, so they decide to stick with hash trees.</p>
