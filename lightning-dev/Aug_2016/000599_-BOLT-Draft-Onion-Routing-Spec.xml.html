    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Joseph Poon and Rusty Russel discussed the issue of guesswork in transferring cryptocurrencies. They agreed that there should be a requirement for the amount to be pre-negotiated by the sender and recipient to avoid errors, which could lead to theft by prior hops. Rusty Russell suggested implementing code to steal such re-sends or fail them, while Joseph Poon said either way seemed practical for some nodes. He also noted that consistent hashes were necessary to prevent creation of a new onion blob presuming that the second-to-last hop was malicious.</p>
