    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the participants discuss the implementation of a miniscript-like language for lightning network transactions. They explore various ideas, including revealing proof of knowledge rather than scalars and using pay-for-signature to reveal Schnorr signatures. The conversation also touches upon the use of economically-rational atomicity and computationally-intractable security in barrier escrows. The concept of a Barrier Escrow as a Service is also discussed, with the suggestion that there may be a need for a standard communication interface. Finally, the participants outline a High AMP protocol with rules for the receiver, such that only when the receiver acquires all branches as incoming payments will it be able to reconstruct the secret `z` and thereby claim its payment. The protocol is detailed step by step, with each participant learning the necessary secrets to claim their part of the transaction.</p>
