    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses two main categories of mempool issues related to the OP_SECURETHEBAG feature - relay cost and mempool walking. The first issue can be fixed by assessing Replace By Fee update fees appropriately. However, there are some tricky edge cases that make it non-obvious to do so. The second issue is related to the algorithms used in the mempool, which can be N log N or N^2 in the number of descendants. An opened PR should help with some of the walking issues by allowing for cheap caching to avoid re-expanding a node.OP_SECURETHEBAG is designed to allow an unlimited number of child transactions, unlike lightning htlcs. This feature puts all HTLCS into a tree where they are individualized leaf nodes with a preceding CSV. To ensure each HTLC has time to close properly, the above fix would ensure each HTLC always has individualized lockpoints. The discussion also includes a proposal to relax the current carve-out rule to avoid adding a 1 CSV to all outputs, which causes HTLC scripts to change. Instead, it is suggested to let the last transaction added to a package of dependent transactions in the mempool have no more than one unconfirmed parent. This would allow an attacker to exceed the MAX_PACKAGE_VIRTUAL_SIZE limit in some cases, but it's not clear if this is a problem with the current mempool acceptance code in bitcoind.</p>
