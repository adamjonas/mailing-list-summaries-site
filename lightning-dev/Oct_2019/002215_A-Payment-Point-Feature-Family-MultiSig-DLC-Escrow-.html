    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the implementation of a High AMP (Atomic Multipath Payments) protocol that involves the use of economically-rational and computationally-intractable security. The goal is to ensure that the receiver only reveals secrets upon receiving multiple payments that sum up to the price of its service or product. However, it is noted that an economically-rational actor may accept a single payment that exceeds the price and subvert the barrier escrow E. To address this issue, the High AMP protocol is upgraded with computationally-intractable security that utilizes points and scalars. The new protocol involves the generation of additional keypairs and the creation of rules for the receiver. The protocol is broken down into steps involving premium payment, swapping of assets, and revelation of secrets. Ultimately, the protocol ensures that the receiver can only claim payment once all incoming payments sum up to the price of its service or product.</p>
