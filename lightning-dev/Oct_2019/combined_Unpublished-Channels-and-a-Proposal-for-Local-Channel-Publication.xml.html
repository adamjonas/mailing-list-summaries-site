        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network protocol mailing list, has proposed a new method for nodes to share information about unpublished channels. The current system allows one node to ask another if it can reveal information about a shared channel to friends of the asking node. However, the new proposal suggests that nodes could whisper to each other about unpublished channels they have with other nodes, which would allow them to break the Axiom of Terminus and share information about unpublished channels more widely.The article further explains the Axiom of Terminus and how it can affect payment analysis on the Lightning Network. It highlights how entities controlling large amounts of Bitcoin can closely monitor participants in the network, especially if they have significant numbers of unpublished channels. To mitigate this risk, the proposal suggests ways to break the axiom of terminus, such as local publication.The proposal also introduces new messages like the `request_local_unpublished_channels` and the `respond_local_unpublished_channels` that provide data about local unpublished channels. These messages can help create subnets on the Lightning Network via Channel Factory, which could behave much like a node composed of nodelets. The article discusses the tradeoffs between using channel factories and nodelets as well.Overall, the proposal aims to improve the sharing of information about unpublished channels among nodes on the Lightning Network while mitigating the risks associated with the Axiom of Terminus.</p>
