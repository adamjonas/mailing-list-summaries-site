    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The schnorr/taproot/tapscript BIPs are ready for review and the Bitcoin community is seeking a broad range of participants to examine them before implementation/deployment. However, reviewing the BIPs is difficult as there are not many individuals familiar with reviewing BIPs and many concepts to understand. Thus, a proposal for a structured review period has been suggested. Participants will be provided guidance/structure to go through the BIPs and describe any issues that require changes or provide an "ACK" that the drafts should move forward into implementation/deployment phases. The benefits of participating include deeply understanding schnorr and taproot, being a stakeholder in Bitcoin consensus development, supporting/safeguarding decentralization of Bitcoin protocol development, and having fun. Interested individuals can sign up here, and special thanks go to AJ Towns for leading the initiative.</p>
