    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The ElementsProject has announced a new release of its lightning network daemon, version 0.7.3, which includes support for different SQL backends and a PostgresSQL driver. Users can now supply a Bitcoin address to close a channel to, and new plugin notifications have been added. Encryption of the BIP32 master seed is also available, as well as UTXO selection for withdraw and txprepare. The Bolt11 tools now parse feature bits, and nodes can be excluded from route consideration in getroute. The deprecated RPC call listpayments has been removed. On the network side, lightningd supports L-BTC, and c-lightning nodes now announce features in node_announcement broadcasts. Feature bits have been consolidated and are now advertised in both global and local feature fields. Gossip_queries_ex is supported for finer grained gossip control, and gossip bandwidth usage has been tightened using peer rotation and limiting gossip queries. Initial_routing_sync is no longer requested. Since 0.7.2.1, there have been 522 commits from 18 different authors, including five first-time contributors. More details can be found in the release notes on GitHub.</p>
