    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11 to include bundled payments in Lightning invoices. This is aimed at addressing the needs of services like submarine swaps and JIT channels, which require prepayments for non-custodian exchanges. Currently, some services can handle prepayments while others cannot due to limitations in their wallet software. The proposal suggests that the receiver should wait for both the prepayment and main payment HTLCs to arrive before fulfilling the prepayment HTLC. If the main payment does not arrive, the prepayment should be failed with a MPP timeout. Once both payments are received, the receiver fulfills the prepayment HTLC and broadcasts the on-chain transaction.Voegtlin believes that implementing this change would create fair competition among lightning service providers. Currently, services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for prepayments because they use dedicated client software, while competitors without such software are vulnerable to mining fee attacks. ACINQ could also benefit from this change by making their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. There have been concerns about adding new features to BOLT-11, but Voegtlin argues that the proposal is a minimal change that does not require significant interactivity. He suggests making the feature optional during a transition period, with a new feature bit defined for bundle prepayment. The decision to make this feature required or optional would be up to the service provider.While some members express skepticism about introducing new changes to BOLT-11, Voegtlin believes there is an opportunity to add this feature. Major implementations like Lightning Labs and ACINQ may have an incentive to support the proposal, and other implementations like LDK and Electrum could also support it.In a mailing list post, ThomasV proposed a non-interactive approach for the Lightning Network's BOLT-11 protocol. He argued against using BOLT-12 or onion messages, stating that they unnecessarily complicate the process. Initial feedback suggested that BOLT-12 or OM could be used for this use case, but ThomasV remains firm in his belief that adding new messages is not necessary. The mailing list post was made on the Lightning-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation.</p>
