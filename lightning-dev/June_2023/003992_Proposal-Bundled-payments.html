    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin, the developer of Electrum, expressed interest in implementing support for BOLT-12, a proposed extension to the Lightning Network protocol. However, he suggested that bundled payments, a feature that allows for the prepayment of fees, could be implemented in BOLT-11 instead, potentially leading to faster adoption.Bastien TEINTURIER responded to Thomas, highlighting the importance of updating sender software for any proposal involving channel creation or splice on the receiver end. He outlined three strategies for providing just-in-time (JIT) liquidity and explained that the current network deployment uses strategies 1 and 2, which do not require additional action from senders. Bastien argued that solution 2, coupled with zero-conf transactions, could adequately address trust and regulation concerns, but acknowledged that pre-paying fees might be more suitable if zero-conf is no longer used.Matt Corallo joined the conversation, expressing doubt about the feasibility of introducing new changes to BOLT-11, given the challenges in getting existing features widely supported. He questioned the need for a new method of swaps and suggested exploring the use of Outbound Messaging (OMs) for enhanced privacy.In response, Thomas emphasized that his proposal for bundled payments was a small change and argued that technical decisions should be based on technical needs rather than assumptions about protocol ossification. He noted that Lightning Labs and ACINQ could potentially benefit from supporting this feature and encouraged its inclusion in BOLT-12.Thomas further elaborated on the benefits of bundled payments, citing specific use cases like submarine swaps and JIT channels. He explained how the current implementation poses vulnerabilities to DoS attacks and custodian services, and proposed bundling prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. This would create a level playing field for lightning service providers and help them comply with regulations.Overall, Thomas's suggestion aims to improve the lightning network's functionality and enhance competition among service providers, with potential benefits for Loop by Lightning Labs, ACINQ, and Electrum. The proposal is seen as a relatively small change that could be implemented in BOLT-11 or BOLT-12, depending on the decision of the service provider.In a mailing list thread, ThomasV proposed a non-interactive solution for the Lightning Network that does not require the exchange of new messages. He mentioned that his proposal does not involve using BOLT-12 or onion messages, as he believes this would unnecessarily complicate things. Some initial feedback suggested that BOLT-12 or OM could be used for this use case, but ThomasV argued against it. He emphasized the importance of avoiding the addition of new messages when a non-interactive approach can be implemented. The thread also included contact information for Electrum Technologies GmbH, including their address in Berlin, Germany, and relevant mailing list links.</p>
