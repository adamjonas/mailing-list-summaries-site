    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin expressed interest in implementing BOLT-12 support in Electrum. He asked for clarification on whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Thomas also mentioned his belief that it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning but thinks it could be deployed faster if adopted in BOLT-11 instead.Bastien TEINTURIER responded to Thomas, emphasizing the importance of updating sender software for the proposed channel creation or splice feature. They discussed three strategies for providing JIT liquidity and explained that the currently deployed methods do not require senders to be aware of JIT liquidity. Additionally, they mentioned the use of 0-conf and pre-paying fees as options for trust and regulation concerns.Thomas Voegtlin replied to Bastien's email, suggesting an extension to BOLT-11 where invoices can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. He explained that this feature would benefit services like submarine swaps and JIT channels, which require prepayment of mining fees. Thomas proposed including this new feature in BOLT-12, as all implementations are actively working on it. He provided a detailed description of how bundled payments would work and emphasized the potential benefits for Lightning service providers.Matt Corallo joined the conversation, expressing skepticism about the possibility of adding new changes to BOLT-11 at this point. He mentioned the difficulty of getting broad support for amount-less BOLT-11 invoices and suggested exploring the use of splice-out and onion messages for swaps.In summary, the email exchange discusses the proposal to add bundled payments to BOLT-11 invoices, the implications for sender software, the strategies for JIT liquidity, and the opinions of different participants regarding the adoption and implementation of the proposed changes.In a recent post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ThomasV, the CEO of Electrum Technologies GmbH, proposed a solution for a use case that does not require the exchange of new messages. The proposal, named BOLT-11, suggests a non-interactive approach instead of using BOLT-12 or onion messages as it believes adding new messages would unnecessarily complicate the process.ThomasV's proposal received initial feedback suggesting the use of BOLT-12 or OM. However, he argues that this approach is unnecessary and prefers a non-interactive method. By avoiding the exchange of new messages, the proposed solution aims to streamline the process and make it more efficient.Electrum Technologies GmbH, based in Berlin, Germany, is a technology company specializing in Lightning Network development. The company's CEO, Thomas Voegtlin, has been actively involved in the Lightning-dev community.The Lightning-dev mailing list is a platform where developers discuss and collaborate on Lightning Network-related topics. It provides a space for sharing ideas, proposing solutions, and seeking feedback from the community.Overall, ThomasV's proposal suggests an alternative approach, BOLT-11, for addressing a specific use case without the need for additional messages. This proposal aims to simplify the process and enhance the efficiency of Lightning Network transactions.</p>
