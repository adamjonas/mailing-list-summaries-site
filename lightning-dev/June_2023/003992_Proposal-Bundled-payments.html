    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin expressed interest in implementing BOLT-12 support in Electrum. He asked if bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Thomas also believed that it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning, but if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.Bastien TEINTURIER responded to Thomas, emphasizing the importance of the proposal requiring senders to be aware of channel creation or splice on the receiver's end. Bastien suggested extending BOLT-12 instead of updating BOLT-11 since new sender code is needed. He outlined three strategies for providing JIT liquidity and explained the advantages of currently deployed strategies 1) and 2), as they do not require senders to be aware of JIT liquidity. Bastien also mentioned that if trust and regulation are a concern, solution 2) works well when coupled with 0-conf, but pre-paying fees would be more reasonable if 0-conf is no longer used.Thomas replied, stating that he believes it is not too late to add a new feature to BOLT-11 and that technical decisions should be based on technical needs. He suggested that Lightning Labs and ACINQ, two major implementations, would have an incentive to support the proposed change. Thomas also highlighted the importance of this feature for ACINQ to comply with upcoming MICA regulations. He proposed a new invoice feature that describes the prepayment of a fee using a different preimage and suggested making this feature optional during a transition period.Matt Corallo expressed doubt about getting any new interoperable change into BOLT-11, given the lack of broad support for amount-less BOLT-11 invoices. He questioned the need for the proposed change in relation to splice-out and suggested building it on OMs for more privacy.In a separate email, Thomas proposed an extension to BOLT-11 where an invoice can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. He explained that this would address the need for prepayment of mining fees in services like submarine swaps and JIT channels. Thomas outlined the semantics of bundled payments and mentioned the potential benefits for lightning service providers and ACINQ's pay-to-open service in complying with regulations.Overall, Thomas Voegtlin is interested in implementing BOLT-12 support in Electrum and has proposed an extension to BOLT-11 to address the need for bundled payments. Bastien TEINTURIER suggests extending BOLT-12 instead of updating BOLT-11, while Matt Corallo expresses doubts about getting new changes into BOLT-11.In a recent post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ThomasV proposed a non-interactive way to handle use cases without the need for new messages. He believes that using BOLT-12 or onion messages would unnecessarily complicate things. Instead, ThomasV suggests using BOLT-11 and avoiding the exchange of new messages altogether.ThomasV received initial feedback suggesting that his use case could be addressed using BOLT-12 or OM (onion messages). However, he remains firm in his belief that adding new messages is unnecessary when there is a non-interactive solution available.The post was made on behalf of Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany. The company's details, including its address and registration information, were provided at the end of the post.To participate in the Lightning-dev mailing list or access further information, interested individuals can visit the provided link to the mailing list's webpage.</p>
