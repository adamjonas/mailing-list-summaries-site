    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Good morning everyone,I have a proposal to extend BOLT-11, which would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This extension is particularly useful for services that require prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels.In both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) for which they do not have the preimage. They must send funds on-chain and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when claiming the payment. Due to the uncertainty of whether the client will actually claim the payment, service providers often ask for prepayment of mining fees.Submarine swaps, which use dedicated client software like Loop by Lightning Labs, can handle this prepayment. However, competitors like Boltz exchange, which require a dedicated wallet, cannot easily implement this feature. As a result, Boltz is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees.JIT channels also face similar challenges. Providers who want to protect themselves against mining fee attacks may ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. This, however, makes them custodians of the funds, subject to legal regulations like the European MICA regulation. Competitors like Electrum, who refuse to offer custodian services, are excluded from this game.To address these issues, I propose bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments are as follows: the invoice contains two preimages and two amounts, and the receiver must wait until all HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment fails to arrive, the prepayment should be failed with a MPP (Multi-Path Payments) timeout. Once both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts the on-chain transaction. It's important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage.While this proposal does not prevent service providers from stealing the prepayment, it levels the playing field for competition between lightning service providers. Currently, Loop requires a dedicated client, leaving competitors without an established user base exposed to mining fee attacks. ACINQ would also benefit from this change, as it would enable them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. The current pay-to-open service used by Phoenix may fall under the scope of the European MICA regulation, which should be considered a serious issue.I believe that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be done in a non-interactive way, avoiding unnecessary complications.Thank you all for your attention.Best regards,ThomasV</p>
