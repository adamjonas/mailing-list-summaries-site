    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange in question took place on a mailing list for Lightning developers hosted by the Linux Foundation. In it, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow for two bundled payments in a single invoice. This feature would address issues that arise from submarine swaps and JIT channels, where service providers are required to ask prepayment of mining fees because they cannot guarantee that the user will claim the payment.The proposed extension would level the field of competition between lightning service providers. The bundled payments feature allows for a prepayment and main payment to be made in one invoice, with the receiver waiting until HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. However, the proposal requires senders to understand the new fields.Bastien Teinturier suggested that extending Bolt 12 may make more sense as it requires new sender code anyway, while Thomas believes that it could be implemented in BOLT-11 without adding new messages. The email signature at the end of the thread shows that it was sent by Electrum Technologies GmbH, located in Berlin, Germany and led by Geschäftsführer Thomas Voegtlin. The email provides information about the company's registration details, including its seat and Registergericht (registry court) which is responsible for registering companies in Germany. Overall, the context highlights how meticulous and detail-oriented businesses and developers can be when it comes to providing information and ensuring transparency in their operations. It also shows the importance of communication and collaboration within the developer community, as evidenced by the use of the mailing list to share updates and discuss ideas related to Lightning development.</p>
