    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread from the Lightning-dev mailing list hosted on lists.linuxfoundation.org discussed a proposal by Thomas Voegtlin to extend BOLT-11. The proposed extension would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts, making it easier for services like submarine swaps and JIT channels that require prepayment of mining fees. Currently, some service providers are vulnerable to DoS attacks or become custodians to protect themselves against such attacks.Bastien TEINTURIER suggested that extending Bolt 12 makes more sense than updating Bolt 11. He also mentioned three strategies to provide JIT liquidity. However, Thomas believes that the proposal is a tiny change that would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers, make pay-to-open service fully non-custodian, and have an impact on the shape of the ecosystem. The proposal requires senders to be aware of the new fields. Thomas suggests implementing the change in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages since it does not require the exchange of new messages. The email also includes contact information for Electrum Technologies GmbH, a Berlin-based company specializing in blockchain technology. The email mentions that Thomas Voegtlin is the company's Geschäftsführer or managing director, and lists their business registration and legal information, including their registry number and district court.</p>
