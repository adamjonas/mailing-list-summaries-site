        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine mentioned several reasons for choosing Africa as the location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, the fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, the growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledged that announcing the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels is usually avoided to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolls or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential complexities of operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine suggested announcing the summit far ahead. He also emphasized the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.To start the planning process, Antoine proposed surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could host the summit. Some of the countries mentioned include Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and more. Antoine mentioned that he will look into these countries and share feedback privately with the Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He encouraged Lightning Network developers to reach out and seize the opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.The email thread also included a response from nully0x, who commended Antoine's proposal and suggested connecting with existing Bitcoin and Lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries.Overall, the proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback, and steps are being taken to connect with local communities and gather feedback to ensure a successful event.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17, marks the end of a series of discussions and updates related to the development of the Lightning Network. The discussions took place on the mailing list managed by the Linux Foundation. The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of blockchain technology and aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions for cryptocurrencies. The mailing list serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to exchange ideas and contribute to the development of this network.</p>
