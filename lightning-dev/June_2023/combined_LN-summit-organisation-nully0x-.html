        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, the need for a compatible payment protocol to address financial system fragmentation, and the growing number of Lightning developers in the continent. Antoine emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the organization process and expressed his willingness to consider feedback and objections from the community.To kickstart the planning process, Antoine suggested surveying countries with operational stability that could potentially host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He also mentioned the existence of local Bitcoin and lightning network meetups in various African countries, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities. Antoine recommended connecting with these communities to gather insights and support for the event.Nully0x, another participant in the email thread, commended Antoine's proposal and agreed that reaching out to existing African Bitcoin communities would be a good initial step. Nully0x offered to connect privately to discuss further. Overall, the idea of hosting the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback, and Antoine's call for collaboration and input from Lightning developers was well-received. The next steps involve surveying potential host countries and engaging senior Lightning developers to address any visa or travel issues. Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this project (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) and encouraged interested developers to reach out and contribute to the organization of the summit.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has come to an end.
