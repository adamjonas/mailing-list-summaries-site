        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in financial systems, an increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to grow. To ensure smooth operations and address challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing the event well in advance. He also advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the planning process. Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to gather feedback from Lightning attendees privately.It would be beneficial to connect with existing Bitcoin and Lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, to bootstrap the planning process. These communities organize local meetups focused on technical sessions and can provide valuable insights and support. Antoine's proposal has received positive feedback from the lightning dev community, with nully0x expressing interest in supporting the initiative.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has concluded.
