        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and growing number of Lightning developers. However, organizing the event in Africa poses some operational challenges, such as visa travels and tropical weather.To ensure fairness and transparency, Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach with input from various individuals. To start the planning process, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will gather feedback from Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose.In addition, there are existing Bitcoin and Lightning network communities across Africa, including Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. It is suggested to connect with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process. Nully0x, another member of the Lightning community, supports Antoine's proposal and suggests reaching out privately to these communities. This collaboration could provide a good opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Overall, the proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa has received positive feedback from the Lightning-dev community.The Lightning-dev Digest, Volume 94, Issue 17, has concluded on the mailing list of foundation.org. This platform serves as a hub for discussions related to lightning development within the Linux Foundation.
