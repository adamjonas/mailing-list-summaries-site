        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, growing number of Lightning developers, and potential for local Lightning economies. Usually, the organization of such events is not announced publicly, but given the potential challenges of visas and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing it ahead of time. He also encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.To start the planning process, Antoine plans to survey countries with operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He has created a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose. Antoine invites other Lightning developers to get involved in the organization of the summit, as it provides an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has come to an end.
