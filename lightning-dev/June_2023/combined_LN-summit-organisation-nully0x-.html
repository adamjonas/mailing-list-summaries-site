        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are many reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and the growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. However, due to potential operational challenges such as visa troubles and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing the summit well in advance. He also emphasizes the importance of transparency and fairness in the organization process, suggesting a multi-stakeholder approach.Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with the Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the summit at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.It is noted that different communities across Africa already organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. Antoine suggests connecting with these communities first to bootstrap planning for the LN Summit. Overall, Antoine's proposal has received positive feedback from the lightning dev community, with nully0x expressing support and suggesting reaching out to these communities as a good first step.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17, was posted on the foundation.org website.
