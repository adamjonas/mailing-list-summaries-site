        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Dev community has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. The proposal highlights the reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its cultural and historical significance, the need for a compatible payment protocol to address financial system fragmentation, and the growing number of Lightning developers in the continent. The proposal also acknowledges the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, and emphasizes the importance of transparency and fairness in the organizational process.To start the planning process, the proposal suggests surveying countries with operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. Additionally, there are existing Bitcoin and Lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, which can be connected with to facilitate the planning process. The proposal encourages Lightning developers to get involved in the organization and highlights the opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Overall, the proposal seeks to gather feedback and ensure a successful and inclusive LN Summit in Africa.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has come to an end. This digest is related to the development of Lightning Network, a second layer protocol on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions. The digest provides a platform for developers and enthusiasts to discuss and share their ideas and progress regarding the Lightning Network.One of the links provided in the context is to the mailing list of lightning-dev, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. This mailing list serves as a forum for discussions and collaboration among developers working on Lightning Network implementations. It allows them to exchange ideas, ask questions, and share updates on their projects.The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that supports the growth of open-source software projects. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to work together and create innovative solutions. Their mailing list for lightning-dev is one such platform where developers can contribute to the advancement of Lightning Network technology.The Lightning Network is designed to address the scalability issues faced by the Bitcoin blockchain. By creating a network of payment channels off-chain, it enables faster and more cost-effective transactions. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we transact with cryptocurrencies, making them more practical for everyday use.In conclusion, the Lightning-dev Digest provides a valuable resource for developers and enthusiasts interested in the development of Lightning Network. It serves as a platform for collaboration and discussion, allowing participants to exchange ideas and share progress on their projects. With the support of organizations like the Linux Foundation, the development of Lightning Network technology continues to advance, offering promising solutions to the scalability challenges of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
