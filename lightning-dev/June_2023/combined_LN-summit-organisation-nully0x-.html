        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. This proposal stems from the belief that holding the summit in Africa would have numerous benefits. These include showcasing the continent's rich cultural and historical background, addressing fragmentation in financial systems through a compatible payment protocol, and fostering growth in local Lightning economies. Typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing the event well in advance. The operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, but a multi-stakeholder approach is encouraged to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.To begin planning, Antoine proposes surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the event, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me for anyone interested in being part of the organization. This presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Connecting with various communities across Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, who already organize local meetups focused on technical sessions about Bitcoin and the lightning network, is considered a good step in the planning process.Overall, Antoine seeks feedback and objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability. He previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for this endeavor. In response to Antoine's proposal, nully0x expresses support and suggests reaching out to the African Bitcoin communities for further collaboration.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has come to an end. This mailing list is hosted by the Linux Foundation and serves as a platform for developers working on the Lightning Network protocol. The Lightning Network is a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin that aims to improve transaction speed and reduce fees. It enables off-chain transactions through payment channels, allowing users to make multiple transactions without broadcasting them to the blockchain. The Lightning Network has gained significant attention due to scalability issues in Bitcoin, and it has the potential to make Bitcoin more practical for everyday use by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Additionally, it allows for micropayments, opening up new possibilities for content creators and online services.The lightning-dev mailing list provides a forum for developers to discuss technical aspects of the Lightning Network protocol. It facilitates the sharing of ideas, asking questions, and collaboration on development efforts. Anyone interested in contributing to the advancement of the Lightning Network can join the mailing list through the provided link. The Linux Foundation hosts this mailing list as part of its mission to support open-source software development. By providing a neutral and collaborative environment, the Linux Foundation promotes communication and cooperation among Lightning Network developers.In conclusion, the Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has concluded its discussions on the lightning-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. This mailing list serves as a platform for developers working on the Lightning Network protocol to collaborate and share ideas. The Lightning Network is a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin that aims to improve transaction speed and reduce fees.
