        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that holding the summit in Africa would be beneficial due to the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine acknowledges that announcing the organization of the summit on open communication channels is not the usual practice to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolls or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, he believes it is better to announce it ahead of time.Antoine plans to adopt a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the organization of the LN Summit. He requests objections to his contribution and assures the community that he will uphold strong transparency and accountability standards. He intends to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. Feedback gathered from these surveys will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.To facilitate communication and collaboration, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers interested in being part of the organization to reach out to contribute and facilitate knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Additionally, Antoine suggests connecting with existing Bitcoin and Lightning Network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, which organize local meetups focused on technical sessions. By leveraging these communities, Antoine aims to bootstrap planning for the LN Summit and foster collaboration among Lightning developers in Africa.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together the lightning dev community and leverage the potential of Africa for the LN Summit 2024. With the continent's unique cultural heritage, fragmented financial systems, and increasing number of Lightning developers, organizing the summit in Africa could contribute to the growth of local Lightning economies and foster knowledge exchange among contributors.</p>
