    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On 20th June 2023, Thomas Voegtlin, the founder of Electrum, commented on the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. He asked whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. The response was that while they won't work as specified, reusable BOLT12 offers mean that two payments could be sent from a single offer if the sender implements it. Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months.The conversation then turned to how long it would take for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. It was agreed that it would take years after merging. However, if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster. BOLT-12 has some way to go in terms of getting off the ground floor, but a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from zero, which could be a challenge.The proposal is to level the competition field between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. A dedicated client would still be required to verify the redeem script and invoice and sweep the funds. The value of the proposal has been questioned, as it only makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet they want to use distinct from their lightning wallet and their lightning wallet doesn't support splice-out, which most will in a year or so.</p>
