    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 20, 2023, Thomas Voegtlin discussed with Matt about the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. Matt enquired if bundled payments would work with the current specification or if they would require changes to BOLT-12, to which Thomas replied that while they will not work as-specified, a single offer can be scanned and two payments can be sent as long as the sender implements it. Thomas expressed his willingness to assist in implementing BOLT-12 support in Electrum. He also stated that even after being merged, BOLT-12 will take years to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. Matt was not sure why BOLT-11 extension could be deployed faster than BOLT-12. He stated that with BOLT-12, a swap-aware client can be used to scan one QR code and avoid any complicated dance. The goal of Thomas's proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet. However, a dedicated client is still required to verify the redeem script and invoice and sweep the funds. Matt expressed his struggle to see the value in this proposal as the user must have a swap-aware client for setup and enforcement, but any lightning wallet can pay for it. This proposal makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet that is distinct from their lightning wallet. However, this seems like quite a narrow set of requirements to him.</p>
