        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. There are several reasons why Africa is a suitable location for the summit, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and a growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. Antoine acknowledges the operational challenges involved in organizing an event in Africa, such as visa travels and "tropical weather," but believes that announcing it far ahead will help address these issues.Antoine emphasizes the importance of fairness and transparency in the organization process and suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure these principles. He invites feedback and objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024 and promises to maintain strong transparency and accountability standards. Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, and encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which gives him operational templates to work with.Bernard expresses interest in Antoine's proposal and indicates that he will reach out.</p>
