        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. In the past, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events has not been announced on open communication channels to maintain a focus on engineering conversation and avoid trolls or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather," it is advantageous to announce the event well in advance. While operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, a multi-stakeholder approach is preferred to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine welcomes feedback on his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024, encouraging individuals to express any objections publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards and highlights that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine suggests surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could accommodate the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He plans to privately share the feedback gathered based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.A dedicated communication endpoint has been set up for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. Antoine also invites Lightning Network (LN) developers to join the organization, as this presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses interest in Antoine's proposal and indicates that he will reach out to discuss further.</p>
