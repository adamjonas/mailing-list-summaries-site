        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Antoine acknowledges the operational challenges involved in organizing the event, such as visa travels and tropical weather, but believes it is better to announce the summit far in advance to address these challenges [0]. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He encourages open communication and actions rather than mere talk. To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability in Africa, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, and privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.A dedicated communication endpoint has been set up for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. Antoine also invites Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He concludes by mentioning his previous experience in co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates [0].Bernard expresses his interest in Antoine's proposal and states that he will reach out.</p>
