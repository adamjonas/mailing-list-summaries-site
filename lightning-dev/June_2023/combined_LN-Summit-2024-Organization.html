        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its rich cultural and historical past, the fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that could be solved with a compatible payment protocol, the growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of such events is usually not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he believes it is best to announce the event well in advance. While he expects operations and financial resources to be sufficient, he suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine invites any objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.To facilitate communication about the summit, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He also encourages Lightning developers to reach out and participate in the organization, seeing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.In the past, Antoine has co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, giving him experience and operational templates for organizing such events.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 aims to leverage the continent's potential and address the unique challenges and opportunities present there.</p>
