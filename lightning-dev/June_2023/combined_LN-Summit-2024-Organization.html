        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from this continent. Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential complexities such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he believes it is better to announce the event well in advance. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his contribution in organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could be suitable for the summit's location, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of work heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me and encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.In a response to Antoine's proposal, Bernard expresses his interest in the idea and mentions that he will reach out to discuss further.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together Lightning developers and stakeholders in Africa for the LN Summit 2024, leveraging the continent's potential and fostering local Lightning economies.</p>
