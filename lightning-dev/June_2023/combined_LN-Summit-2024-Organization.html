        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from Africa, and the potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that usually, the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain a serene engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges of organizing the summit in Africa, he believes it is better to announce it well in advance. He mentions the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency and welcomes objections or feedback on his contribution to the organization.To start the planning process, Antoine suggests surveying countries in Africa that have reasonable operational stability and could serve as suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to privately share feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of work heuristics towards the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. He encourages LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, viewing this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine is enthusiastic about the idea and hopes to receive support and participation from the Lightning community to make the LN Summit in Africa a success.</p>
