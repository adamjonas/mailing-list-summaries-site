        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. There are several reasons for holding the summit in Africa, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather," Antoine suggests announcing the summit far in advance. He also mentions the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback or objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability to determine the best location for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics towards the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, seeing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine concludes by mentioning his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the LN Summit.</p>
