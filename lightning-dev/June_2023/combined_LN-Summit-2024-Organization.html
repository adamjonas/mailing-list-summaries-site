        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from Africa. Antoine acknowledges that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling by BSV fans or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he suggests announcing the summit well in advance. He also mentions the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 to voice their concerns publicly or privately. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, believing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could be suitable for hosting the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) and encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.The email thread includes a response from Bernard, who expresses interest in Antoine's idea and states that he will reach out.</p>
