        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its natural beauty, rich cultural and historical past, and fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol. The continent also has a growing number of Lightning developers and potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges the challenges involved in organizing such an event, including visa travels and tropical weather. He suggests announcing the summit well in advance to allow for logistical preparations. While operations and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards, highlighting that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To begin the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.For communication related to the LN Summit 2024, Antoine has set up a dedicated email address: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. He also encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they wish to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses support for Antoine's proposal and indicates that he will reach out to contribute to the organization of the summit.</p>
