        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa would be an ideal location for the summit due to its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, and the need for a compatible payment protocol to solve fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states. Additionally, Africa has an energetic demography and a growing number of Lightning developers, making it a promising region for "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that typically the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given that the operational challenges for organizing the summit in Africa may be more complex, he believes it is best to announce it far ahead. Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process, with various individuals having "skin in the game. "Antoine invites feedback from Lightning developers regarding his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the realm of open-source projects.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for those interested in being part of the organization as Lightning developers. He sees this as an opportunity to facilitate knowledge transfer between different generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 aims to leverage the continent's potential, address financial system fragmentation, and foster the growth of local Lightning economies.</p>
