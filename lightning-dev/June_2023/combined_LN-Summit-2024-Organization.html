        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard proposes to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. The decision is based on several reasons, such as Africa's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems in the continent that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and an increasing number of Lightning developers coming from Africa. Antoine acknowledges that normally the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential complexity of operational challenges like visa travels and tropical weather, it is better to announce it far ahead. Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites anyone to voice objections to his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024 within the coming weeks, either publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.Antoine advises starting small by surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. He plans to share the feedback on suitable locations privately with the Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me.Lastly, Antoine encourages Lightning Network (LN) developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses his interest in Antoine's proposal and states that he will reach out to discuss further.</p>
