        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its rich cultural and historical past, the fragmentation of financial systems in the continent's 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and the growing number of Lightning developers coming from Africa. Antoine also sees great potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies in Africa.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events is typically not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges in organizing the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce it far ahead. He suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites objections to his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024 and assures that he will uphold strong transparency and accountability standards. He emphasizes the importance of action in open-source matters rather than mere talk.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses interest in Antoine's proposal and mentions that he will reach out to discuss further.</p>
