        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list is a platform for discussing channel jamming in the Lightning Network and potential solutions. One proposed solution is the HTLC endorsement scheme, which involves tracking local reputation and gathering data on its use for jamming mitigation. Different algorithms will be experimented with to track local reputation.There is debate about the effectiveness of reputation systems and their ability to provide security guarantees. Reputation data can be unreliable due to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. However, reputation schemes can still be useful in making informed decisions when choosing channel counterparties.The vulnerability of large routing nodes and the need for reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels are emphasized. Reputation should be based on the maximum damage that can be inflicted on a routing node's channel. However, there is a vulnerability where reputation can be abused during periods of high routing fees. To address this, reputation should be examined relative to a node's recent routing activity.The Lightning Network community plans to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. Each node will track the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. The community aims to experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation and observe the effect of endorsement in the steady state. The overall goal is to develop effective schemes for mitigating channel jamming.There is also a discussion about local-only reputation-based systems and the importance of understanding repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders. It is acknowledged that nodes forwarding fewer HTLCs are less likely to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes, but this should have minimal impact on their activity. Small and low-activity nodes may temporarily compete for scarce liquidity during an attack but can still interact with similar nodes to build a good reputation.The conversation also delves into the differentiation between fees charged by a node and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. The lack of transitivity in reputation acquisition cost raises vulnerability issues, and there is a concern about sacrificing earned reputation to inflict damage on another node's incoming link. The compensation mechanism for nodes with high reputation is unclear, and sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution may affect payment reliability.In another email thread, the usefulness of reputation systems in the Lightning Network is discussed. There is debate about their susceptibility to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. Fees are proposed as a way to put a price on having a good reputation, and reputation is also influenced by the general environment. Gossiping about reputations is discouraged, and only information about granting access to resources is communicated.There is also mention of data gathering efforts and the importance of understanding repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders. Large routing nodes may have sufficient data to make informed decisions, while edges may be more vulnerable but used by fewer senders, resulting in a smaller impact during an attack. Data collected from volunteers is expected to provide more insight into these issues.In a separate discussion thread, a user expresses interest in writing an extension for CLN implementation and offers help with implementation details. Another user suggests using lnmetrics as a platform for experimental data gathering and plans to follow up when data collection begins. The original user also mentions planning a machine learning post about lnmetrics and is open to discussing the necessary data to gather from the network.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming and experimenting with different schemes and reputation algorithms. They are gathering data and discussing ways to improve the HTLC endorsement scheme and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation.</p>
