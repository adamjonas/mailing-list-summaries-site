    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum, has proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow for two bundled payments in a single invoice. The proposal is aimed at providing a solution for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. This proposal has been discussed on the Lightning-dev mailing list.Bastien TEINTURIER responded to the proposal, pointing out the requirement for senders to be aware of the payment leading to a channel creation or splice on the receiver end. He suggested that extending BOLT-12 makes more sense than updating BOLT-11. However, Matt Corallo expressed doubts about the possibility of getting any kind of new interoperable change in BOLT-11. Despite the concerns raised, Thomas Voegtlin believes that it is not too late to add a new feature to BOLT-11. He suggests a new invoice feature that describes the prepayment of a fee using a different preimage. He also believes that the change should be implemented in Electrum. Thomas Voegtlin believes that the proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers.In addition to this proposal, ThomasV has made another proposal on the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding a non-interactive way to add new channels. The proposal suggests using BOLT-11, rather than BOLT-12 or onion messages, as it does not require the exchange of new messages. ThomasV believes that adding new messages would make the process unnecessarily complicated. Electrum Technologies GmbH is the company associated with ThomasV, and the email concludes with their contact information and links to the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
