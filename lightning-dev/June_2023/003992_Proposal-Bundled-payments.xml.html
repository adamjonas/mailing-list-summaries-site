    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin, the founder of Electrum, has proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow for two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The purpose of this extension is to facilitate non-custodian exchanges such as submarine swaps and JIT channels that require a prepayment of a mining fee. The proposal has received support from Lightning Labs and ACINQ. However, Matt Corallo believes that it may be too late to add a new interoperable change to BOLT-11. Bastien TEINTURIER suggests that extending BOLT-12 makes more sense than updating BOLT-11 due to the need for sender code updates. Thomas believes that it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning, but if it was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster. He also proposes making the new feature optional during a transition period.In addition to the above proposal, ThomasV, a developer at Electrum Technologies GmbH, shared another proposal on the Lightning-dev mailing list. This proposal suggests a non-interactive way to add pay-to-open functionality to the Lightning Network using BOLT-11 instead of adding new messages through BOLT-12 or onion messages. There was initial feedback suggesting the use of BOLT-12 or OM but ThomasV believes that adding new messages is not required when things can be done in a non-interactive way. Electrum Technologies GmbH is based in Berlin, Germany and provides Bitcoin wallet services.</p>
