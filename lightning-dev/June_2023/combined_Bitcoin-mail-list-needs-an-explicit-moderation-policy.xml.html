        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Maxim Orlovsky, a well-known contributor to the bitcoin community, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. The post he submitted referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published the next day, while other emails were released to bitcoin-dev. Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started asking questions about whether this post ever got to Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including a clear moderation policy, replacing Bishop with a new moderator, creating an unmoderated mail list, and reputation-based incentives for moderators. He sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that Bishop had abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. He also suspected that Orlovsky may be attributing malice to him because he asked him to stop tagging him on quantum woo. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it.</p>
