        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post was not published while other emails were released. Orlovsky accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers based on personal likes or dislikes. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including a clear moderation policy, replacement of Bishop with a new moderator, and creation of a dedicated mail list for unmoderated submissions. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis. Bishop questioned the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context.</p>
