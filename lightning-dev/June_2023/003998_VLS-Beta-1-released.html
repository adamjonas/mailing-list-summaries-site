    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2, aimed at providing security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. Developers are encouraged to join the Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta offers protection against common ways a malicious node may steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios where users might lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS on testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached.For developers, VLS offers various features such as compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. The full changelog can be found here.In the upcoming release, the VLS team plans to make the signer run in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, optimize RAM and ROM usage for modest environments, and improve performance for embedded processors. Future releases will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig capabilities.Developers looking for a meaningful open-source project to contribute to are invited to get in touch with the VLS team on Matrix to explore opportunities for involvement.</p>
