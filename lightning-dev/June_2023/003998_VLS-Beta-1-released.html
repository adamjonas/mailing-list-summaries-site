    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2, which focuses on security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. Developers are encouraged to join the VLS Matrix room, submit feature requests, or test out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta version provides security against common ways a malicious node may steal user funds, it does not cover all possible scenarios where users might lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are confident it adequately protects against relevant use case scenarios.Some highlights for developers include compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failures, a comprehensive set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state.For more details, developers can refer to the full changelog provided. The next release of VLS is planned to have the signer running in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, ability to run on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and improved performance for embedded processors.Future releases of VLS will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS Integration, and multisig capabilities. The VLS team welcomes developers who are looking for an impactful FOSS project to contribute to and encourages them to get in touch through Matrix.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [here](<a href="https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)">https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)</a>.</p>
