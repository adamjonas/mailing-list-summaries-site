    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team has announced the Beta release of their validating lightning signer, which is the MVP2 release aimed at ensuring security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. Developers are encouraged to join the Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta provides security against common ways a malicious node can steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios where users might lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and it adequately protects against relevant use case scenarios.For developers, the VLS offers various features such as compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. A full changelog can be found [here](<a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The</a> next release of VLS is planned to include running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, running on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors. Future releases aim to incorporate routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig functionality.Developers looking for a meaningful open-source project to contribute to are invited to get in touch with the VLS team on Matrix to explore opportunities for involvement.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [here](<a href="https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)">https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)</a>.</p>
