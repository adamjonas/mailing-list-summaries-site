    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The VLS team has announced the beta release of the validating lightning signer, which is designed to be secure against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. LN application developers are encouraged to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes. While the beta version is secure against common ways a malicious node could steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios where users might lose funds. It is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached. For developers, the VLS beta offers several highlights including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state, and more. The full changelog can be found [here](<a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The</a> next release of VLS is planned to include improvements such as running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, running on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors. Future releases will focus on routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig. Developers looking for a FOSS project to contribute to are invited to get in touch with the VLS team on Matrix to see how they can get involved.
