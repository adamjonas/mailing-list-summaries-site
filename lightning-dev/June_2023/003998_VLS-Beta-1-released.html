    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The VLS team has announced the Beta release of the validating lightning signer, which is their MVP2 release aimed at providing security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. LN application developers are encouraged to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes. While the VLS beta is secure against common ways a malicious node can steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios of fund loss. It is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached.For developers, the validating lightning signer offers several highlights including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. The full changelog can be found [here](<a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).Planned">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).Planned</a> for the next release of VLS are features such as running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, running on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors. Future releases will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig.For developers looking to contribute to an impactful FOSS project, the VLS team welcomes their help and encourages them to get in touch through Matrix.</p>
