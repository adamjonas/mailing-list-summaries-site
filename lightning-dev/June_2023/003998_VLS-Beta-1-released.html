    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team has announced the Beta release of their validating lightning signer, which is their MVP2 release aimed at ensuring security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. LN application developers are encouraged to join the Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta version is secure against common ways that a malicious node may steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios in which a user might lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds in production until reaching the production release milestone and being confident in its ability to adequately protect against relevant use case scenarios.For developers, VLS offers compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state, and more. The full changelog can be found [here](<a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).Planned">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).Planned</a> for the next release of VLS are improvements such as running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, the ability to run the signer on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors.In later releases, VLS plans to include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig functionality. Developers looking for a rewarding FOSS project to contribute to are invited to get in touch with the VLS team on Matrix to explore potential involvement opportunities.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [vls.tech](<a href="https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)">https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)</a>.</p>
