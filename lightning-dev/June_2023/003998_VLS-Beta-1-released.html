    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2, which focuses on secure transactions and protection against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They are encouraging LN application developers to actively participate by joining their Matrix room, submitting feature requests, or testing VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta release provides security against common methods used by malicious nodes to steal user funds, it does not cover all possible scenarios where users may still lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are confident that it fully safeguards against relevant scenarios.For developers, the VLS Beta offers several highlights, including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery options, a comprehensive set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, complete layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. The full changelog can be found [here](<a href="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).The</a> next release plans to include a signer that runs in a `no-std` environment without the need for a standard library. Additionally, the signer will be optimized to work efficiently with limited amounts of RAM and ROM, targeting embedded processors.Future releases of VLS are expected to incorporate routing capabilities, support for BOLT-12, VSS integration, and multisig functionality.For developers looking for an engaging FOSS project to contribute to, the VLS team welcomes their help and encourages them to reach out through Matrix to explore opportunities for involvement.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [here](<a href="https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)">https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/)</a>.</p>
