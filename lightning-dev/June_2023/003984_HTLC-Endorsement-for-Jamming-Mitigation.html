    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the discussion, Bob's ability to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC is mentioned. This ability is determined by the credit that Bob gives to Alice's judgment. If Bob chooses to forward Alice's HTLC, he runs the risk of suffering damage if Alice turns out to be a jamming attacker. The amount of damage inflicted should be proportional to the revenue that Alice has recently created for Bob, meaning that the more damage caused, the higher the threshold.The compensation mechanism in the chain of nodes with high reputation is unclear. The HTLC endorsement system may suffer from classic issues of reputation systems, such as whitewashing. It is guaranteed that if a node is jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening. However, there is no information about who is paying or the cost of the attack.There seems to be a coupling effect between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. This coupling effect is related to the adjustment of channel liquidity and slots based on the local topology reputation.The reading on channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes, but each node only receives information about the liquidity available to them, rather than the state of the channel in general. This may result in fluctuations in liquidity available to a specific node.Overall, there is a need for more rigorous analysis and evaluation of any proposed jamming solution in terms of its effectiveness and potential drawbacks. Without such analysis, it is difficult to set measurable bounds or determine when a solution may cause harm instead of providing relief to routing node operators.</p>
