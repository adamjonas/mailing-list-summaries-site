    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation begins with a discussion on the HTLC endorsement system and its compensation mechanism for nodes that are victims of jamming attacks. The question is raised about whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim, and if so, whether the ratio between the fees and the reputation is static or dynamic. The design goals of the proposed system are also questioned.The lack of a formal definition of the problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation is highlighted, with the "unjamming lightning" paper claiming to systematically analyze the solution space without providing a formalized problem definition. The author emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis, similar to modern cryptanalysis, to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution and establish measurable bounds.The author expresses concern about the undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, in the financial cryptography/computer security literature. They argue that caution should be exercised in deploying half-baked mitigations that could potentially cause more harm than relief to routing node operators.The conversation then shifts to the potential impact of HTLC endorsement on link-level liquidity and the need for simulations to assess how it might downgrade HTLC routing traffic. It is acknowledged that any proposed jamming solution would likely have trade-offs and affect routing traffic success.Overall, the conversation raises important questions and concerns regarding the HTLC endorsement system, the compensation mechanism for jamming attacks, the lack of formal problem definition, and the need for rigorous analysis and evaluation of any proposed jamming solution.</p>
