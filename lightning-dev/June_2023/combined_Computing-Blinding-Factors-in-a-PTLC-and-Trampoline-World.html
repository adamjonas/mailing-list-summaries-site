        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj proposes a method for computing blinding factors in onion routing. The objective is to achieve specific properties, such as non-Trampoline nodes only needing one blinding factor and Trampoline nodes being able to provide blinding factors without revealing their involvement. The demonstration begins with the ultimate receiver having a secret value 'r' and providing the point 'R'. In a scenario without intermediate nodes, the ultimate sender chooses a random scalar 'e' as the error blinding factor and constructs an onion that can be decrypted by the ultimate receiver. The ultimate sender also offers a PTLC with the point 'e * G + R'. The ultimate receiver can claim the PTLC by revealing 'e + r'. The demonstration then extends to include an intermediate node named Carol. The ultimate sender still chooses a random scalar 'e' but now needs to generate two scalars 'c' and 'd' such that 'c + d = e'. This can be done by selecting a random 'd' and computing 'c = e - d'. The ultimate sender encrypts the onion with 'e' encrypted to the ultimate receiver and the ciphertext along with 'd' encrypted to Carol. For each intermediate non-Trampoline node like Carol, it adds its per-hop blinding factor times 'G' to the input point and uses the result as the output point to the next hop. Carol receives 'c * G + R', adds 'd * G', and sends a PTLC with the point 'c * G + R + d * G'.In the case where Carol is a Trampoline node, additional steps are followed. The ultimate sender learns 'R' and selects a random 'e'. It also selects 'c' and 'd' such that 'c + d = e'. The ultimate sender computes a Trampoline-level onion with 'e' encrypted to the ultimate receiver and the above ciphertext, 'd', and the next Trampoline hop encrypted to Carol. The PTLC sent to Carol is 'c * G + R'. Carol decrypts the onion and obtains 'd'. It then searches for a route from Carol to the ultimate receiver. Assuming it finds a route Carol -> Alice -> ultimate receiver, Carol needs to make 'c * G + d * G + R' reach the ultimate receiver. To achieve this, Carol selects two scalars 'a' and 'b' such that 'a + b = d'. It creates an onion with the copied ciphertext from the ultimate sender, the above ciphertext, and 'b' encrypted to Alice. The PTLC sent to Alice is 'c * G + R + a * G'. Alice decrypts the onion and learns 'b'. She forwards the PTLC with the point 'c * G + R + a * G + b * G' to the next hop, the ultimate receiver. By construction, the ultimate receiver gets the same 'e * G + R' regardless of whether it was reached via a Trampoline or directly. On claiming, every intermediate node has enough data to claim its incoming PTLC. Only the ultimate sender knows 'c', which allows it to recover the 'r'.</p>
