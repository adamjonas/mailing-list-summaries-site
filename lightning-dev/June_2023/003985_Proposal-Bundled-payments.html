    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Dave, the semantics of bundled payments are discussed. According to Thomas, a BOLT-11 invoice should contain two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. He further explains that the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the pre-payment should be failed with a MPP timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. However, Thomas notes that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.Dave raises a question regarding whether a BOLT11 invoice is required to contain a payment hash for the prepayment. He suggests using a keysend payment with the onion message payload to indicate which payment hash should be associated with the prepayment. For example, if Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to hash 0123...cdef with a prepayment of 10k sats, the 10k sats would be sent via keysend with metadata indicating that the receiver shouldn't claim it until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC to 0123...cdef.Dave proposes extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and allow encoding in existing BOLT11 fields like the description or metadata field. This would enable immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.The email conversation provides insights into the semantics of bundled payments and explores potential improvements to BOLT11 invoices for more efficient processing of prepayments.</p>
