    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Dave, they discuss the semantics of bundled payments in the context of BOLT-11 invoices. Voegtlin explains that a BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: a prepayment and a main payment. He states that the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the receiver should fail the pre-payment with a MPP (Multi-Path Payment) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver can fulfill the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcast their on-chain transaction. It is important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.Dave then asks if it is necessary for a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He provides an example where Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to a specific hash with a prepayment of 10k sats. In this case, the 10k sats would be sent via keysend with metadata indicating that the receiver shouldn't claim it until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC to the specified hash.Dave suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field to accommodate this approach. He mentions that this would make the invoice significantly smaller and could potentially be encoded in existing BOLT11 fields like the description or metadata fields. This would allow for immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.</p>
