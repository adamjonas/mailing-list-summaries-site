    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Dave, the semantics of bundled payments are discussed. According to Thomas, a BOLT-11 invoice should contain two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the receiver should fail the pre-payment with a MPP (Multi-Path Payments) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. However, the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.Dave suggests an alternative approach for the prepayment. He asks if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. For example, Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to hash 0123...cdef with a prepayment of 10k sats. In this case, the 10k sats would be sent via keysend with metadata indicating that the receiver shouldn't claim it until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC to 0123...cdef.If this alternative approach is implemented, Dave suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field. This would make the invoices significantly smaller and also allow encoding the extra_fee_via_keysend field in an existing BOLT11 field like the description or metadata field. This immediate implementation could be used until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.The email exchange highlights a discussion on the semantics of bundled payments and a potential alternative approach for the prepayment process.</p>
