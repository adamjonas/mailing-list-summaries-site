    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin discusses the semantics of bundled payments. He explains that a BOLT-11 invoice should contain two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Lock Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the pre-payment should be failed with a MPP (Multi-Path Payments) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. It is important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.Dave suggests an alternative approach to using a payment hash for the prepayment in a BOLT11 invoice. He proposes using a keysend payment with the onion message payload to indicate what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. For example, Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to hash 0123...cdef with a prepayment of 10k sats. In this case, the 10k sats would be sent via keysend with metadata indicating that the receiver shouldn't claim it until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC to 0123...cdef.Dave further suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field to accommodate this alternative approach. This would make the invoice significantly smaller and allow for encoding the extra_fee_via_keysend field in existing BOLT11 fields like the description or metadata field. This implementation could be done immediately until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.Overall, the discussion revolves around the semantics of bundled payments and an alternative approach to incorporating prepayment in BOLT11 invoices.</p>
