    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It appears that there is a need for moderation to address the issue of spam. This suggests that there has been an increase in unwanted and unsolicited content that requires immediate attention. The mention of "tamp down" implies the importance of taking swift action to reduce or eliminate the presence of spam. The message concludes with the phrase "See y'all Monday," indicating that the person responsible for moderation will be away temporarily, possibly over the weekend. This suggests that the issue will be addressed promptly upon their return. To gain further insight or context about this situation, it would be helpful to refer to any relevant links provided.</p>
