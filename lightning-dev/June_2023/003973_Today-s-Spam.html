    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>It appears that there is a need for moderation to be implemented again in order to control the spam. The individual who has provided this information, Matt, states that he will be absent until Monday. This implies that the moderation issue might not be addressed immediately and may require attention in the coming week.Without further details, it is unclear what specific actions need to be taken to address the spam problem. However, the mention of moderation suggests that some form of content monitoring or filtering needs to be put in place. This could involve the removal of irrelevant or inappropriate content, as well as the prevention of automated spam bots from flooding the platform.In order to fully understand the severity of the spam issue, additional context is required. It would be helpful to know if this is a recurring problem or if it has recently escalated. Furthermore, information about the platform or community affected by the spam would provide more insight into the impact and urgency of the situation.Given the lack of specific details, it is difficult to propose potential solutions or recommendations. However, it is generally advised to employ a combination of automated filters and human moderation to effectively combat spam. Automated filters can identify and block common spam patterns, while human moderators can review flagged content and make judgment calls on borderline cases.In conclusion, there is a need for moderation to address a spam problem. However, the lack of specific information limits our understanding of the situation and the necessary steps to be taken. It is important for the issue to be properly assessed and appropriate measures put in place to ensure the platform or community is protected from spam in the future.</p>
