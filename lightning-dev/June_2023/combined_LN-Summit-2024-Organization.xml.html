        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024 due to several reasons such as the beauty of the continent, its rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in financial systems, explosive demography, and opportunities for developing local Lightning economies. Usually, such events are not announced publicly to avoid disturbances from non-engineers, but given that operational challenges in Africa could be more complex, announcement far ahead is necessary. The event's operations and finances are expected to be okay, but multi-stakeholder participation would guarantee fairness and transparency of the process. Antoine will survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location and share the feedback privately to the attendees based on neutral and technical proof-of-works heuristics. He has also set up a dedicated communication endpoint for LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me and welcomes LN developers to join the organization for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.</p>
