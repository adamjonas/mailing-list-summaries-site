    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposes to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the venue, including its cultural and historical significance, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for establishing local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that it is not common to announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels due to the desire for engineering conversations to remain serene and to avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce the summit well in advance. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites any objections or concerns about his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability. He encourages participants to speak through their actions rather than just words in matters of open-source.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics, at the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the LN Summit organization. He invites Lightning Network developers to reach out and sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the LN Summit.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together the Lightning community in Africa for the LN Summit 2024, highlighting the continent's potential and creating opportunities for collaboration and growth in the Lightning Network ecosystem.</p>
