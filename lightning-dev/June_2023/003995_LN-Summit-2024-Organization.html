    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its natural beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, growing number of Lightning developers, and the potential for local Lightning economies. While it is not customary to announce such events on open communication channels, Antoine believes that announcing it early will help address operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather". He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes feedback and objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in open source projects and encourages individuals to speak through their actions. As a first step, he plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the best location for the summit. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose.LN developers are invited to reach out if they wish to be part of the organization, as the summit presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, giving him a solid operational template to work with.Overall, Antoine's proposal for organizing the LN Summit in Africa highlights the potential benefits of holding the event on the continent and calls for active participation from the Lightning community in making it a success.</p>
