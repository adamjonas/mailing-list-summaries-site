    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for selecting Africa as the location, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. However, unlike previous events, Antoine suggested announcing the organization of the LN Summit ahead of time to address operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather."Antoine encouraged the Lightning devs to provide any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. He emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, stating that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine proposed surveying countries with reasonable operational stability in Africa, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He planned to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provided a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for those interested in being part of the organization. He encouraged LN developers to seize this opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine mentioned that he had co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, indicating that he already had operational templates for reference.Overall, Antoine's proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback, and preparations for the event were set in motion.</p>
