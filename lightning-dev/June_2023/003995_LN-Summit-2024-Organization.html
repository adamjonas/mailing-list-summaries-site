    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its natural beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and "tropical weather," Antoine believes it is better to announce the event well in advance. While operations and financial resources should be sufficient, a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" would ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes the importance of strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for those interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.It is worth noting that Antoine previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and already has operational templates in place.For more information, refer to the original email thread: [Link]</p>
