    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential to foster local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of such an event is typically not announced on open communication channels due to the desire for serenity in engineering conversations and to avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce it well in advance.While the operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process. He invites objections or feedback on his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards.To begin the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share the findings privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for those interested in participating in the organization of the summit. He encourages Lightning Network developers to seize this opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which serves as a template for the operational aspects of the LN Summit.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa presents an exciting opportunity to leverage the continent's potential and address the specific challenges and opportunities it offers for the Lightning Network.</p>
