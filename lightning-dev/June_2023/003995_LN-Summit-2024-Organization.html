    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa next year, with a tentative date in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential to foster local Lightning economies.In his email, Antoine mentioned that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is typically not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid potential trolling. However, due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believed it would be better to announce it well in advance. He also emphasized the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach and having "skin in the game" to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invited any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024, encouraging people to express their thoughts publicly or privately. He pledged to adhere to strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing the significance of actions in the open-source community.To kickstart the project, Antoine suggested starting small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intended to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine provided a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He mentioned that he already had operational templates from co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.Overall, Antoine's proposal aimed to bring together Lightning developers in Africa for the LN Summit in 2024, highlighting the continent's potential and the need for collaborative efforts to ensure the success of the event.</p>
