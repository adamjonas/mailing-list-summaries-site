    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location due to its cultural and historical significance, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Although the organization of CoreDev or LN Summits is typically not announced on public channels to maintain a peaceful engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism, Antoine suggests announcing the event well in advance due to potential operational challenges such as visas and tropical weather. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and assures transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees later in the summer.To facilitate communication, Antoine has set up a dedicated email address: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. He encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization and view it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Having previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, Antoine already has operational templates in place.For more information, refer to the original email on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
