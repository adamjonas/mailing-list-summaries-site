    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa for next year, with a tentative date in June 2024. He listed several reasons why Africa would be an ideal location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and the growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. He also mentioned the potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledged that it is not common to announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, but due to the operational challenges involved (such as visa travels and tropical weather), he believed it was better to announce it well in advance. He emphasized the importance of having a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine encouraged anyone who had objections or concerns about his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 to let him know in the coming weeks. He expressed his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing the importance of actions in the open-source community.He suggested starting small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He planned to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine provided a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 and invited Lightning Network developers to reach out if they wanted to be part of the organization, seeing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.In closing, Antoine mentioned that he had already co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, giving him prior experience with the operational templates.For more information, you can refer to the original email thread [0].</p>
