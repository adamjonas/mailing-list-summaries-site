    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bernard expresses excitement and agrees to reach out about an idea proposed by Antoine regarding the organization of next year's LN Summit in Africa. Antoine believes that there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, financial system fragmentation in the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and the potential for growth in "full-stack" local Lightning economies. Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not made on open channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to operational challenges such as visas and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing the event far in advance. He also mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient, but a multi-stakeholder approach would ensure fairness and transparency. Antoine invites objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability. He plans to survey countries with operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit and share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint for the summit and encourages LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, highlighting the opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Antoine mentions that he has already co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and has the operational templates for reference.</p>
