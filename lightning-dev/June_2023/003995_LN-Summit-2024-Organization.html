    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and potential for local Lightning economies. Normally, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity and avoid trolling, but in this case, it was decided to announce it well in advance due to the complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather.Antoine emphasized the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. He invited feedback and objections from the community regarding his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024. He pledged to uphold strong transparency and accountability standards and encouraged others to speak through their actions rather than mere words in matters of open-source.To initiate the project, Antoine suggested starting small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can accommodate the event, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and more. He promised to privately share the feedback based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics with the Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provided a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization. He emphasized that it would be a great opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.It is worth mentioning that Antoine had previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the LN Summit.For more details, you can refer to the original email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
