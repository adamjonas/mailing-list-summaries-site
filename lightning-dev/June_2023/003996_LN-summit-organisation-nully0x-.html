    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Normally, the organization of such events is not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the operational challenges involved, it is best to announce it well in advance. Operations and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, but a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" is encouraged for fairness and transparency.Antoine invites any objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024 and emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and more. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) and encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization to facilitate knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Overall, this proposal aims to bring together the lightning dev community for the LN Summit in Africa, leveraging the continent's potential and addressing operational challenges to ensure a successful event.</p>
