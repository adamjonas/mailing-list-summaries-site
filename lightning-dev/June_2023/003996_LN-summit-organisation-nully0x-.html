    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. This proposal aims to leverage the rich cultural and historical background of the continent, address financial system fragmentation, and tap into the growing number of Lightning developers from Africa. The announcement of the summit is being made early to allow for operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather to be addressed. While the organization's operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, a multi-stakeholder approach is encouraged to ensure fairness and transparency. Antoine welcomes objections or feedback on his contribution to the organization. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. A dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, has been set up for interested Lightning developers to reach out and be part of the organization.</p>
