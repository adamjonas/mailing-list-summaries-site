    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the summit's location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to flourish.Antoine acknowledges the operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and "tropical weather." To ensure fairness and transparency, he suggests a multi-stakeholder approach, with various individuals contributing their resources and expertise to the organization process. Antoine welcomes any objections or feedback regarding his role in organizing the LN Summit 2024.He plans to start small by surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The feedback from this survey will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization and transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine also mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the LN Summit.</p>
