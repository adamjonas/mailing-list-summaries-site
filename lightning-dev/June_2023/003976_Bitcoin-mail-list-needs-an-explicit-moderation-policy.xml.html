    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a well-known Bitcoin developer, sent an email to bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. However, his post was not released to the mail list while other emails were released. After asking questions about why his post was not published, he realized that there is no clear moderation or peer-review policies in bitcoin-dev mail list. Bryan Bishop, who was acting for a long time as moderator, abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. In response to this issue, Dr. Orlovsky proposed some solutions such as having clear moderation policies, replacing the current moderator with a new one, creating a dedicated mail list “bitcoin-dev-unmoderated” which will publish all submissions without moderation, and more. He also mentioned that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Dr. Orlovsky believes that the failure to have explicit moderation policies can lead to censorship and inconsistency in publishing posts to the mail list.</p>
