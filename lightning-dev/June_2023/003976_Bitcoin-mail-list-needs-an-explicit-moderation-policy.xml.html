    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a prominent contributor to the Bitcoin community, wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussing the lack of clear moderation policy and how it affected his post from being published. He proposed that the mailing list should have a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy and replace Bryan Bishop, who was acting as moderator, with a new moderator who is selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against." He also suggested that a dedicated mail list should be created for non-moderated submissions, which would contain spam, but if some non-spam emails were censored, then they could announce that publicly. The incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. In addition, he shared a conversation over Twitter to showcase the problem he faced with the current moderation policy. If the title of a post is just a reply to some existing topic, there are fewer strict rules than creating a new topic. Starting a new topic requires more effort and has more sieves compared to replying to an existing topic. Moderators' role should be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences.</p>
