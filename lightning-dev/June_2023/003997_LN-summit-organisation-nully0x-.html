    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN (Lightning Network) Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and potential for local Lightning economies. Normally, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels, but in this case, Antoine believes it is necessary to announce it ahead of time due to operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach for fairness and transparency. Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries with operational stability that can host the event, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me and encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization and contribute to knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.In addition, there are existing Bitcoin and Lightning Network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, which organize local meetups focused on technical sessions. It is suggested to connect with these communities first to bootstrap planning for the LN Summit.The conversation took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list, and nully0x expressed support for the proposal and suggested reaching out to the existing communities in Africa.</p>
