    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev community is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. The continent offers many advantages such as its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an explosive demography, and a growing number of Lightning developers. To ensure fairness and transparency, a multi-stakeholder approach is preferred for the organization, with "skin in the game" from various individuals. To start the planning process, it is suggested to connect with existing Bitcoin communities in Africa that organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the lightning network. Examples include Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. Surveying these communities will help in determining potential host countries for the summit. A list of countries to survey has been provided, including Algeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda. Once feedback is received, private surveys will be conducted with senior Lightning developers to address any potential visa issues and reach a consensus on the host country. The proposal has been well-received by the lightning dev community, and further discussions will take place privately. The organizers are encouraging Lightning developers to participate in the organization of the summit, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Overall, the plan is to announce the LN Summit 2024 well in advance due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather. The organizers aim to maintain serenity in the engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. They have set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the project and are prepared to ensure strong transparency and accountability standards. This initiative builds upon the experience gained from co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.</p>
