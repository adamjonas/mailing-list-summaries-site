    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev community is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. The goal is to leverage the rich cultural and historical past, address financial system fragmentation, and tap into the energy and potential of the continent. To ensure a smooth planning process, it is suggested to connect with existing Bitcoin communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, who organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning network. The first step would be to survey active Bitcoin communities in countries like Algeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda.Once feedback is obtained, the next step would involve privately surveying senior Lightning developers to address any potential visa issues and determine the country that can gather consensus for hosting the event. The organizers emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in the planning process and encourage Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. This presents an excellent opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.To facilitate communication regarding the LN Summit 2024, a dedicated email address has been set up: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. The organizers have previous experience in co-organizing events, such as the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides a solid operational template. By involving multiple stakeholders and ensuring fairness and transparency, the organizers aim to create a successful and impactful LN Summit in Africa.[Original message from nully0x via Lightning-dev mailing list]</p>
