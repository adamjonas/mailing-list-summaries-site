    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons why Africa would be a suitable location for the summit, including its cultural diversity, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers in the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to flourish. Antoine acknowledged that operational challenges, such as visa travels and tropical weather, might arise and suggested announcing the event well in advance for better preparation.To ensure fairness and transparency in the organization process, Antoine encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" from various individuals. He invited feedback or objections to his contribution to the organization in the coming weeks. Antoine emphasized his commitment to setting high standards of transparency and accountability and welcomed Lightning developers to participate in the organization effort as a means of transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine proposed surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He planned to gather feedback privately based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer. Antoine also mentioned that he had previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and had operational templates in place.Additionally, the discussion highlighted the existence of different Bitcoin and lightning network-focused community meetups across Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. It was suggested to connect with these communities first to facilitate planning.Overall, Antoine's proposal generated positive responses within the Lightning-dev community, and steps were being taken to explore potential hosting countries and engage with relevant stakeholders.</p>
