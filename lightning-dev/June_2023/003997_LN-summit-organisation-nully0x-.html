    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine highlighted several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, the need for a compatible payment protocol to solve financial fragmentation, the growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies. Normally, the organization of such events is not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolling. However, given the operational challenges that may arise, it was decided to make this announcement early. Antoine assured transparency and accountability in the process and encouraged feedback or objections to his contribution to the organization. To start small, the plan is to survey countries with operational stability that can accommodate the event, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose and invited Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization and transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the email thread that various communities across Africa already organize local meetups focused on technical sessions related to Bitcoin and the Lightning network. Examples include Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. It was suggested to connect with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process. The next step would involve surveying senior Lightning developers privately to address any potential visa troubles and determine which country can gather consensus.Overall, the proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback and was considered a great idea by the Lightning-dev community.</p>
