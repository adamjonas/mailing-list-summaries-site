    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its cultural diversity, fragmented financial systems, growing number of Lightning developers, and potential to develop local Lightning economies. The announcement was made openly to ensure transparency and accountability, even though it is not typically done to maintain serenity in engineering conversations. Operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather were also mentioned, and it was suggested to start small by surveying countries with operational stability like Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the project and invited Lightning developers to join the organization and transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.It was noted that different communities across Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning network. It was recommended to connect with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process. The discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list, where nully0x expressed support for Antoine's proposal and suggested reaching out privately to these African communities. The email thread included information about subscribing and unsubscribing from the mailing list and contacting the list manager.Overall, the proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback from the Lightning-dev community, and there are plans to survey active Bitcoin communities in African countries to gauge interest in hosting the event.</p>
