    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Unlike previous events, Antoine suggests announcing the organization of the summit ahead of time to address operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather. He also emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in the process, encouraging feedback and participation from the Lightning community.To begin the planning process, Antoine suggests surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and more. He plans to gather feedback privately from Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose at lnsummit2024@ariard.me.Additionally, Antoine invites Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He concludes by referencing his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and expresses his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards.It is also mentioned in the email thread that various communities across Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning network. It is suggested that connecting with these communities would be a good first step in the planning process.</p>
