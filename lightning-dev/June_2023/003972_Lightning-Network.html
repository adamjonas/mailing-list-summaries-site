    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>I would like to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since I registered it. The update you see on who.is is simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. It seems that Peter Todd believes otherwise and has made false statements about the domain. Despite his smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I want to remind him that I see everything. With his great technology knowledge, he should stop arguing and work harder.In addition, I have added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. This was done to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have many other ways to prove that I am the real Satoshi, but I never cared to do so because I know that I am the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. I also want to compliment the Lightning team for their excellent work. The Lightning Network is a great achievement and it allows for fast and secure global business transactions. Bitcoin has been a huge success and will continue to scale.It is worth mentioning that Peter Todd has pointed out that the domain vistomail.com recently changed ownership based on the updated whois records and website content. However, I assure you that this is not the case. The change in ownership was simply an update to extend the ownership years. Peter Todd assumes that this is another scammer pretending to be me, but his assumption is incorrect. I suggest we block the entire domain from the list.Overall, I appreciate the work of the Lightning team and their contribution to the advancement of Bitcoin. I have added my lightning address to express my support and gratitude. Thank you for making me feel welcomed.Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
