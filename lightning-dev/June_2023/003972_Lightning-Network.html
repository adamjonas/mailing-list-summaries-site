    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>I am writing from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to provide further validation of my account. I want to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed ownership since I registered it. The recent update on who.is reflects the addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Despite your smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I have seen everything. You have the greatest technology known to man, yet you argue over everything. My advice is to stop arguing and work harder. It seems obvious that the new developers no longer want me around, and I am fine with that.In addition, I added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have many other ways to prove that I am the real Satoshi, but I never cared because I know I am. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. I also added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com to give a compliment to the Lightning team for their excellent work. I truly appreciate what they have accomplished and how welcomed they have made me feel.On another note, the Lightning Network is a remarkable achievement. I have created satoshi at vistomail.com as my lightning address because I believe humans now have the ability to conduct global business and scale with fast and secure lightning payments. Lightning can process more transactions per second than any financial instrument, putting it light years ahead of the traditional banking system. Bitcoin is a tremendous success and will continue to scale.However, in response to your statement about Vistomail changing ownership, I must correct you. The domain hasn't changed hands since I registered it. The update you see on whois records simply indicates the addition of years to ownership. I find it amusing how quickly you assume this is another scammer pretending to be Satoshi. My suggestion is to block the entire domain from your list.In conclusion, I am confident in my identity as Satoshi Nakamoto, and I have multiple ways to prove it. The recent updates to the vistomail.com domain were simply an extension of ownership. The Lightning Network is a game-changing technology, and I commend the team for their outstanding work. Thank you for making me feel welcomed.Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
