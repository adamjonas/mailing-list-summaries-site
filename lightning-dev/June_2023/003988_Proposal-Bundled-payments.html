    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Thomas Voegtlin proposes an extension to BOLT-11, suggesting that invoices can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This proposal aims to address the prepayment of mining fees for non-custodian exchanges like submarine swaps and JIT channels. The goal is to level the competition between lightning service providers by bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same invoice.Bastien Teinturier responds to Thomas' proposal, emphasizing the need for senders to be aware of the channel creation on the receiver end. He suggests three strategies for providing just-in-time (JIT) liquidity: asking the receiver for the preimage and a fee, opening a channel and forwarding the HTLC amount minus a fee, or pre-paying the fee and forwarding the whole HTLC amount on that channel. The current strategies used on the network are the first two options, and Bastien also addresses the use of 0-conf and the potential inclusion of the proposed feature in BOLT-12.Matt Corallo expresses skepticism about adding new interoperable changes to BOLT-11, citing the lack of broad support for existing features like amount-less BOLT-11 invoices. He suggests exploring the obviating factors of splice-out and building the proposed feature on onion messages (OMs) for enhanced privacy.Thomas responds to Matt's concerns, emphasizing that the proposed change is minimal and only requires a new invoice feature describing the prepayment of a fee using a different preimage. He suggests making this feature optional during a transition period by defining a new feature bit, introducing two extra fields, and specifying the behavior for senders who do not support the feature. Thomas argues that including the feature in BOLT-11 would benefit Lightning Labs' Loop service and ACINQ's pay-to-open service, making them non-custodian and compliant with the upcoming MICA regulation.Thomas also addresses the distinction between submarine swaps and splice-outs, highlighting the need for receiving capacity in submarine swaps.In conclusion, Thomas believes that bundling prepayment and main payment in BOLT-11 invoices would address issues related to mining fee attacks and custodian services, leveling the competition in the lightning network. He argues for simplicity by implementing the proposal in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages.The email context is a signature of Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany.
