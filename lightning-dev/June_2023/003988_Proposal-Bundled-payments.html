    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Hello Bastien, thank you for the clarification. It seems I may not have been clear about the need for senders to understand the new fields. You mentioned two possible solutions: blacklisting non-cooperative clients and manipulating the mempool. However, these approaches are susceptible to griefing attacks and may be costly for small companies to implement. You also expressed surprise if ACINQ is using this approach. You believe that pre-payment of the mining fee can be combined with 0-conf, and that 0-conf will still be relevant even with BOLT-12. However, it's important to note that BOLT-12 has not yet been implemented in Electrum. You are eager to know if bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 are required. You plan on adding BOLT-12 support to Electrum in the coming months. You also mentioned that you think it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, if this feature were included in BOLT-11, it could be adopted much faster. Your proposal aims to level the playing field for Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet and enabling companies to provide JIT channels without distributing a dedicated wallet. It's worth noting that a dedicated client will still be necessary to verify the redeem script and invoice, as well as sweep the funds. Implementing this proposal sooner rather than later could have a significant impact on the ecosystem, although its understanding by everyone remains to be seen.The Lightning-dev mailing list is hosted on lists.linuxfoundation.org and is maintained by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany.
