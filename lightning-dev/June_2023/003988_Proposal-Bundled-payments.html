    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network protocol. The proposal involves adding a feature to allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This feature is aimed at services that require prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges like submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, some services can ask for prepayment because their software can handle it, but others cannot, leaving them vulnerable to DoS attacks or exclusion from certain regulations.Thomas believes that bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice would level the competition field between Lightning service providers. He suggests that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages because it does not require the exchange of new messages. Thomas also mentions that he believes it will take years for his proposal to become the dominant payment method on Lightning, but if adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.However, Bastien Teinturier raises some concerns about Thomas' proposal. He points out that implementing the proposal would require senders to be aware that the payment will lead to a channel creation or splice on the receiver's end. He suggests extending BOLT-12 instead of updating BOLT-11 because it requires new sender code anyway. Bastien also discusses different strategies for providing just-in-time (JIT) liquidity and mentions that the current strategies do not require senders to be aware of JIT liquidity. He agrees that if 0-conf is no longer used, pre-paying fees would make more sense, but since 0-conf is still being used until BOLT-12 is deployed, it would be more reasonable to include the new feature in BOLT-12.The proposal by Thomas has potential support from Lightning Labs and ACINQ, who could benefit from the proposed changes. Thomas suggests that the implementation of his proposal would have a significant impact on the shape of the Lightning ecosystem and emphasizes the importance of understanding this by everyone involved. Overall, Thomas proposes adding a feature to BOLT-11 that allows bundled payments in invoices, aiming to address issues faced by services requiring prepayment for non-custodian exchanges. Bastien raises concerns about the proposal and suggests alternative approaches.The email context provided is from Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany.
