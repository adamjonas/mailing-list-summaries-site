    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin proposes an extension to BOLT-11 that allows invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The purpose of this proposal is to address the need for prepayment of mining fees in services like submarine swaps and JIT channels.Currently, services that require prepayment can ask for it when using dedicated client software, but competitors who do not require a dedicated wallet are vulnerable to DoS attacks and legal issues. By bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same invoice, service providers can ensure that both payments arrive before fulfilling the pre-payment HTLCs.This proposal aims to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers and allow non-custodian exchanges to take place without the need for a dedicated wallet. Thomas suggests implementing this change in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages to keep things simple and non-interactive. He believes that this proposal could benefit Lightning Labs and ACINQ, among others.The context provided is an email signature that includes the contact details of Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany. The signature also mentions the company's registration details, including its location, the Registergericht (the court where the company is registered), and the HRB (Handelsregisterblatt) number, which is used to identify the company in the German commercial register.The email signature further states that the Geschäftsführer (managing director) of Electrum Technologies GmbH is Thomas Voegtlin. It is common practice for companies to include such information in their email signatures to provide recipients with the necessary contact details and legal information.The email signature is followed by a footer that contains a mailing list subscription link. This link redirects to a web page hosted on lists.linuxfoundation.org, where users can subscribe to the Lightning-dev mailing list. The Lightning-dev mailing list is a platform for developers interested in lightning network technology, which is designed to enable faster and cheaper bitcoin transactions.By providing this link in the email signature, the sender is inviting recipients to join the mailing list if they are interested in discussing and collaborating on lightning network development. The use of the link also allows the sender to easily manage and track subscriptions to the mailing list.In summary, the email signature provides the contact details and registration information of Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany. It also includes a link to the Lightning-dev mailing list hosted on lists.linuxfoundation.org, inviting recipients to join the mailing list for discussions on lightning network technology.</p>
