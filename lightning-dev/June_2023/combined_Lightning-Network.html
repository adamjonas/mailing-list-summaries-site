        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's statement about the domain vistomail.com, clarifying that he is still the owner of the domain and the recent update on who.is was just a purchase update to extend the ownership. He sarcastically mentioned Peter's smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, stating that he sees everything and encourages Peter to stop arguing and work harder. Satoshi also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin. He further mentioned that he has many other ways to prove his identity as the real Satoshi but never cared to do so because he knows he is the real deal. Satoshi expressed his appreciation for the Lightning team's work and complimented them on the great achievement of the Lightning Network. He thanked them for making him feel welcomed.In response to Satoshi's email, Peter Todd pointed out that Vistomail recently changed ownership, based on the updated whois records and website content. He suggested blocking the entire domain from the list, assuming it to be another scammer pretending to be Satoshi.</p>
