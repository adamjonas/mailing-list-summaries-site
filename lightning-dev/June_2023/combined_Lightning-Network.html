        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's concerns about the domain vistomail.com, stating that it hasn't changed hands since he registered it. He clarified that the purchase update on who.is was simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Satoshi criticized Peter for his smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, urging him to stop arguing and work harder. He also mentioned that he added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and falsely claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin.Satoshi claimed to have many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but stated that he never cared because he knows he is the real one. He revealed that he has seen all the messages, including Peter's, and added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. Satoshi commended the Lightning team for their great work and thanked them for making him feel welcomed.In response to Satoshi's email, Peter Todd pointed out that the whois records and website content of vistomail.com had recently changed, suggesting that the domain may have been taken over by scammers pretending to be Satoshi. He suggested blocking the entire domain from the list.Overall, Satoshi Nakamoto expressed his satisfaction with the Lightning Network and its ability to facilitate global business through fast and secure lightning payments. However, concerns were raised about the ownership of the vistomail.com domain, leading to discussions about potential scammers impersonating Satoshi.</p>
