        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's statement about the domain vistomail.com, clarifying that it hasn't changed hands since he registered it. He explained that the purchase update on who.is was simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Satoshi expressed his frustration with the constant arguments and smart ass comments on Twitter, urging people to stop arguing and work harder. He also mentioned that he added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to counter Craig Wright's attempts to sue everyone and claim to be the creator of Bitcoin.Satoshi further stated that he has many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never felt the need to do so because he knows he is the real one. He revealed that he saw all the messages, including Peter's, and added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com to give a compliment to the Lightning team for their great work. He thanked them for making him feel welcomed.In response to Satoshi's email, Peter Todd pointed out that the whois records and website content of vistomail.com were recently changed, indicating a change in ownership. He suggested blocking the entire domain from the list, assuming it to be another scammer pretending to be Satoshi.Overall, the email exchange between Satoshi Nakamoto and Peter Todd revolved around the Lightning Network's achievements, Satoshi's lightning address, concerns about the ownership of vistomail.com, and the ongoing debate about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
