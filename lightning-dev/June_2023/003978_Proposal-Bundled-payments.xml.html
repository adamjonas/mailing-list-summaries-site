    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin, founder of Electrum Wallet, has proposed an extension to the BOLT-11 protocol for Lightning Network payments, which would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The proposal is aimed at non-custodial exchanges such as submarine swaps and JIT channels that require a prepayment of mining fees before the exchange can occur. Currently, service providers ask for a prepayment or preimage of the main payment before clients can claim it, making them custodian and exposing them to European MICA regulation. The proposed change would allow both payments to be bundled in the same invoice, leveling the field between lightning service providers and making pay-to-open services fully non-custodial. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages, and implementation is suggested through BOLT-11 rather than BOLT-12 or onion messages.</p>
