        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>LNbits team discovered an exploit that enables attackers to create balances out of thin air by abusing a quirk in how invoices are handled internally. The attacker was able to insert a bolt-11 payment hash of payment A into a different payment creating a malicious invoice B that can trick the backend into believing that B == A. LNbits patched this and urges users to update as soon as possible. The attack involves a fundamental understanding of bolt-11 and requires custom tooling to produce the malicious invoice. The "payment hash" of an invoice is not a "payment" hash but merely a "preimage" hash â€“ and nothing else. The mitigation is quite simple. Backends should either use self-generated unique "checking id's" for looking up internal payments or use additional checks to make sure that the invoice details have not been messed around with.</p>
