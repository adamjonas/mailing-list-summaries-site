    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is centered around the proposed HTLC endorsement system and its effectiveness in mitigating jamming attacks on the Lightning network. There is a discussion about how the compensation mechanism works in the chain of nodes with high reputation and whether the HTLC endorsement system suffers from classic issues of reputation systems such as whitewashing. The proposed system guarantees that if a node is jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening, but there is no claim about who pays or the cost of the attack. The discussion continues with concerns about the coupling effect introduced between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of endorsement schemes. The conversation concludes with a suggestion to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis and caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that could provoke more harm than relief to routing node operators.</p>
