    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential to develop local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that it is not usual to publicly announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit due to the desire for serenity in engineering conversations and to avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, he believes that given the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, it is better to announce it well in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his proposal, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He encourages open communication and actions rather than mere words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the LN Summit organization. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between different generations of contributors.Antoine concludes by mentioning that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, giving him operational templates to work with for the LN Summit in Africa.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together Lightning developers in Africa to leverage the continent's potential and foster the growth of local Lightning economies.</p>
