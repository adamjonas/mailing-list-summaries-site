    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Thomas and Bastien, they discuss the possibility of combining pre-payment of mining fees with 0-conf and whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Bastien explains that a TLV field needs to be added to Bolt 12 invoices or onion messages for bundled payments to work with it. They also discuss the adoption rate of BOLT-12 as a dominant payment method on Lightning and the goal of leveling the playing field for lightning service providers. In a separate email, David proposes an idea to use a keysend payment with metadata instead of a BOLT11 invoice for prepayments, which could potentially reduce the size of the invoice. Thomas explains that a feature bit is still needed for the receiver to decide if prepayment is optional or required, and provides an example of how it would work. Overall, they emphasize the importance of building a cleaner solution on top of Bolt 12 rather than rushing to implement it on Bolt 11.</p>
