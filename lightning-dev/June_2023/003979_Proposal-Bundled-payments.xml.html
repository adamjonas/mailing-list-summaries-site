    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list post, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow for two bundled payments in one invoice. This would benefit services that require prepayment of mining fees, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, these services require prepayment due to the lack of guarantee that clients will claim payments. However, competitors who do not have dedicated wallets are vulnerable to DoS attacks. By bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same invoice, service providers can protect themselves against mining fee attacks without becoming custodian. It would also enable competition between lightning service providers by removing the need for dedicated client software. Boltz is currently distributing a Progressive Web App that separates the submarine swap client from the user's lightning wallet, which enables competition. However, it is unclear whether their app is doing everything correctly. Lightning Loop could benefit from this separation by distributing an app that does not require a local LND instance. There is an ongoing standardization effort for LSP protocols, and Boltz is working to add submarine swaps to it.</p>
