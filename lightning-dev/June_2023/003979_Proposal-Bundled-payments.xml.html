    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Thomas Voegtlin, founder of Electrum wallet, has proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts in a single invoice. The proposal is aimed at services that require the prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodial exchanges such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. According to Voegtlin, it would enable competitors to offer these services without requiring a dedicated client. However, the proposal does not prevent service providers from stealing the pre-payment. Ongoing standardization efforts for LSP protocols are also underway, including submarine swaps. Separating the submarine swap client from the user's lightning wallet could enable competition and increase potential user bases.</p>
