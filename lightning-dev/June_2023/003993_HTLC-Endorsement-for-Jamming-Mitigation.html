    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation, the issue of compensation for damage inflicted by jamming traffic in the Lightning Network was discussed. The concern raised was whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully economically compensate the victims. It was acknowledged that the only observable damage in the protocol is routing fees. To address this, it was suggested that different thresholds could be set based on node preferences.The difficulty of gaining reputation was noted to be proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. This indicates that the compensation system takes into account the impact of an attack on a victim. However, it was pointed out that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers.The lack of a formal definition of the problem and the required correctness conditions for a solution were highlighted. The "unjamming lightning" paper, although claiming to systematically analyze the solution space, does not provide a formalized problem definition independent of the adopted solution. It was emphasized that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, require rigorous evaluation similar to modern cryptanalysis.To provide measurable bounds to any solution, a rigorous analysis is necessary. Parameters such as channel opening default need to be carefully considered, and adversaries should not have access to superior sources of information to launch jamming attacks that are not adequately compensated. While proving theorems may be challenging due to criteria like user experience and ease of implementation being subjective, simulations are being conducted to assess quantifiable criteria.It was suggested that simulations should also evaluate how HTLC endorsement can potentially downgrade HTLC routing traffic, considering its potential impact on link-level liquidity. The conversation concluded with the mention of ongoing simulations and the acknowledgment that mitigating DDoS attacks, like jamming, is notoriously difficult, but efforts are being made to address them in the Lightning Network using available tools.</p>
