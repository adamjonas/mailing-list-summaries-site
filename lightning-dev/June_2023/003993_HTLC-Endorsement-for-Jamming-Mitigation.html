    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, the issue of compensating routing nodes for damage inflicted by jamming attacks was raised. The concern was whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully economically compensate for the harm caused to victims. The protocol only currently observes routing fees, but it is suggested that different thresholds could be implemented based on node preferences.The difficulty of gaining reputation is directly proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. This raises questions about the nature of compensation in terms of proportional ratios between fees and reputation. It is also unclear whether the evaluation criteria for dynamic ratios are static or dynamic themselves.There is a contradiction between outlawing the cost of attacks and the proposed htlc endorsement design goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The focus should be on compensating the victim rather than penalizing the attacker, as their pockets may be deep.It is noted that the "Unjamming Lightning" paper lacks a formal definition of the problem and the required correctness conditions for a solution. To accurately evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution, rigorous analysis similar to modern cryptanalysis is needed. Without such analysis, measurable bounds cannot be established, and subtle parameter modifications may result in ineffective solutions.While simulations are being conducted to assess the impact of htlc endorsement on link-level liquidity, it is acknowledged that DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate. Despite the limitations, efforts are being made to optimize lightning network tools.In conclusion, more research and analysis are required to determine the best approach to compensating routing nodes and mitigating jamming attacks effectively.</p>
