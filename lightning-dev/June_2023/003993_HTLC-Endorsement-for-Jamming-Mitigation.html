    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The sender of the email is seeking clarification on the proposed htlc endorsement system and how it economically compensates for the damage caused by jamming attacks. They question whether the fees paid fully compensate for the inflicted damage and whether the compensation is proportional or static. They also mention that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the design goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The sender expresses the need for a formal definition of the problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation, as well as the correctness conditions required for a solution. They believe that there is an undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, in the financial cryptography/computer security literature. They suggest evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.The sender highlights the difficulty in giving measurable bounds to any solution without a rigorous analysis and mentions the need for simulations to evaluate the impact of htlc endorsement on link-level liquidity. They acknowledge the challenge of mitigating DDoS attacks and state that they are doing their best within the context of lightning using available tools.In response to the sender's concerns, the recipient states that they are working on simulations to assess the impact of htlc endorsement on HTLC routing traffic. They mention that criteria such as user experience and ease of implementation make it difficult to prove theorems. They also note that DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate.Overall, the sender is seeking more clarity and rigorous analysis regarding the proposed htlc endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for jamming attacks.</p>
