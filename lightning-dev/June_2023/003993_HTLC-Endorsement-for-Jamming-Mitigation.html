    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation, the topic of compensating routing nodes for damage inflicted by jamming traffic in a potential attack was discussed. The concern raised was whether the fees paid to the routing node would fully compensate for the damage suffered by the victim. It was pointed out that the only observable damage in the protocol is routing fees. The suggestion was made to have different thresholds for receiving nodes based on their preferences.The question of proportional compensation and the evaluation criteria for determining the ratio between fees and reputation was also raised. It was mentioned that the difficulty to gain reputation is directly proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system was seen as contradictory to the goal of having a significant cost to persistent attackers. The focus should be on compensating the victim rather than punishing the attacker.The lack of a formal definition of the problem and the correctness conditions required for a solution were pointed out. The "unjamming lightning" paper, which claims to systematically analyze the solution space, does not provide a formalized problem definition. It was suggested that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without rigorous analysis, it would be difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine when there is a failure due to modifying parameters like channel opening defaults. Additionally, adversaries could exploit superior sources of information to launch jamming attacks where the sum paid does not cover the operational cost of a routing hop. Simulations are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of potential solutions.The fluctuation of link-level liquidity caused by HTLC endorsement was acknowledged, and simulations are currently underway to assess its impact on HTLC routing traffic. It was noted that DDoS attacks, like jamming attacks, are notoriously challenging to mitigate. Therefore, the team is doing their best within the context of Lightning using the available tools.Overall, further analysis and simulations are being conducted to address the concerns raised and ensure that any solution is effective in mitigating jamming attacks.</p>
