    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation revolves around the topic of jamming attacks in the context of the Lightning Network protocol. The author raises concerns about the economic compensation provided to routing nodes for the damage caused by such attacks. They question whether the proposed HTLC endorsement system adequately compensates the victim for the inflicted damage.In response, it is mentioned that the only observed damage in the protocol is routing fees. It is suggested that different threshold options can be chosen based on a node's preference. Suggestions for receiving nodes are also provided.The author continues to inquire about the proportional compensation and the criteria used for evaluation. In reply, it is stated that the difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. The focus is on compensating the victim rather than outlawing the cost of the attack.The author expresses their uncertainty regarding the precise problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation and the lack of formal definition and correctness conditions in the "unjamming lightning" paper. They believe that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming attacks, require rigorous analysis similar to modern cryptanalysis.The importance of evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with conceptual rigor is emphasized. Without such analysis, it is challenging to set measurable bounds or determine when there is a wreckage due to modifications in parameters like channel opening default. The presence of superior sources of information for adversaries to launch jamming attacks where the sum paid does not cover the operational cost of a routing hop is also highlighted.It is acknowledged that proving theorems is difficult due to many "soft" criteria related to user experience and ease of implementation. Simulations are being conducted to evaluate quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice. The difficulty of mitigating DDoS attacks is mentioned as well.The conversation concludes with a suggestion to simulate how the HTLC endorsement system might impact HTLC routing traffic, considering its potential to fluctuate link-level liquidity.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for further analysis and evaluation of jamming mitigation solutions in the Lightning Network protocol. The authors emphasize the importance of rigorous analysis and simulations to assess the effectiveness of proposed solutions.</p>
