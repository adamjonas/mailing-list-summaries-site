    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be addressed with a compatible payment protocol, and the continent's energetic demography. Antoine also mentions the increasing number of Lightning developers from Africa and the potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is typically not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, he believes it is best to announce it ahead of time. He suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites any objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He encourages feedback in public or private regarding his role. Additionally, he plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit. Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria are among the countries mentioned. Antoine intends to share his findings privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.To facilitate communication about the LN Summit 2024, Antoine has established a dedicated email address: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He also welcomes Lightning Network developers to join the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.</p>
