    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and potential for a compatible payment protocol. The continent also boasts a growing number of Lightning developers and opportunities to develop local Lightning economies.While the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events is typically not announced on open communication channels, Antoine believes it is necessary this time due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather. He emphasizes the need for transparency and fairness in the process, suggesting a multi-stakeholder approach with various individuals contributing to ensure sufficient financial resources and accountability.Antoine welcomes any objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing LN Summit 2024, encouraging open communication either publicly, on the provided thread, or via email. He pledges to uphold strong transparency and accountability standards, highlighting the importance of actions over words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He will privately share the results, based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics, with Lightning attendees towards the end of the summer.For dedicated communication related to LN Summit 2024, Antoine has set up an endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He also encourages other LN developers to join the organization, viewing it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes by mentioning that he previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and already has operational templates in place.</p>
