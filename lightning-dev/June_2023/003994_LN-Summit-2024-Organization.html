    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, growing number of Lightning developers, and potential for developing local Lightning economies. While usually the organization of such events is not announced on open communication channels, Antoine feels that it is necessary this time due to the complexity of operational challenges, such as visa travels and tropical weather. He suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. He values transparency and accountability and is open to suggestions via public or private communication. To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability in Africa, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of Lightning contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previous experience in organizing events, having co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.</p>
