    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its natural beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of CoreDev or LN Summit is typically not made on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolls or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential complexities involved in organizing an event in Africa, he believes it is best to announce it well in advance. He mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient, but encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community. To start small, he plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that are suitable for hosting the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The results will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.To facilitate communication about the LN Summit 2024, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He also invites Lightning Network developers to reach out if they wish to contribute to the organization, seeing it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring the LN Summit to Africa, leveraging the continent's unique attributes and potential for Lightning network development and adoption.</p>
