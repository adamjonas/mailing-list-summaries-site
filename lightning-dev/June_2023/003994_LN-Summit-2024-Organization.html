    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. There are several reasons for choosing Africa as the location for the summit. Africa is a beautiful continent with a rich cultural and historical past. The financial systems of the 56 states in Africa are fragmented, and implementing a compatible payment protocol like LN could help solve this issue. Additionally, Africa has a young and energetic population, and there is an increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Moreover, there are promising opportunities to develop "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not usually done on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling by BSV fans or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce it far ahead. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites any objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and encourages feedback to be shared publicly or privately. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards and emphasizes the need for actions, rather than mere talk, in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that can accommodate the summit. Some potential locations mentioned include Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for further discussions and invites LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, providing an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. He mentions that he has previous experience in organizing events, having co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.</p>
