    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a vibrant and energetic population, and the growing number of Lightning developers from the continent.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential complexities involved in organizing an event in Africa, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce it well in advance. While operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites anyone who objects to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 to share their concerns publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics, likely towards the end of the summer.To facilitate communication for the LN Summit 2024, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes his message by mentioning that he previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, highlighting his prior experience in event organization.</p>
