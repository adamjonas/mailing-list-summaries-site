    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the summit's location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of the CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not made on open communication channels to maintain a peaceful engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce the event well in advance. He suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes objections or feedback regarding his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit. Countries mentioned include Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will privately share the survey feedback with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer, considering neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes by mentioning his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, indicating that he already has operational templates in place.Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together Lightning developers in Africa for the LN Summit 2024, leveraging the continent's potential, fostering collaboration, and ensuring transparency throughout the process.</p>
