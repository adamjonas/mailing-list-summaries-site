    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa, with its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and growing number of Lightning developers, is an ideal location for the summit. However, he acknowledges that there may be operational challenges, such as visa travels and tropical weather, that need to be addressed. To ensure fairness and transparency, Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach with various individuals contributing to the organization. He welcomes objections or feedback on his involvement in the summit's organization. Antoine emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards and urges participants to speak through their actions rather than mere words.To begin the project, Antoine proposes surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to find a suitable location for the summit. He plans to privately share feedback based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it provides an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions that he has prior experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which gives him operational templates to work with.</p>
