    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky wrote a letter to the bitcoin-dev mail list, but to prevent potential censorship, he sent a CC to the lightning-dev mail list as well. He mentioned that he had previously created valuable contributions to the community and received support from known community members. However, his post was not released while other emails were being published. This led him to question whether his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. Dr. Maxim Orlovsky then shared a conversation on Twitter to highlight the lack of clear moderation policies and the abuse of power by Bryan Bishop. Eventually, the post was published after a requirement from Peter Todd.In light of this incident, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list, which should be discussed and agreed upon by the community. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator and selecting a new moderator based on the criteria of "least votes against" from a list of potential candidates. Thirdly, he emphasized that the role of the moderator should solely be to execute the policies without personal preferences. Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would only be read by those interested in non-censorship auditing of the main mail list. Finally, he suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.Dr. Maxim Orlovsky concluded his letter by restating his case and expressing his hope for improvement in the moderation policies of the bitcoin-dev mail list.You can find the links referenced in the context below:[1]: <a href="https://twitter.com/lnp_bp/status/1664329393131364353?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg[2]:">https://twitter.com/lnp_bp/status/1664329393131364353?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg[2]:</a> <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021554.html[3]:">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021554.html[3]:</a> <a href="https://github.com/LNP-WG[4]:">https://github.com/LNP-WG[4]:</a> <a href="https://github.com/BP-WG[5]:">https://github.com/BP-WG[5]:</a> <a href="https://github.com/mycitadel[6]:">https://github.com/mycitadel[6]:</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-31&to=2022-04-12&type=c[7]:">https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-31&to=2022-04-12&type=c[7]:</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1664515543154544645?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg">https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1664515543154544645?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1664731504923095041?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg[8]:">https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1664731504923095041?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg[8]:</a> <a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/transcript/telaviv2019/wip-storm-layer-2-3-storage-and-messaging[9]:">https://scalingbitcoin.org/transcript/telaviv2019/wip-storm-layer-2-3-storage-and-messaging[9]:</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1664742651835367424?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg">https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1664742651835367424?s=61&t=9A8uvggqKVKV3sT4HPlQyg</a></p>
