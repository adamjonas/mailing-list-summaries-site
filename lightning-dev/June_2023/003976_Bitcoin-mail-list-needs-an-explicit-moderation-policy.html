    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a letter addressed to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern about potential censorship and shared his experience of having his post rejected while others were being published. He observed that there are different rules for creating new topics compared to replying to existing ones. Starting a new topic requires more effort and must pass through moderation filters, whereas replies have fewer requirements. People filter messages by title, so introducing a new topic might upset those uninterested in it. However, gradually redirecting the discussion from an existing topic is easier because the moderator can change the title. The main reason for moderation is to ensure the quality of content and justify the introduction of new topics.Dr. Orlovsky mentioned that he had previously contributed to the bitcoin community and received support from known members. Despite this, his post was not published initially, leading him and his colleagues to question whether it had reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. After discussing the issue on Twitter, it became apparent that the bitcoin-dev mailing list lacks clear moderation policies and that Bryan Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. Eventually, the post was published after intervention from Peter Todd.To address these issues, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, the bitcoin-dev mailing list should adopt a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy, which can be discussed and agreed upon by the community. Secondly, Bryan Bishop, who had been acting as the moderator, should be appreciated for his work but replaced by a new moderator selected based on the "least votes against" criteria. The role of the moderator should strictly adhere to the policies without personal preferences. Additionally, a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" should be created, where all submissions are published without moderation. This list would primarily serve as an auditing mechanism for the main bitcoin-dev mailing list, and any cases of non-spam emails being censored can be publicly announced to hold failing moderators accountable. Lastly, the incentive for working as a moderator should be reputation-based.In conclusion, Dr. Orlovsky raised concerns about potential censorship and lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He proposed solutions to improve transparency and fairness in the moderation process, ensuring that legitimate content is not censored based on personal preferences.</p>
