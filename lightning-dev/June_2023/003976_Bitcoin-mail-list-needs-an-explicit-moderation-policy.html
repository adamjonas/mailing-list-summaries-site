    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky sent a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. The post received support from known community members like Giacomo Zucco and had no scam promotion. However, the post was not released the next day while other emails were being published. This led Dr. Orlovsky to question whether his post reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator.Dr. Orlovsky then provided a Twitter conversation (Annex A) to highlight the issue he wanted to address in his email. The conversation revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies and that Bryan Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. The post was only published after a requirement from Peter Todd.In light of these events, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list, which could be discussed and agreed upon within the community. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator with someone selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against." Thirdly, he emphasized that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive, without personal preferences influencing their actions. Additionally, Dr. Orlovsky proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would serve as a platform for auditing the main bitcoin-dev mail list and highlighting any instances of non-spam emails being censored. Lastly, he suggested making the incentive to work as a moderator reputation-based.Dr. Orlovsky concluded his email by restating his case and expressing his hope for a resolution to the moderation issues on the bitcoin-dev mail list.The links provided throughout the email offer additional information on Dr. Orlovsky's contributions to the Bitcoin community and the reactions to his post.</p>
