    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed his concerns about potential censorship and lack of clear moderation policies. He mentioned that despite his previous contributions to the community and support from known members, his recent post referencing the new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published while other emails were released. Dr. Orlovsky noticed that there are fewer requirements for replies to existing topics compared to starting new ones. He shared his observation that creating a new topic can lead to rejection if it is not of interest to certain readers. However, if the discussion gradually moves from an existing topic to a new one, the title will be changed by a moderator, making it easier to navigate the conversation.Dr. Orlovsky then detailed a conversation over Twitter with Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the bitcoin-dev mailing list. From this exchange, it became apparent that the mailing list lacks clear explicit moderation or peer-review policies. It was also suggested that Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. The post was only published after Peter Todd's intervention. In light of this, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several changes:1. Implement clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies for the bitcoin-dev mailing list.2. Replace Bryan Bishop as the moderator and select a new moderator from a list of potential candidates using the criteria of "least votes against."3. Ensure that the role of the moderator(s) is purely executive, without personal preferences influencing their actions.4. Create a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions are published without moderation. This list would allow interested individuals to audit the main mailing list for non-censorship. If non-spam emails are found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) should be replaced.5. Establish a reputation-based incentive for working as a moderator.In conclusion, Dr. Orlovsky emphasized the need for clear moderation policies and restated his proposals. He signed off the email with kind regards.To support his claims, Dr. Orlovsky provided links to various references, including tweets about his previous contributions, the new protocol, and the conversation with Bryan Bishop. These links can be used to gather more information and context related to the issues discussed in the email.</p>
