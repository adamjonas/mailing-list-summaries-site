    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community, wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from known community members and having a legitimate post, his email was not published. Dr. Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator, Bryan Bishop. He proposed implementing a clear moderation policy, replacing Bishop as the moderator, and creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list for non-censored submissions. The incentive to work as a moderator would be reputation-based. Dr. Orlovsky shared the core of the conversation on Twitter to highlight the problem. Annex A provides snippets of the conversation, showcasing the lack of clear moderation policies. Dr. Orlovsky concludes his email by restating his case. The email includes various links to additional information and references to his previous contributions to the bitcoin community.</p>
