    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed his concerns about potential censorship and lack of clear moderation policies on the list. He mentioned that he had previously sent a post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol which had received positive responses from the community. Despite being an established contributor to the Bitcoin ecosystem, his post did not get published while others did. This prompted him to question if his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. Dr. Orlovsky shared a Twitter conversation (Annex A) where it became evident that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear moderation or peer-review policies. He accused Bryan Bishop of abusing his powers as a moderator based on personal preferences. Eventually, the post was only published after Peter Todd's intervention. To address these issues, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several solutions. First, he suggested implementing clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Second, he recommended replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator with someone selected from a list of potential candidates based on "least votes against." Third, he emphasized that moderators should strictly follow the policies without personal biases. Lastly, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would allow interested individuals to audit the main bitcoin-dev mail list for non-censorship. If any non-spam emails were found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) would be replaced. Dr. Orlovsky concluded his post by stating that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. He provided links to relevant sources supporting his credibility and expertise in the Bitcoin community.</p>
