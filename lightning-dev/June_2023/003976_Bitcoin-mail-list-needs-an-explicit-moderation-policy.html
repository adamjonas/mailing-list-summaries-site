    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed his concern about potential censorship and sent a copy to the lightning-dev mail list as well. He mentioned that he had previously contributed to the community and received support from known members. However, he noticed that his recent post did not get published while other emails were released. This led him to question whether his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. Dr. Orlovsky highlighted his conversation with Bryan Bishop on Twitter, where it became clear that there were no clear explicit moderation policies for the bitcoin-dev mail list. He accused Bryan of abusing his powers based on personal preferences. Eventually, the post was published after a requirement from Peter Todd. To address this issue, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. He also recommended replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator and selecting a new moderator based on the least votes against them. The role of the moderator should be purely executive, without any personal preferences. Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" that would publish all submissions without moderation, allowing interested individuals to audit the main mail list for non-censorship. If any non-spam emails were found to be censored, the failing moderators would be removed and replaced. Lastly, Dr. Orlovsky suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.In conclusion, Dr. Orlovsky brought attention to the lack of explicit moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator on the bitcoin-dev mail list. He proposed solutions to ensure transparency and fairness in the moderation process.</p>
