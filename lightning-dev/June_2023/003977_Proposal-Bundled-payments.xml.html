    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ThomasV has proposed an extension to BOLT-11, where an invoice can contain two bundled payments, with distinct preimages and amounts. The use case is for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place such as Submarine swaps and JIT channels. In both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC for which they do not have the preimage, have to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address), and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. The proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, you need to use a dedicated client in order to use Loop, and competitors who do not have an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack. ThomasV believes this change should be implemented in BOLT-11, and not using BOLT-12 or onion messages.In the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack need to ask the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. A service that asks for the preimage first becomes custodian. From a legal perspective, it does not matter whether they open the channel immediately after receiving the preimage, the ordering of events makes their service custodian. In Europe, such a service will fall within the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from that game. In the case of submarine swaps, services that use dedicated client software, such as Loop by Lightning Labs, can ask for a prepayment, because their software can handle it (this is called "no show penalty" on the Loop website). However, competitors who do require a dedicated wallet, not such as the Boltz exchange, cannot do that. ThomasV believes his proposal would benefit ACINQ, as it would make it possible for them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. ThomasV's proposed semantics of bundled payments includes the BOLT-11 invoice containing two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before they fulfill the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a MPP timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment, and they broadcast their on-chain transaction.</p>
