    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email, ZmnSCPxj provides a mathematical demonstration of a method for computing blinding factors in a way that ensures:- Non-Trampoline intermediate nodes only need to know one blinding factor.- The receiver only needs to know one blinding factor.- Trampoline nodes can provide the blinding factors for the sub-routes without the non-Trampoline intermediate nodes knowing they are on a trampoline.The demonstration starts with the ultimate receiver having a secret `r` and giving the ultimate sender the point `R = r * G`, where `G` is a constant. In the simplest case where the ultimate sender is directly connected to the ultimate receiver, the ultimate sender chooses a random scalar `e`, constructs an onion with `e` encrypted for the receiver, and offers a PTLC (Payment Tokenized Lightning Contract) with the point `e * G + R`. The ultimate receiver can claim the PTLC by revealing `e + r`.If there is an intermediate node, Carol, between the ultimate sender and the ultimate receiver, the ultimate sender still chooses a random scalar `e`, but it also generates two scalars, `c` and `d`, such that `c + d = e`. The ultimate sender encrypts `e` for the ultimate receiver and `d` for Carol. Each non-Trampoline intermediate node adds its per-hop blinding factor times `G` to the input point and sends the updated point to the next hop. The ultimate receiver cannot differentiate whether it received the PTLC from Carol or a direct source-to-destination route since it sees `e * G + R` in both cases.If Carol is a Trampoline node and the ultimate sender does not provide a detailed route from Carol to the next Trampoline hop, the ultimate sender selects a random `e`, computes `c` and `d` such that `c + d = e`, and creates a Trampoline-level onion with `e` encrypted for the ultimate receiver and `d` encrypted for Carol. Carol decrypts the onion, searches for a route to the next Trampoline hop, and creates a new onion with `b` encrypted for Alice. Alice decrypts the onion, forwards the PTLC to the next hop, and the ultimate receiver receives the PTLC with the same `e * G + R` value as in the previous cases.In claiming the PTLC, every intermediate node has enough data to claim its incoming PTLC, but only the ultimate sender knows `c` to recover `r`.Overall, this mathematical demonstration shows a way to compute blinding factors that allows for efficient routing without compromising privacy or requiring multiple blinding factors to be known by different nodes in the network.</p>
