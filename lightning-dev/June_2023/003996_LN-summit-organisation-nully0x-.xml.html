    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposes to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its cultural diversity, fragmented financial systems, growing number of Lightning developers, and potential for local Lightning economies. Typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity. However, given the operational challenges involved, such as visas and tropical weather, it is best to announce the event well in advance. The organization would benefit from a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency. Antoine welcomes objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards. The first step towards organizing the event would be to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations. Antoine plans to share this information privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. He has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024. LN developers are encouraged to reach out and be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.</p>
