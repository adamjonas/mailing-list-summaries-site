    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by Antoine Riard to organize next year's LN (Lightning Network) Summit in Africa, somewhere in June 2024. He cites the many reasons for holding a summit in Africa, such as its rich cultural and historical past, financial system fragmentation, explosive demography, and local Lightning economies. He also acknowledges the operational challenges that may arise due to visas travels and "tropical weather". Hence, he proposes that it be announced far ahead of time to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. Antoine suggests starting small by surveying African countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. He will share the feedback privately to attendees based on neutral and technical proof-of-work heuristics at the end of summer. To make this event successful, Antoine invites all LN developers who want to be part of the organization to reach out. This is an excellent opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He recommends connecting with communities across Africa that organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, such as Qala Africa and a couple of BitDevs community across a couple of East and West African countries. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone who wants to contribute to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. It is noteworthy that the CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not announced on open communication channels, given the goal of serenity of the engineering conversation and to avoid being trolled by BSV fans or tabloid-style journalism. However, Antoine believes that given the complexity of the operational challenges, it is better to have this announced far ahead.</p>
