    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email from Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, was sent to clarify that the domain vistomail.com hasn't changed hands since he registered it. The purchase update (added years) on who.is was made recently because the domain was set to expire. Satoshi also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as Lightning addresses just so Craig Wright can stop trying to sue everyone and pretend he is the creator of Bitcoin. He complimented the Lightning team for their work and thanked them for making him feel welcomed. Satoshi also stated that he has many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi, but he never cared because he knows he is. Peter was criticized for his smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter. Satoshi saw all the messages including Peter's and added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com.</p>
