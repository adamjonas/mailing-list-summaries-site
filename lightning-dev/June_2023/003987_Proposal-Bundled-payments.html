    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the semantics of bundled payments in relation to BOLT-11 invoices. Thomas suggests that the invoice should have a feature bit to allow the receiver to decide whether prepayment is optional or required. He also mentions that if the prepayment is optional, the main payment amount should be reduced by the prepayment amount. In an example provided by Thomas, Alice expects to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash, along with a prepayment of 10k sats via keysend.David, in response, asks if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload indicating the payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and could be encoded in existing fields like the description or metadata field. This implementation could be used until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.The email exchange took place between Electrum Technologies GmbH, located in Berlin, Germany.</p>
