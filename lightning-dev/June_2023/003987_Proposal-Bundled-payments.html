    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Dave and Thomas are discussing the idea of using bundled payments in BOLT11 invoices. Dave suggests using a keysend payment for the prepayment instead of including a payment hash in the invoice. This would allow the receiver to associate the prepayment with the main payment using metadata. Thomas agrees that this approach could work and mentions that if the feature is optional, the prepayment amount would need to be subtracted from the main payment amount. He provides an example where Alice expects to receive either 1 BTC or 1 BTC minus 10k sats as the main payment, along with the respective payment hashes. Dave suggests extending the BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and allow for immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.</p>
