    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the semantics of bundled payments in relation to BOLT-11 invoices. Thomas suggests that the invoice should have a feature bit so that the receiver can decide whether prepayment should be optional or required. He notes that for the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount needs to be subtracted from the main payment amount. In an example scenario, Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash, along with 10k sats sent via keysend with the prepayment hash.David asks if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment instead of a payment hash in the BOLT11 invoice. This would involve sending the prepayment amount via keysend with metadata indicating which payment hash to associate it with. He suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which could be encoded in existing fields like the description or metadata field.The email exchange concludes with the contact information of Electrum Technologies GmbH, including their address and legal information.</p>
