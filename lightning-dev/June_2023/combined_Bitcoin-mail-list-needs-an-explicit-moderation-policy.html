        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Maxim Orlovsky, a prominent contributor to the bitcoin community, recently raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. He had sent a post referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol but noticed that his post was not published while others were. Orlovsky and his colleagues questioned whether his post had reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that the mail list lacked explicit moderation policies and that Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including implementing clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies, replacing Bishop as the moderator, and creating an unmoderated mail list for non-censored submissions. Orlovsky also suggested that the role of the moderator should be purely executive, without any personal biases, and that reputation-based incentives should be considered for moderators. Orlovsky provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</p>
