        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Maxim Orlovsky, a well-known contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, recently sent a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from community members and being a reputable contributor, his post was not published the next day while other emails were released on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started questioning whether his post ever reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. This led to a conversation on Twitter, which revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies that should be applied non-selectively. It was also discovered that Bishop had abused his powers as a moderator based on personal preferences.In response to these issues, Orlovsky proposed several solutions. First, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates based on the "least votes against" criteria. Thirdly, Orlovsky emphasized the importance of moderators strictly adhering to the policies without any personal preferences. Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would be read by people interested in auditing the bitcoin-dev main mail list for non-censorship. If any non-spam emails were found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) would be removed and replaced. Lastly, Orlovsky suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.To prevent potential censorship, Orlovsky sent his list to the bitcoin-dev mail list and included CC to the lightning-dev mail list. In his email, he provided links to his previous works, such as RGB smart contracts and rust lightning implementation named LNP, as well as links to the Twitter conversation for reference.The annex A shared by Orlovsky included comments from other moderators reviewing his submission on the bitcoin-dev mail list. Bishop responded to Orlovsky's allegations and questioned the validity of the claims. He also mentioned that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. Bishop further explained that his request to stop tagging him on quantum woo may have led Orlovsky to attribute malice to him. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and that he is only interested in hearing about relevant topics.</p>
