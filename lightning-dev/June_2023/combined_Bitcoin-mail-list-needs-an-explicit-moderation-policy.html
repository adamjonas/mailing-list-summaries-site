        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent mailing list for developers, Dr Maxim Orlovsky expressed concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list. He noted that his post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published until Peter Todd required it. Orlovsky accused Bryan Bishop, the current moderator, of abusing his powers to push his own agenda based on personal preferences. To support his claims, Orlovsky shared a Twitter conversation as annex A, which involved comments from other moderators reviewing his submission.Orlovsky, a well-known contributor to the bitcoin community with various software developments, highlighted that while his post received support from community members like Giacomo Zucco, it was not published while other emails were. This led Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association to question whether Bishop had intentionally overlooked his post. The subsequent Twitter conversation revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear and explicit moderation policies that should be applied consistently to all submissions. It also showcased Bishop's alleged abuse of power.To address these issues, Orlovsky proposed a series of solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator who would be selected based on the fewest votes against them. Thirdly, Orlovsky emphasized that the role of the moderator(s) should strictly adhere to the established policies without any personal preferences. Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," where all submissions would be published without moderation. This unmoderated list would allow interested individuals to audit the main bitcoin-dev mail list for censorship. Lastly, Orlovsky believed that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.Orlovsky concluded his message by presenting his case and expressing his hope for the implementation of these proposals. He provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for further reference.</p>
