        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Orlovsky clarified that he was not expecting Bishop to help him, but rather openly declare a moderation or peer review policy and follow it. He criticized the lack of an explicit moderation policy in the bitcoin-dev mail list and compared it to a mistake made with rust-bitcoin over a year ago. Orlovsky proposed several solutions to address the issue, including implementing clear moderation policies, replacing Bishop as moderator, creating an unmoderated mail list for all submissions, and making the role of the moderator purely executive without personal preferences. He also suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.In conclusion, Orlovsky highlighted the need for clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list and called for changes to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making. He shared his concerns about the actions of the current moderator and proposed solutions to address the issue. The annex A provided a glimpse into the Twitter conversation between Orlovsky and other moderators, showcasing the problem he wanted to address in his email.</p>
