    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a proposal to extend BOLT-11, Thomas Voegtlin suggests including two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts in an invoice. This is particularly useful for services that require prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges like submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, some services can ask for prepayment due to their dedicated client software, while others cannot because their wallet is agnostic about the swap. For example, the Boltz exchange would find it impractical to show two invoices simultaneously. This leaves them vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees.Similarly, in the case of JIT channels, providers need to protect themselves against mining fee attacks by asking for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. However, this makes them custodians, which has legal implications under European MICA regulation. Competitors like Electrum, who refuse to offer custodian services, are excluded from this game.To address these issues, Voegtlin proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments involve waiting for all HTLCs of both payments to arrive before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the pre-payment is failed with an MPP timeout. Once both payment HTLCs have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction.Voegtlin acknowledges that this proposal does not prevent service providers from stealing the pre-payment but argues that this risk already exists today. Implementing this change in BOLT-11 would level the playing field for lightning service providers, allowing competitors without a dedicated client to avoid mining fee attacks. ACINQ, for example, could make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian, potentially avoiding regulatory challenges under European MICA.Voegtlin believes that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. He argues that the proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be done in a non-interactive way. By bundling payments in invoices, the competition between lightning service providers can be improved without unnecessary complications.</p>
