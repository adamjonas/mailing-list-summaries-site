    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, they discussed the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. Thomas inquired about bundled payments and whether they would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Matt explained that while bundled payments would not work as specified, it is possible to send two payments using a single BOLT12 offer if the sender implements this feature.Matt also mentioned that they plan to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and expressed his willingness to help. Thomas responded positively to this news. They both agreed that it will take time for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, Thomas suggested that if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.Matt raised some concerns regarding the adoption of a new BOLT-11 extension. He explained that starting from scratch with zero implementations and convincing people to care enough to implement it would be challenging. On the other hand, with BOLT-12, a "swap-aware" client would eliminate the need to scan two QR codes or perform any complicated process.Thomas proposed the idea of reverse submarine swap payments to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers. This would allow payments to come from any wallet, although a dedicated client would still be required to verify the redeem script and invoice, and to sweep the funds. Matt admitted that he struggled to see the value in this proposal, as it seemed to cater to a narrow set of requirements where users have an on-chain wallet distinct from their lightning wallet.Overall, the conversation highlighted the potential benefits and challenges associated with implementing BOLT-12 and the possibility of incorporating bundled payments and reverse submarine swap payments into the Lightning network.</p>
