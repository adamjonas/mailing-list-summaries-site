    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation, Thomas Voegtlin, the developer of Electrum, mentioned that BOLT-12 has not been implemented in Electrum yet. He asked whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 would be required. The response was that bundled payments would not work as-specified, but because BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.It was also mentioned that Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months. The idea of BOLT-12 becoming the dominant payment method on Lightning was discussed, with the consensus being that it would take years after its merge for this to happen. On the other hand, if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster. However, it was noted that BOLT-12 already has some momentum, while a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch.The main goal of the proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, it was pointed out that this approach may only make sense for users who have an on-chain wallet separate from their Lightning wallet and if their Lightning wallet does not support splice-out. This requirement was seen as quite narrow.Overall, the discussion highlighted the potential benefits and challenges of implementing bundled payments and the use of BOLT-12 in the context of Lightning service providers.</p>
