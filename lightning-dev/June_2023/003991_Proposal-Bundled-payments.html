    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum, mentioned that Electrum has not yet implemented BOLT-12. He inquired whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if they would require changes to BOLT-12. The response was that as-specified, bundled payments would not work, but since BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments, as long as the sender implements this feature.Voegtlin also mentioned that Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months and offered his assistance in the process. The idea of BOLT-12 becoming the dominant payment method on Lightning was discussed, with the consensus being that it would take years after its merge for BOLT-12 to achieve dominance. On the other hand, if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.The goal of the proposal put forth in the email exchange is to level the playing field between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, it was noted that a dedicated client would still be required to verify the redeem script and invoice, as well as sweep the funds. The value of this proposal was questioned, as it seemed to have a narrow set of requirements, mainly catering to users who have an on-chain wallet distinct from their lightning wallet and do not have support for splice-out in their lightning wallet.Overall, the email exchange highlighted the discussion around implementing BOLT-12 support in Electrum, the potential timeline for BOLT-12 to become dominant, and the proposal for reverse submarine swap payments.</p>
