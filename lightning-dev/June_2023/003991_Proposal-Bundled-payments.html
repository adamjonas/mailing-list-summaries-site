    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on June 20, 2023, Thomas Voegtlin, the developer of Electrum, discussed the implementation of BOLT-12, a Lightning Network protocol, in the Electrum wallet. Voegtlin asked if bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 were needed. The response was that bundled payments would not work as specified, but since BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments if the sender implements this feature.Voegtlin mentioned that BOLT-12 support will be implemented in Electrum in the coming months and expressed willingness to assist with the process. The discussion then shifted to the potential adoption and impact of BOLT-12. It was agreed that it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, there was a suggestion that if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.The proposal put forth aimed to level the playing field among Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, there was some skepticism about the value of this proposal. It was pointed out that although a "swap-aware" client is required for the swap setup and enforcement, any lightning wallet could be used to make the payment. This approach would only make sense if the user has a distinct on-chain wallet they want to use alongside their lightning wallet, and if their lightning wallet does not support splice-out.Overall, the discussion revolved around the implementation and potential impact of BOLT-12 in Electrum, as well as the considerations and challenges associated with bundled payments and increasing competition among Lightning service providers.</p>
