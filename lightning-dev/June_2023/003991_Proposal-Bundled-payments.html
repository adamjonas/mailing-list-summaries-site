    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion, Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum wallet, expressed that they have not yet implemented BOLT-12, a feature in the Lightning Network. He inquired whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 would be necessary. The response was that bundled payments would not work as currently specified, but because BOLT-12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments, provided that the sender implements this functionality.Thomas Voegtlin further mentioned that Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months and is willing to assist in its development. It was acknowledged that even after the implementation of BOLT-12, it would likely take several years for it to become the dominant payment method on the Lightning Network.However, it was suggested that if the proposed feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could potentially be deployed much faster. The reasoning behind this suggestion was that while BOLT-12 still has some way to go, a new BOLT-11 extension would need to start from scratch, convincing developers to implement it.The purpose of Thomas Voegtlin's proposal is to create a level playing field for Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, there were reservations about the value of this proposal, as it would require a "swap-aware" client for setup and enforcement, limiting its usefulness to users with specific requirements such as having a distinct on-chain wallet separate from their Lightning wallet.Overall, discussions regarding the implementation and potential impact of BOLT-12 and alternative approaches in the Lightning Network are ongoing.</p>
