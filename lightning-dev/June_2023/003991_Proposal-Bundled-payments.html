    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, the topic of BOLT-12 implementation in Electrum is discussed. Thomas mentions that they have not yet implemented BOLT-12 in Electrum and asks if bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Matt responds that as specified, bundled payments would not work, but since BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments if the sender implements this feature.Thomas expresses his intention to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offers his assistance in the process. Matt responds positively to this and agrees that BOLT-12 will take time to become the dominant payment method on Lightning.Matt further explains that if the proposed feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead of BOLT-12, it could be deployed faster. He points out that while BOLT-12 has some progress to make, a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch with no implementations currently and would need to convince people to adopt it.Regarding Thomas's proposal of leveling the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet, Matt admits struggling to see the value. He believes that this proposal would only make sense if users have a separate on-chain wallet that they want to use, distinct from their lightning wallet. However, Matt notes that most lightning wallets will likely support splice-out in the future, making this requirement quite narrow.Overall, the discussion revolves around the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum, the potential benefits and challenges associated with bundled payments, and the viability of different proposals to improve the Lightning network.</p>
