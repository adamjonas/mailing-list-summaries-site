    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email response to Peter Todd, Satoshi Nakamoto clarified that the domain vistomail.com has not changed ownership since he registered it and that the recent purchase update on who.is was simply a renewal due to its impending expiration. Additionally, he added satoshin and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses in order to counteract Craig Wright's attempts to sue everyone and pretend to be the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi also mentioned that he has other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never cared to do so because he knows he is the real one. He praised the Lightning team for their great work and complimented them for making him feel welcomed. Satoshi signed off with his public key attached to the email.</p>
