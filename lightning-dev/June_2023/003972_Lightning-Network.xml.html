    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's tweet about the ownership of vistomail.com, clarifying that he never sold the domain and only added years to its ownership. He also added satoshin and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing people and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi complimented the Lightning team for their great work and expressed his satisfaction with the ability of humans to conduct global business and scale with fast and secure lightning payments. Peter Todd assumed that someone else had taken over the domain based on a change in whois records and website content, but Satoshi denied this, adding that he saw all messages, including those of Peter. Satoshi further added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com, thanking the Lightning team for making him feel welcomed.</p>
