    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Satoshi Nakamoto has responded to Peter Todd's tweet about the ownership of the domain vistomail.com. Satoshi said that the domain hasn't changed hands since he registered it and that he added years of ownership recently. He also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to stop Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi also mentioned that he has many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi, but he never cared because he is the real Satoshi. He complimented the Lightning team on their work and said that they are "light years ahead of the traditional banking system". Finally, Satoshi added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com and thanked the Lightning team for making him feel welcomed.</p>
