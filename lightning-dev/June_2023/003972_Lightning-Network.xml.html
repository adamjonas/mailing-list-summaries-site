    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email response from Satoshi Nakamoto to Peter Todd on June 3rd, 2023, Satoshi clarified that the domain vistomail.com had not changed hands since he registered it. He added years of ownership recently because the domain was set to expire. Additionally, he added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to stop Craig Wright from trying to sue everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi claimed to have many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never cared because he knew he was the real one. He complimented the Lightning team for their excellent work on creating a global business with fast and secure lightning payments. Peter Todd had previously expressed concern about Vistomail's change of ownership, which Satoshi dismissed as a purchase update rather than a sale. Finally, Satoshi attached his public key and a digital signature to the email.</p>
