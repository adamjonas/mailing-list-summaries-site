    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's false statements about the domain vistomail.com, clarifying that it hadn't changed hands since he registered it, and that he added years to ownership recently because the domain was set to expire. He added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to stop Craig Wright from pretending he is the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi also complimented the Lightning team on their excellent work and their ability to conduct global business with fast and secure lightning payments. Peter Todd had previously suggested that the domain vistomail.com had changed ownership, but Satoshi refuted this claim. Satoshi also stated that he had many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi, but he never cared because he is the real Satoshi.</p>
