    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list for developers, Dr Maxim Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies after his post was published only after a requirement from Peter Todd. He also accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. Orlovsky's tweets regarding his submission to the bitcoin-dev mail list were shared as annex A, which included comments from other moderators reviewing it. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. He also suspected that Orlovsky may be attributing malice to him because he asked him to stop tagging him on quantum woo. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it.</p>
