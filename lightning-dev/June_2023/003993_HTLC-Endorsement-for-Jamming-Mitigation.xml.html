    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Clara and an individual is centered around the proposed HTLC endorsement system and its potential to compensate for damage inflicted by jamming traffic. The individual asks several questions regarding the compensation system, including whether fees paid are fully economically compensating for the damage inflicted, if the ratio between fees and reputation is dynamic or static, and how reputation is gained. Clara explains that the difficulty in gaining reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. The individual also expresses concerns about the lack of formal problem definition and correctness conditions required for a solution, as well as the need for rigorous analysis of any jamming solution. Clara agrees that more simulations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of any solution, particularly given the difficulty in mitigating DDoS attacks. Finally, there is mention of ongoing simulations to assess the impact of the proposed endorsement system on HTLC routing traffic.</p>
