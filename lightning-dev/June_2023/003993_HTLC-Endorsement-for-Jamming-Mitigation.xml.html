    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about a proposed htlc endorsement system that compensates victims of jamming attacks. The compensation would be in the form of routing fees and the difficulty to gain reputation would be proportional to the amount of damage inflicted. Outlawing the cost of attack from the system goes against the design goal of producing a mitigation that has a significant cost to persistent attackers. There is an undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, and the effectiveness of any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis. Simulations are being run to evaluate how the proposed system might downgrade HTLC routing traffic.</p>
