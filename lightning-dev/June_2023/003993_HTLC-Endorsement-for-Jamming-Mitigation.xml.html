    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is regarding the proposed htlc endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for damage inflicted to victims of jamming attacks. The protocol only observes routing fees as damage, but a different threshold can be chosen based on node preference. The difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage inflicted. Outlawing the cost of an attack from the system would contradict the design goal of producing a mitigation that has a significant cost to persistent attackers. The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are novel in financial cryptography and computer security literature. Further simulations are being run to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution. Since many criteria are "soft", simulations are necessary to see if theory meets practice. DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate, so the team is doing their best in the context of lightning using the available tools. Finally, simulations are being run to determine how the htlc endorsement system might downgrade HTLC routing traffic.</p>
