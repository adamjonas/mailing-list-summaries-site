    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard proposed the organization of the LN Summit in Africa, with a tentative date in June 2024. Africa has a rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, an explosive demography, and more Lightning developers coming from the continent. The announcement was made to Lightning-dev mailing list, where he mentioned that the operational challenges can be complex and better to announce far ahead. He also set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose. Although they usually don't announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, Antoine believes it is necessary due to the complexity of the project. He plans to survey all the countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc., and will share the feedback privately to the Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine invites Lightning devs to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as this is a good opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.</p>
