    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, there is a discussion about changing the core principle of a network regarding an unconditional fee. One person believes that the current principle leaves the network open to attacks and should be changed. However, the other is skeptical because it could make the high-risk class even easier to attack. They suggest having a continuous risk score instead of a binary low/high-risk to mitigate this problem. There is also talk about finding a good formula to compute local reputation for throttling based on reputation. The second person suggests using the proportion of successful payments as a more reliable indicator and doesn't think relying on "A satoshis per second" is wise. They also mention that gaining a good reputation should be difficult and that offering several options for different nodes with different needs and risk preferences would be better than a general default.</p>
