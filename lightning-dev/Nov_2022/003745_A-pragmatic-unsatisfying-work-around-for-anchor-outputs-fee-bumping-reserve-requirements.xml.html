    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the lightning network transaction format, Bastien Teinturier raised concerns about the challenges brought by the introduction of anchor outputs which require nodes to maintain a reserve of available utxos for fee-bumping. This management is complex and requires dynamic risk assessment as nodes may need to fee-bump thousands of HTLC transactions in a short period of time. While HTLC transactions should not require external inputs, decreasing the amount of the corresponding output to set fees to any desired value does not work well with the revocation mechanism without fancy new sighash flags.A solution proposed is for each node to sign multiple versions of the HTLC transactions at various feerates, allowing pre-signed transactions that match the required feerate, reducing the requirements on the on-chain wallet and simplifying transaction management logic. The proposal has been made as a pragmatic approach to increase funds safety for existing node operators and wallets. However, Teinturier also raised concerns about the limitations of this proposal to tackle dusty HTLCs kind of attacks and the complexity it introduces.Bastien has sent an email to the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding the implementation that needs to be provided. He has also shared three links related to the same on Github. The first link is for a pull request numbered 688, the second link is for an issue numbered 845, and the third link is for another pull request numbered 1036.</p>
