    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Clara asks Antoine about the benefits of using a token compared to unconditional fees and local reputation. Antoine suggests that a recommended policy is needed and proposes a simple one that covers full routing fees with zero-jamming risk. He also mentions the use of liquidity value credentials requested in function of local channel congestion rate or network data, which can increase returns in exchange for higher risk exposure. Additionally, he suggests laying on top a reputation layer where scores are fully fungible against monetary credentials. Clara asks about the timeline for presenting such a policy and says she will make inquiries to ensure the phone call works for most people. Antoine suggests refining the proposed credentials architectural framework and thinks dynamic routing policy in function of channel congestion rate combined with reputation to do active risk-management are far more advanced questions.</p>
