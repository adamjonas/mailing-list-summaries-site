    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Core Lightning 0.12.0 release has been announced, named by @adi2011. The update includes several new features for users. This includes a built-in 'bookkeeper' plugin which tracks all movements of msats for your node and gives you a better idea of costs and revenues. In addition to this, the update also has a built-in 'commando' plugin which allows you to create runes to access your node from a commando client and send/receive RPC commands over the lightning network. Emergency channel backup feature has also been added in the update where users can keep track of peers with channels and ask them to close the channel in case of node failure.For developers, the '_msat' fields are added wherever they were missing in the API. The `channel_state_changed` notification now fires when a channel moves into state `CHANNELD_AWAITING_LOCKIN`. In addition to this, `pyln-testing` now includes utilities to read and parse the gossip\_store, and there is M1 architecture support as well.Other updates include preferring IPv6 connections when available, accepting spam gossip and using it for routing but not relaying it, treating LND "internal error" as warnings, and upgrades in bolts implementation for pyln-spec. The release also includes fixes for various crashes and issues, such as those in connectd, multiple log-file options, and signature encoding compliance with BIP-0174.The update has had 508 commits from 31 different contributors over 80 days since v0.11.1. There are nine first-time contributors that have been recognized for their contributions. Docker images are now built with rust plugin `cln-grpc`.</p>
