    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A security alert has been issued regarding various lightning projects which have security issues that could cause loss of funds. The details will be released in four weeks' time, and users are encouraged to upgrade well before then. Certain releases are affected by the CVE, including c-lightning, lnd, and eclair. To avoid risking any funds loss, it is important for users to upgrade to fully patched versions such as lnd v0.7.1, c-lightning v0.7.1, and eclair v0.3.1. It should also be noted that there are still limits in place on the network to mitigate widespread funds loss, and users should keep this in mind when putting funds onto the network at this early stage. If users experience any trouble updating their implementation, developers can be contacted for assistance.</p>
