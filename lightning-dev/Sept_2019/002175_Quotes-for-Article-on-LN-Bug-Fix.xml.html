    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Rusty and Ed Kelso, Rusty admits to the delay in disclosing a security issue in three implementations. According to Rusty, the implementations agreed that it was best to ensure everyone had upgraded before disclosing the problem at all. Given that they found it themselves, it was considered less urgent and 90 days is fairly standard across the industry. However, some people were still caught unaware by the requirement to upgrade, which shows they made the right call in being cautious. Rusty hopes that this experience will make things smoother for the next time they face an upgrade requiring issue.</p>
