    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network developers are discussing the possibility of implementing a mechanism that would allow cooperative channel splicing, which involves a subset of channel parties collectively signing a transaction to remove uncooperative parties. However, this idea is currently considered unsafe, and the proposed solution would require careful design and consideration. Additionally, there is no equivalent concept for multi-party channels, and nodes in such systems may require payment for cooperation. The privacy guarantees for off-chain mechanisms are similar to those for on-chain transactions, but participants would need to honestly claim which UTXOs they want to keep after being kicked out of the membership set. There is also a discussion about possible solutions for liveness issues, including pre-signing updates or creating a new mechanism-within-mechanism layer. However, these potential solutions would require careful consideration and implementation.</p>
