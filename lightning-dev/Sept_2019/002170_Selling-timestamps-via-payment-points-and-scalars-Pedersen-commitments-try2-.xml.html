    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggests a method for providing a timestamp using a zero-knowledge proof that doesn't reveal the secret `r`, but proves the relationship between `x`, `C`, and `R`. Aj asks how to prove that `C = SHA256(x || r)` knowing only `R` and `x`. ZmnSCPxj suggests generating C and R and a generic zkp of the relationship between x, C, and R that doesn't reveal `r`. However, this zkp already proves that C was generated based on `x`, so it provides a timestamp for free. They also discuss a paper that might be relevant, and note that lightning payments are essentially zero-knowledge contingent payments already.</p>
