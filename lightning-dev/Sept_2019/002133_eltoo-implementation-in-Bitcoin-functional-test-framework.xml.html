    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Richard Myers, a member of the Lightning development community, has implemented eltoo update scheme in the Bitcoin functional test framework. The implementation allows exploring the data flow between nodes that use eltoo to update their channel state. The tests were created to have a framework for both understanding and refining the Bitcoin scripts and message passing protocol for eltoo. The simulation uses a fork of Bitcoin with cdeckerâ€™s SIGHASH_NOINPUT patch applied to the signet2 fork fjahr created with patches applied for signet, taproot, and anyprevout*. Bastien Teinturier, another member of the community, asked if anyone had considered first re-writing the Eltoo scripts with miniscript and whether it was the right direction for Eltoo scripts. Miniscript is a scripting language that is more future-proof and extensible than directly using bitcoin script. There are two potential uses for miniscript in lightning: finding optimized bitcoin scripts for a given policy which model the channel and then hardcoding them in lightning backend, and writing customizable conditional-payment than the basic HTLCs. However, implementing on-chain monitoring and resolution would be a real hurdle. Myers plans to add bidirectional channel updates and derive public keys for settle transactions from a pre-shared basepoint in his next steps. He is also looking for other eltoo implementations to compare notes and get the ball rolling on a detailed specification. Myers gives special thanks to the Chaincode Summer Residency and Christian Decker for their helpful advice and encouragement while he worked on this project.</p>
