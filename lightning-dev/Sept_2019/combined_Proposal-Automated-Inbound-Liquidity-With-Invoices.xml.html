        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made to address the problem of waiting for inbound liquidity when first coming online and wanting to receive a Lightning Network payment. The proposed solution is embedding the node URI of the invoice creator, along with the amount to be routed, in the invoice. This would allow Bob's wallet to auto-open a channel and push the payment, allowing the receiver to own and spend the money instantly.However, there are concerns about connecting two end-users this way. Other suggestions include using the fallback tag on BOLT11 invoices or setting up a "temporary" custodian channel if the receiver doesn't have enough inbound capacity. Certain specifics need to be worked out, such as the size of the channel and potential premiums charged by routing nodes who provide this service.ZmnSCPxj recommended a current and practical way to set up incoming liquidity by taking on-chain funds and creating a channel to a high-uptime node on the network and then using a submarine swap to pay off-chain funds to buy on-chain funds. This would require on-chain funds but it provides control over what nodes to make channels with and would be a good investment in future accessibility over the Lightning Network. He also discussed just-in-time routing and trampoline routing, which would greatly aid in implementing this idea. It is still early days, and much infrastructure needs to be written.Another user proposed a way for instant inbound liquidity through invoices by embedding the node URI of the invoice creator along with the amount to be routed, enabling auto-opening of channels and pushing of payment. Routing nodes who provide this service can charge a premium, and Bob, as a liquidity provider, will not cheat against himself so instant payments can be made. The beauty behind this proposal is that it hides everything from the end-user. Until confirmed deeply, the channel opening can still be cancelled by double-spending, thus it would be foolhardy to deliver the product until the channel is deeply confirmed to be opened.The Lightning Network (LN) proposes embedding the node uri of the invoice creator along with the amount to be routed, which suggests establishing auto channels and pushing payments. This proposal aims to help users receive and send payments instantly while hiding everything from them as an end-user. For instance, if Bob wants to send 100,000 sats to a user who has just come online and has no inbound liquidity, the user creates an invoice for 100,000 sats including their URI. The size of Bob's channel and charging premium by routing nodes who provide this service are important considerations. Additionally, the proposal can possibly be extended to neutrino LN wallets if they are public.Overall, the proposals discussed require certain specifics to be flushed out, but they provide different approaches that could solve the problem of waiting for inbound liquidity as a channel establishes. Using Bitcoin as a financial capital store and transportation method is the most sensible way to start this process.</p>
