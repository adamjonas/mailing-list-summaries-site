    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Muun Wallet has implemented a feature that allows users to scan an invoice and open a channel directly if there is not enough capacity in the route to the destination node. However, this feature may not be suitable for all use cases due to time constraints and should only be used for topping up one's own node. There are also challenges with implementing this feature for routing nodes, such as the requirement to remember short-channel-ids for a longer period of time and issues with the final HTLC. To address these challenges, trampoline routing can be used.Push_msat may not provide proof-of-payment, and it should only be used after the channel is confirmed. Muun Wallet believes that investing in manual channel management would be a good investment for future accessibility over the Lightning Network.The email thread discusses a proposal for automated inbound liquidity with invoices on the Lightning Network, which would embed the node URI of the invoice creator along with the amount to be routed. This would allow for auto-establishment of channels and pushing payments, offering instant payment transactions. However, this feature would only be available for routing nodes, and the process remains hidden from users who receive or send payments.For new businesses or merchants looking to set up incoming liquidity, the suggestion is to create a channel to a high-uptime node on the network using on-chain funds, then use a submarine swap to buy on-chain funds. This can be repeated until the provider runs out of on-chain funds or liquidity is sufficient. Using Bitcoin as a financial capital store and transportation method is the most sensible way to start this process. Although fees are involved, this investment gives control over which nodes to make channels with and is a good investment in future accessibility over the Lightning Network.</p>
