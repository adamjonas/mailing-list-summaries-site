        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Konstantin Ketterer, a high school graduate, has proposed a solution for timestamping data using Bitcoin's blockchain. The proposed system involves sending a hash of the message to a timestamping server, which calculates Pedersen commit and builds a merkle tree with other commits. Then, a valid transaction containing the merkle root is published to the Bitcoin blockchain. After a certain number of blocks, the user can confirm that the commitment is part of the blockchain. To prove payment, a lightning payment with C - x*H = r*G as the payment point is sent to the timestamping server. This scheme shifts the risk of timestamping service from the buyer to the seller, who now has to pay the on-chain transaction fee upfront.However, the need for such a paid service seems unnecessary since scalable timestamping services like OpenTimestamps already exist. OpenTimestamps uses giant merkle trees built every second in a scalable way to amortize the cost of BTC transactions across the entire world's timestamps, thus eliminating the need to charge for timestamps. Furthermore, Andrew Poelstra has created an open pull request to add secp256k1 commitments to OpenTimestamps, which could be useful in implementing Konstantin's proposed system.The conversation also discusses a way to timestamp messages without relying on free services or paying high fees. The proposed solution involves buying a place in a Merkle tree "risk-free." To do so, the user sends the hash x of their message to the timestamping server, which then calculates a Pedersen commit, builds a Merkle tree with other commits in it, and publishes a valid transaction containing the Merkle root to the Bitcoin blockchain. After a certain number of block confirmations, the commitment C is confirmed as part of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the user sends a lightning payment with C-x*H=r*G as the payment point to the timestamping server. As proof of payment, the server must reveal r to receive the money.The discussion also touches on using zero-knowledge proofs to timestamp data. ZmnSCPxj suggests a method for providing a timestamp using a zero-knowledge proof that doesn't reveal the secret `r`, but proves the relationship between `x`, `C`, and `R`. Aj asks how to prove that `C = SHA256(x || r)` knowing only `R` and `x`. ZmnSCPxj suggests generating C and R and a generic zkp of the relationship between x, C, and R that doesn't reveal `r`. However, this zkp already proves that C was generated based on `x`, so it provides a timestamp for free. They also discuss a paper that might be relevant, and note that lightning payments are essentially zero-knowledge contingent payments already.</p>
