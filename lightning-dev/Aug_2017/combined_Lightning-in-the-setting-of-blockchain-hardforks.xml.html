        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a mailing list discussion, Martin Schwarz raised concerns about how Lightning can work on distinct permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block. Christian Decker suggested using the first forked block as the forkchain's genesis block while keeping the non-forked blockchain on the original genesis hash to avoid disruption. However, he acknowledged it may become difficult if one chain doesn't declare itself as the forked chain. Channels that are open during the fork would have to settle two and close the channel on the fork, but if replay protection wasn't implemented on the fork, commitments could be used to close the channel. If no replay protection was implemented on the fork, then the last commitment should be used to close the channel. There has been discussion of a standalone "salvage" utility, which would work with any of the implementations to try to get money back. Schwarz also asked if there has been any previous discussion or study of Lightning in the setting of hardforks.</p>
