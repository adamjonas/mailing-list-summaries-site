        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new proposal has been introduced by Olaoluwa Osuntokun, one of the co-authors of the Flare paper, for a protocol to replace the current flood-the-network style route discovery in the Lightning Network. The proposed protocol involves each node knowing its own local network topology and querying a number of connections for routes to the intended destination. This approach aims to reduce the burden on the network in terms of bandwidth and storage space.When a node joins the network, it broadcasts its information and requests local network topology information from all its channels. It gradually fills its cache with information about channels 1 hop beyond its direct connection, then requests topology information for channels 2 hops beyond until its cache is satisfactorily filled. The node also forwards announcement messages from other nodes joining the network to any subscribed nodes within the relevant distance.To construct a route for a transaction, a node checks if it has a path to the desired destination in its cache. If a path is found, the node determines the cost of the cheapest path it has. It then asks all the channels on the edge of its cached local view for their cheapest path, specifying that it only considers paths with a maximum cost equal to or cheaper than the cheapest path it has already found. Once all responses are received, the node constructs the final path.When a node receives a path request from another node, it checks its cache for its cheapest cache-only path. It asks nodes on the edge of its cached local view for their cheapest path, taking into account the maximum cost specified by the requesting node minus the channel cost between them. The node reports the results that satisfy the max-cost requirements of the requesting node.The proposed protocol utilizes an initial routing cache for a neighborhood of nodes. All route information can be encrypted and signed, ensuring relaying nodes cannot read the information and allowing the requesting source node to verify the origin of the information. By keeping both node-announcement messages and route request messages highly localized, the protocol aims to improve network efficiency.Laoluwa Osuntokun acknowledges that multiple routing protocols can be used within the Lightning Network, similar to the internet's eBGP vs iBGP, allowing different sub-graphs to choose protocols that align with their specific goals. The proposed protocol combines reactive and proactive elements, drawing inspiration from Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Fisheye State Routing (FSR), to achieve its objectives. However, Laoluwa suggests exploring more scalable routing protocols, such as distance vector-based algorithms, to further enhance the system.In conclusion, the proposed protocol for route discovery in the Lightning Network focuses on reducing the burden on the network by implementing a more efficient approach that utilizes local network topology information. This protocol keeps both node-announcement messages and route request messages localized, enhancing network performance and scalability.</p>
