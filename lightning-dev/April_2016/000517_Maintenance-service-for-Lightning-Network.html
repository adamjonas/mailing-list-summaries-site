    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kumaigorodskiy Anton has asked for clarification on how routing data works in Lightning Network. However, he is still confused about how an initial payment request can be made. He gives an example of running a Lightning node on his phone and someone knowing his bitcoin-pubkey-style ID only. In response, Rusty suggests providing information via QR code or other means. General messages over the network will not be routed in the short term. A deterministic method to determine which exact node should connect to a given user's ID has been suggested but is long term.Anton also raises concerns about DDoS attacks where it is easy for someone to spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. Rusty agrees that this could be a problem. He suggests mitigating such attacks via requests rationing using blind signatures but is unsure how to enforce it on a distributed network.</p>
