        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion about the clearing process in BOLT #2, Pierre raised concerns regarding contradictions between sections 4.1 and 3.3 of the protocol. Rusty clarified that section 4.1 was intended to delay all responses until receipt of `update_commit`. Section 3.3 stated that a node must check that an ID corresponds to an HTLC in its current commitment transaction.Rusty explained that once a node announces it is shutting down a channel by sending a `close_clearing` message, it cannot accept any more HTLCs. A node can still receive them, but the other node might not have received the `close_clearing` yet.Pierre also expressed concern over the inability to decline an HTLC. Rusty explained that there is no harm in signing an offer, but you are just not going to forward or redeem it. Too-many-htlcs is a protocol violation, which should immediately fail such a connection. Additionally, if a sender of a `close_clearing` message subsequently receives an `update_add_htlc`, there is no way to tell if the other party had received the `close_clearing` prior to sending the HTLC since `update_add_htlc` messages do not have an 'ack' field.Rusty also addressed another issue regarding the signature process. When node A sends an `update_commit` message to B, it expects an `update_revocation` rather sooner than later. However, if B ignores the `update_commit` message and keeps sending new HTLCs, there is no way for A to know if B has received the `update_commit`. Rusty clarified that B can't get more than one step ahead.At some point, it has to send `update_commit` to A, and then A sends `update_revocation`. B can keep sending more HTLCs to A, but it cannot send another `update_commit` because it is not allowed to do so before receiving the previous `update_revocation`.</p>
