    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation about Lightning Network (LN) protocol, Rusty Russell discussed issues with the clearing process as described in BOLT #2. There was a contradiction between ยง4.1 and ยง3.3. The former stated that a node must respond with update_fail_htlc to any HTLC received after it sent close_clearing, while the latter listed three reasons for removing an HTLC: it has timed out, it has failed to route, or the R pre-image is supplied. In this version of the protocol, an HTLC can only be accepted, then committed, then removed, meaning there is no way to decline an HTLC. A sender could only fail the connection instead of declining it. Additionally, if the sender of a close_clearing message subsequently receives an update_add_htlc, there is no way to tell if the other party had received the close_clearing prior to sending the HTLC since update_add_htlc message doesn't have an 'ack' field. To address these issues, Rusty outlined some changes to the protocol. For example, he suggested that 4.1 should say: "A node must fail to route any HTLC received after it sent close_clearing." Also, he added that a node must acknowledge the previous `update_revocation` (if any) in the `update_commit` message. A node should fail the connection if it receives an `update_commit` which does not acknowledge its previously sent `update_revocation`. Lastly, a node must not send out a message with an `ack` field lower than any previous `ack` field.</p>
