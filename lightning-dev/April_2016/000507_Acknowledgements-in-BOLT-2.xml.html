    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the recent introduction of htlc ids in Rusty. The new absolute "lnd-like 64 bits unique id" is preferred over the previous relative "order-I-added-them-in" id. The purpose of this update is to keep track of messages received and restart conversation after a reconnect. The writer suggests that these two cases should be handled differently because they do not happen at the same level. At the protocol level, only the htlc id should be used instead of relying on the acknowledge field. This would make sense since the htlc id is already being used in add/fulfill/fail. However, at the transport level, the acknowledge field should be relied upon to know which messages should be replayed. Although it may seem redundant, this approach clearly separates the transport from the protocol and testing might be easier. The writer also asks the lnd guys about the odd/even htlc ids and whether it's just used to quickly tell the direction of a given htlc or if there's something else.</p>
