        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchange discusses how to handle concurrent signatures during updates. The proposed solution involves using an ordering system to resolve conflicts by comparing signatures and having the node that sent the lesser signature immediately resend a new signature including all pending changes. A diagram is provided to show how nodes track two commitment states, and how they must follow certain rules when processing packets. Rusty Russell explains that as long as an HTLC is committed to by both sides, it's locked in. He also notes that a node must estimate the deadline for successful redemption for each HTLC it offers and should not offer a HTLC past the deadline.In the email exchange, Pierre suggests using an ordering system to resolve conflicts, while Rusty explains a simple rule-based approach involving processing packets in order, updating states when sending or receiving something, and signing a commit tx based on the other side's state at the time. The diagram provided demonstrates the modification of state changes made by nodes during the process, and shows that outstanding changes are acknowledged by sending another SIG, which modifies the other state. Fabrice raises the question of what would happen if both parties decide to send each other a new HTLC instead of immediately sending a new SIG, and whether it could result in an infinite loop where both parties never converge on a commitment tx.</p>
