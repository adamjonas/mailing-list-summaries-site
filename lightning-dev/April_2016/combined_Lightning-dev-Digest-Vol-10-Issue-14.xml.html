        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been made for a Decentralized Service Provider (DSP) to grant end users access to the Lightning Network and offer larger channels, enabling them to send and receive more money. The DSP would consist of geographically distributed entities that manage Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, Lightning Network Channel(s), and communication with end-users and the network. Deposit addresses are multi-sig addresses, requiring a majority of entities to sign withdrawals. This makes it impossible for a single entity of a DSP to steal end-user Bitcoins. Communication between DSP entities and their end-users is through signed messages, providing provability. If an entity acts maliciously, other entities can exclude it from the DSP by moving the managed Bitcoins and channels to new multi-sig addresses/channels that don't require the malicious entity's signature. A hybrid of Bitcoin multisig voting pools, Open Transactions servers, and Interledger-style contracts could be used to fulfill a similar purpose. Fewer blockchain channels would be required with DSPs, as not every end user needs their own channel, resulting in even more space savings on the Blockchain than Lightning alone. However, service providers will need to promote themselves openly as they cannot hide behind TOR or other anonymity measures due to the risk of being exposed to DDoS attacks.</p>
