        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a mailing list conversation, Rusty Russell discusses the use of "landmarks" instead of "beacons" in payment channels. The conversation covers how routing payments via beacons work and whether all payments have to go through the selected beacon nodes. Rusty explains that while some protocols like the pulse protocol are based on beacons to update routing tables, they don't require that all messages go through the beacons. However, messages are routed through the first common ancestor of source and target in the spanning tree associated with the selected beacon, which may result in the source not knowing the route beforehand.Regarding an update strategy for the routing tables, Rusty says they haven't decided yet, but thoughts are welcome. When discussing the two variables that determine the best route (capacity of channels at time t and fees charged by nodes), Rusty suggests that payments are generally smaller than channel capacity and that pricing information is dynamic and needs careful thought. Rusty's current idea involves ratelimiting pricing updates and phasing price changes over time.The conversation also covers false advertising, with Rusty suggesting that you should be able to broadcast the response from a node that refuses to route your payment. If one node signs an invalid message, it can be blacklisted temporarily. Overall, the discussion provides insights into the intricacies of routing payments via beacons and landmarks, and the challenges involved in updating routing tables and managing pricing information.</p>
