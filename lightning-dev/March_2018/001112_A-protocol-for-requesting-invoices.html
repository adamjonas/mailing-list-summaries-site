    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On March 8, 2018, Corn√© Plooy shared an idea on the Lightning-dev mailing list, on how to use Lightning for various types of payments. He proposed a direct line of communication between payer and payee instead of BOLT11-style interaction, which addresses some issues such as payee anonymity. The idea is still half-baked with many details not worked out yet, but he registered it as BOLT #12.ZmnSCPxj responded to Corne's email on March 9, 2018. He suggested reusing the work being done by the Web Payments Working Group of W3C, of which Christian Decker of Blockstream is a member. Christian aims to make Bitcoin payments payable over web payment protocols that W3C group is working on. ZmnSCPxj thought that the Web Payments Working Group could provide better perspective on various other payment use cases as well as their subtleties, which can help inform Corne's considerations in his proposed BOLT12. Corne was interested in the effort too and explained the various levels of web payments incubation. Working Group is for wide deployment in browsers. Interest Group is for ideas that are aimed at standards track. Community group is aimed at new ideas and specs which can have stable references but may be more on the bleeding edge. Since he does quite a bit of work with the W3C, he volunteered to look over things as he would like to include something similar in his apps.</p>
