    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj and Andrew discuss the use of adaptor signatures as a replacement for hash challenges in a protocol involving timelock scripts. They also discuss Graftroot, a technique which allows parties to share a commit transaction. However, Andrew raises concerns about the symmetry of commitment transactions and suggests that each side will still need its own commitment transaction. ZmnSCPxj argues that symmetry in commitment transactions is not particularly space-heavy as well-behaved nodes can delete old commitments from disk and only need to store their own commitments. Finally, they both agree that the "output has different spend conditions depending on who publishes to the chain" primitive offered by Graftroot is a very interesting feature that has not received much attention until recently.</p>
