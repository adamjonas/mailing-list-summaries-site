    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Lightning Network's RFC (Request for Comments) page, Rusty Russell suggested the inclusion of a smaller return onion to fix a problem with refunds. Andy Schroder responded by questioning how this would work if the route no longer had capacity or went down by the time the payee decided to send the refund back to the payer. Additionally, the payer may not know how much refund the payee will give them and therefore might not be able to determine the best route to build an onion for. Russell acknowledged the potential issues and noted them in the brainstorming phase. He also suggested the possibility of returning a reply message on success, but acknowledged that it would only be best-effort and wouldn't appear if the system dropped to chain. The general solution requires the ability to send payments to anonymous destinations, which isn't currently available.</p>
