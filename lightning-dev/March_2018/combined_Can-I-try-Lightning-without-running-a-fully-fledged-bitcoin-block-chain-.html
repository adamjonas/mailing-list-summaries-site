        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A discussion on the Lightning mailing list brought up the possibility of using a technique from Hyperledger to prune the blockchain based on consensus. It was suggested that old chapters of the chain could be periodically archived on 150 computers across seven continents, allowing for even distribution of storage. The proposal also mentioned that pruning could be used to validate the whole chain without needing to store all of it on a laptop.ZmnSCPxj proposed creating an implementation of this idea for bitcoind and sharing it on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Segue questioned why old chapters couldn't be stored in a distributed manner, with 150 computers storing the index to reconnect with a chapter if needed. Yubin Ruan asked about trying Lightning without running a full Bitcoin block chain due to limited space on their laptop. Federico Tenga suggested pruning as an option that would still require validation of the entire chain but wouldn't need to store all of it on the disk.The proposal to archive chunks of the blockchain on 150 computers across seven continents aims to address the issue of infinite chain length and limited storage space. Storing old chapters in an evenly distributed manner while only distributing the index would allow for efficient access. Meanwhile, Yubin Ruan expressed concern about not having enough space to store the entire blockchain on their laptop. Aleksej suggested running a pruning node as an alternative. However, ZmnSCPxj replied that C-lightning does not currently work with a pruning bitcoind. The suggestion was made to peer with a neutrino-supporting bitcoin peer.In summary, there were discussions on the Lightning mailing list about the possibility of pruning the blockchain and archiving old chapters on distributed computers. There were also suggestions to try Lightning without a full Bitcoin block chain and to run a pruning node. However, compatibility issues with C-lightning were noted. Yubin Ruan expressed concern about limited storage space, and the solution of peering with a neutrino-supporting bitcoin peer was proposed.</p>
