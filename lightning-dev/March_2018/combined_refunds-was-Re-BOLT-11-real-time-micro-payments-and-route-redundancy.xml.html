        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell, a contributor to Lightning Network, has proposed a more complex scheme using round-trip payments to overcome the limitations of privacy with refund requests. However, this scheme has its own limitations as each encrypted hop contains the amount it expects to be sent. To address this issue, he suggested the inclusion of a smaller return onion to allow for proper refunds, which he added to the brainstorming section in the Lightning Network RFC. Andy Schroder raised concerns about what would happen if the route no longer had capacity or went down by the time the payee decided to send the refund back to the payer. Additionally, there is the issue of the payer not knowing how much refund the payee will give them and therefore might not be able to determine the best route to build an onion for. Russell acknowledged these potential issues and noted them in the brainstorming phase. Russell also proposed the possibility of returning a reply message on success, but acknowledged that it would only be best-effort and wouldn't appear if the system dropped to chain. The general solution requires the ability to send payments to anonymous destinations, which isn't currently available. Overall, there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure proper privacy and efficient refunds in the Lightning Network.</p>
