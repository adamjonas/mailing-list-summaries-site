    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email sent to developers, ZmnSCPxj proposed creating an implementation of an idea for bitcoind and sharing it on bitcoin-dev. The proposal was slightly off-topic but relevant to the blockchain. Segue, also in an email, questioned why old chapters of the blockchain couldn't be periodically peeled off and stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet. This would involve a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents storing the index in order to reconnect with a chapter if needed. On a separate note, Yubin Ruan asked if they could try Lightning without running a fully-fledged Bitcoin block chain as they didn't have enough space to store the whole blockchain on their laptop. Federico Tenga suggested pruning as an option, which would still require validating the whole chain but wouldn't need to store all of it on the disk.</p>
