    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is seeking information on the mechanics of Lightning fees, particularly in the case of routed payments. They provide an example of a multi-hop payment from A to D through B and C with established channels. The writer is looking for a high-level explanation of how fees are established, announced, and ultimately claimed in such a payment. They have several questions including whether A knows ahead of time the fees on B and C, how A knows the amount of fees that need to be added to the payment to cover all fees, if D is aware of the full amount including fees, and how the fees are actually claimed. The writer is hoping someone can point them in the right direction to find the answers they seek.</p>
