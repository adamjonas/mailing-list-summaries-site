        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email discusses the differences between Poon-Dryja (revocation) channels and Decker-Wattenhofer duplex micropayment channels. The maximum lockup period for funds in a channel is proportional to the number of updates the channel can have, with shorter worst-case lockup periods resulting from fewer updates before the channel can only be closed. Poon-Dryja channels have no limit on the number of updates possible and use O(1) lockup time and transactions for an n update limit. In contrast, Decker-Wattenhofer uses O(log n) lockup time and transactions for n update limits. Every payment requires two updates, one to get payer funds to an HTLC and the other to get the HTLC funds to the payee.Although Decker-Wattenhofer has the advantage of being extendable to any number of participants per channel, the construction of Poon-Dryja channels cannot be easily extended beyond two per channel. To address this limitation, Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories combine multiple two-participant Poon-Dryja channels that can have any number of updates, with the Decker-Wattenhofer part only updated if all participants agree to redistribute their funds. Rusty Russell’s “shachain” concept reduces storage for a sequence of revocation keys to just 64 bytes. The writer of the email, who is new to lightning dev, has been studying Christian Decker's work on duplex micropayment channels and wonders why the lightning spec went with the revocation key system instead of Decker's solution. The writer acknowledges that the revocation system was already in the whitepaper but finds it complex to handle and potentially requiring a third party observing service to detect cheaters. The writer expresses respect for the creators of the lightning network and believes it will become history. However, the key revocation system in Lightning Network seems to be complex to handle and requires a third party observing service to detect a cheater. Rusty also mentioned this in his article on the matter.Under Decker-Wattenhofer, a potential thief could try to reuse old invalid state, making it necessary to be online after the kickoff transaction gets confirmed to broadcast the latest commitment transaction. If offline for long, a watchtower-like service is also needed. Watchtowers under Poon-Dryja only need to store the shachain and the funding txid, while those under Decker-Wattenhofer would have to store entire relative-timelocked transactions, leaking economic information at each update. Channels drop on-chain, making economic information publicly readable.</p>
