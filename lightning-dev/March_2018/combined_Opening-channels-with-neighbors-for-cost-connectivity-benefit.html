        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The sender node in the Lightning network may not always know the direction of a channel publicly to ensure privacy. The implementation of the Barabasi-Albert model by lnd, which looks for hub nodes, has the potential to centralize the network and compromise privacy and availability. To address this issue, the concept of cyclic superhubs is being considered, which could create a grid-like network with alternate routes. However, there are challenges when it comes to shutting down or buggy nodes.To spread counterparty risk among more nodes, atomic multipath payments are necessary. This approach would help minimize transaction costs and maximize the number of nodes that can be reached. In response to Karan's query, if Bob wants to send money to Alice but doesn't have a route to her, he can connect with nodes that have a route to Alice through Charlie or Dave. This would allow Bob to reach Alice while minimizing transaction costs and increasing the number of nodes he can access through this channel. The choice of nodes to connect with would be based on transaction fees and the connectedness they bring to the originating node. This idea could benefit both Bob and the Lightning network as a whole.Overall, there is a need for a smarter way to open channels in the Lightning network that increases connectedness while saving money. Feedback on this concept is welcomed.</p>
