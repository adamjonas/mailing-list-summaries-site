        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The sender node sometimes does not have a route to the receiving node accepting lightning payments, and since opening new channels is costly, there may be a smarter way to open channels. Opening a new channel with Alice is costly for Bob if that was the only transaction he ever wanted to do with her. However, if Alice was connected to Charlie and Dave, he could instead connect with Charlie/Dave or nodes connected with them which have a route to Alice through Charlie/Dave such that it minimizes the transaction cost to reaching Alice. Essentially, sorting choice of the nodes to open a channel with by transaction fee and connectedness it brings to the origin node would benefit Bob in the long term and also maybe lightning network as a whole. The channel direction cannot be determined publicly as sharing that information would hurt privacy.</p>
