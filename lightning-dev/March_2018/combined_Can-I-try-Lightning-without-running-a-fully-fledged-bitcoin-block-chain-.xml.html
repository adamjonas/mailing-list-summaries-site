        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Yubin Ruan, a member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, expressed concern over not having enough space on their laptop to store the entire blockchain. The context did not provide any information about what specific blockchain Yubin was referring to. A suggestion was made to create an implementation of a technique used in Hyperledger to prune the blockchain, which would involve periodically archiving old chapters of the chain on a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents instead of continuing to add on to an increasingly long and infinite chain. In a discussion on the possibility of using a similar technique used in Hyperledger to prune the blockchain based on consensus, Christian pointed out that it is probably off-topic for the Lightning mailing list and suggested taking the discussion to either the bitcoin-dev or bitcoin-core-dev mailing lists. Federico Tenga suggested pruning as an option to validate the whole chain without needing to store all the blockchain on his disk. The idea of archiving chunks of blockchain on a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents has been proposed as a solution to the seemingly infinite length of the chain and the need for storing it on individual devices. Yubin Ruan had questioned whether it was possible to try Lightning without running a fully-fledged bitcoin block chain, due to limited space on their laptop. In an email sent to developers, ZmnSCPxj proposed creating an implementation of an idea for bitcoind and sharing it on bitcoin-dev. Segue questioned why old chapters of the blockchain couldn't be periodically peeled off and stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet. This would involve a minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents storing the index in order to reconnect with a chapter if needed.</p>
