    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the use of lightning routing for payments, Andy Schroder raised some questions about various aspects of the process. Corné Plooy responded to the queries and explained that TOR onion routing is not the same as Lightning onion routing, which is used for anonymous payments. Plooy also suggested that the payer or payee can decide on the amount and that the capacity of the partial onion route could be an issue. He proposed using the same "introduction point" for all routes to maintain privacy. He further stated that he might consider simplifying BOLT 12 by removing the possibility of refunds, but this would be revisited later with proper features added. Plooy also clarified the use case of the URL; it contains an optional invoice ID, and a payee can give the same URL to one or more payers for performing payments. Finally, Plooy asked for suggestions for working out the details of BOLT 12 and how to have it pulled into lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc.</p>
