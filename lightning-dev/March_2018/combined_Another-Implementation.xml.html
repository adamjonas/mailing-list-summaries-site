        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Kenichi Kurimoto and his corporate team, Nayuta Inc., are working on developing an application and architecture that combines cryptocurrency and IoT. They are currently in the development phase of implementing another Node software based on Lightning Network Specification (BOLT). The basic features of BOLT work on a small closed Testnet network with LND, c-lightning, and éclair. Instructions on how to use it on a closed network can be found on Nayuta Inc.’s Github page. However, ip address broadcast mode has not been tested yet.Once the node has a valid path to starblocks, payment for starblocks can be made. Kenichi expresses respect for the efforts of the people who made the RFC document, and Nayuta Inc. wishes to contribute further to protocol development. Rusty, who wrote to Kenichi, invites him to join their Google Hangout every two weeks to discuss the specification progress.</p>
