        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In Lightning Network, channels can be used to establish routes for routed payments, allowing a payment from A to D to be made through B and C. The fees on B and C are known ahead of time by A through the `channel_update` message in BOLT#7, which contains `fee_base_msat` and `fee_proportional_millionths`. To compute the payment that needs to reach C, the C->D fee is calculated by adding the `fee_base_msat` and (C->D `fee_proportion_millionts` * `msatoshi` / 1,000,000) to the payment value.Similarly, the payment from B to C is computed by replacing `msatoshi` with the payment that should reach C. A offers B a value higher than what it instructs B to forward to C, and the difference is the fee. A pays the entire fee since the highest value is at the source. To announce fees in the payment scenario, node gossip is used through `channel_update` messages. However, the balance of each peer on the network is not revealed as it represents the amount of money each peer owns on that channel. Real-life implementations like c-lightning get payment routes through brute-force trial-and-error, which is less desirable than getting exact channel balances at each balance update.ZmnSCPxj proposes the idea of channels having the option to publicize their balances to improve routing performance and scalability in a large network while balancing privacy with efficiency. Channels with high balance could have their fees reduced to encourage others to use them, and channels with low balance could have their fees increased. Adjusting Lightning network fees could also improve economic efficiency and impact expected channel lifetime. Nonlinear pricing combined with the AMP proposal would increase efficiency. However, no current node software implements this yet.Fee establishment, announcement, and claiming in a payment over Lightning Network are detailed in the BOLT spec. Node gossip provides information about `fee_base_msat` and `fee_proportional_millionths` for each channel in the `channel_update` message. If A has obsolete information about fees, payment routing will fail, but the channel_update will be sent as part of the error message. A computes the fees needed to cover all fees and offers B a higher value than what it instructs B to forward to C. The difference is the fee, and A pays the entire fee since the highest value is at the source.</p>
