    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Corne and ZmnSCPxj involves various aspects of the Lightning Network. They discuss the partial onion routing in comparison to TOR's introduction points, and conclude that they are almost equivalent. The issue of unknown capacity arises, which is worse than when the payer can choose a route freely. Two concepts are proposed to solve this issue: giving a batch of alternative routes or providing new alternatives interactively. They also consider using the same "introduction point" for all routes to ensure privacy. Regarding refunds, ZmnSCPxj suggests simplifying BOLT 12 by removing the possibility of refunds, which can be added later as an optional feature. In terms of URLs, they explain that a payee can request payment for a single transaction by handing over a URL that includes an invoice ID to a single payer. This provides functionality similar to BOLT 11, but with defined channels for transmitting larger invoice descriptions and for using partial onion routes. A payee can also hand over a URL without invoice ID, which can be used and reused by one or more payers. However, it is unclear how the payer derives the payment hash or whether they have to contact the payee again for a fresh payment hash.</p>
