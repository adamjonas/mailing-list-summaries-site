    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message is contemplating how to use Lightning for different types of payments and finds that it may be inconvenient for certain scenarios such as salary payments or direct pay-out of cryptocurrency bought on an exchange. To address some of these issues, the author proposes having a direct line of communication between payer and payee in place of BOLT11-style interaction and has created an idea that addresses this problem. The proposal also offers payee anonymity. Although the proposal is still a work in progress with many details not yet worked out, interested parties can read about it on GitHub where the author has registered bolt #12. The author invites feedback on the proposal.</p>
