        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Kenichi Kurimoto from Nayuta Inc. and his team are seeking to combine cryptocurrency and IoT, implementing a Node software according to the Lightning Network Specification(BOLT). The basic features of BOLT works on small closed Testnet network with LND, c-lightning, and éclair, and they have written how to use it on closed network. When this node has a valid path to starblocks, payment for starblocks can be done. They have not tested ip address broadcast mode. Kenichi Kurimoto and his team have respect for the efforts of people who made RFC document, and they would like to contribute further protocol development. Rusty Russell invited him to join their Google Hangout every two weeks to discuss specification progress.</p>
