    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kenichi Kurimoto, representing a corporate team called Nayuta Inc., has been working on developing an application and architecture that combines cryptocurrency and IoT. The team is implementing another Node software as per the Lightning Network Specification (BOLT). Although still in the development phase, the basic features of BOLT work on a small closed Testnet network with LND, c-lightning, and Ã©clair. They have written instructions on how to use it on a closed network. Once this node has a valid path to starblocks, payment for starblocks can be done. However, they have not tested ip address broadcast mode yet. Kenichi expresses his respect for the efforts of the people who made the RFC document, and they would like to contribute further to protocol development. Rusty, who wrote to Kenichi, mentions that they have seen many of his intelligent questions on the lightning-rfc GitHub and invites him to join their Google Hangout every two weeks to discuss the specification progress.</p>
