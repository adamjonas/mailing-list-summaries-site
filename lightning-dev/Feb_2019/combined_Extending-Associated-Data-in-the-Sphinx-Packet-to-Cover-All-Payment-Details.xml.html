        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The message warns of the possibility of a "replay" attack, which can occur if an adversary injects a stale packet into the network to observe its propagation. To prevent this, all implementations should keep a Sphinx reply cache of past shared secrets, and reject packets with identical shared secrets already in the cache. The sphinx packet construction allows optional plaintext data to be authenticated alongside the packet.Payments have clear expiration dates that can serve as the lifetime of a payment circuit session. However, since the CLTV isn't authenticated, it's possible to inject a new HTLC with a fresher CLTV. To address this, the associated data payload can be extended to cover the CLTV and bind the adversary to using the same CLTV details, causing the victim node to reject the HTLC since it has already expired.Further payment details, such as the HTLC amount, can also be added to make the probing vector more expensive for the adversary. This can be done by using a new packet version in the Sphinx packet and signaling it with a global feature bit. Nodes that come across this new version would then include the extra information in the AD for their MAC check.Additionally, the message suggests committing to the packet version to prevent nodes from swapping it out with another version, potentially causing another node to reject the packet. In the longer term, all payment details may end up in the Sphinx packet, with only link level details such as the HTLC ID outside in the update_add_htlc message.</p>
