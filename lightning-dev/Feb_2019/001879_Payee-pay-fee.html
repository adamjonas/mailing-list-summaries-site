    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell, a Bitcoin Lightning Network developer, has suggested the creation of new URI schemes to facilitate the payment process for recurring payments. Currently, yalls.org requires users to produce an invoice which it will then pay, but the process is manual and messy. Rusty has proposed a mechanism for such "pull an invoice" requests, which was previously suggested by Takaya Imai at the summit. The mechanism would work through a web platform where clients can send invoices or offers over HTTPS. The proposal includes the development of a new message type to route these requests through the lightning network in order to provide an automated payment mechanism. The proposal would also require a format for bolt11 offers to act as templates for the real invoice(s) to be fetched automatically.</p>
