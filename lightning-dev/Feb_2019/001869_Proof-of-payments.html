    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent exchange, it was determined that user identification across multiple payments is not a good idea. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggested that services could ask for the preimage of an invoice that has already been paid in order to prove payment for things like redownloading previously purchased documents. Jo√£o Joyce wondered if there is interest in standardizing a way for payment invoices to contain information that signals wallets to skip the payment process if they can provide a preimage for a previous payment for that particular item. Use cases could extend beyond downloads, such as paying for 30 days of a service and accessing it by scanning the LN invoice. While intermediate nodes know about the preimage, this aspect was not the focus of the discussion.</p>
