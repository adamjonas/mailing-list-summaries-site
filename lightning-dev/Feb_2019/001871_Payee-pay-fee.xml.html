    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Cezary Dziemian has asked if there are any plans to offer a payment solution where the payee pays the fee instead of the payer. He raised an issue with their exchange where users can withdraw funds using LN, but cannot withdraw everything they have if they do not know the fee in advance. The assumption is that users can withdraw up to 99.5% of their funds, but it would be better if they could withdraw everything and receive only their funds minus the fee. It is unclear whether this topic has been discussed before.</p>
