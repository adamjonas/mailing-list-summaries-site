    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Rusty, the topic of discussion is a web way for clients to send invoices or offers over HTTPS. ZmnSCPxj expresses confusion on whether this requires a new URI scheme and how it would work. Rusty suggests that offers can work over Lightning Network (LN) alone and explains the process in seven steps. However, ZmnSCPxj raises a concern about how the payee will know to give the BOLT12 offer to the payer. Rusty suggests that a node issuing a BOLT12 offer would implicitly signal its support for this feature and a node that can understand a BOLT12 offer means it supports this feature. They both agree that it may be better to use a real message format instead of a fake payment. Finally, they suggest that offers can be a new thing and need not be crammed into bolt11 in some backward compat way.</p>
