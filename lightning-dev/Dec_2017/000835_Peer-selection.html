    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>To discover nodes and see which ones are currently running on the network, there is a UI available for users. When someone wants to connect with another node, they will send channel funding messages. If someone wants to become a hub and earn routing fees, it is beneficial to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. Routing fees are based on a percentage of transactions, and the amount earned can vary between hubs. To select which hub to connect to, there is no current performance or reputation information available, but users can use their own selection criteria. Channels are initially single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channels that did not make it into version 1.0. It is suggested that if you have some onchain bitcoins to invest, it is in your best interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. This way, you could receive payments from other users and have a higher chance of being routed through.</p>
