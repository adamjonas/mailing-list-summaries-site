    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is seeking information about setting up channels so that fees can depend on the direction - a different fee for receiving and sending. The writer explains that this could help with balancing channels, which can become imbalanced if most transactions flow in one direction. In such cases, rebalancing the channels can take a long time or require closing the channels entirely. By ramping up fees on the receiving end of a channel that is getting large and lowering fees on the empty end, it may be possible to prevent imbalance. The writer also notes that there is a risk involved in lightning network channels, as they become riskier on the receive side the more the channel value deviates from the original state. Regulating imbalance with fees could reduce this risk, and it would be ideal if LN applications could do this automatically.</p>
