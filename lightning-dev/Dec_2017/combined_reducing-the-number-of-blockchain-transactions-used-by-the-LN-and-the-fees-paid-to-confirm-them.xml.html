        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the Lightning-dev mailing list, a new idea has been presented by Jim Renkel to reduce the number of blockchain transactions used by the LN and the fees paid to confirm them. He suggested an operation to deposit and withdraw funding in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, which could significantly reduce the number of blockchain transactions required. The adjustment transaction is never bigger than the closing and re-opening transactions put together and sometimes smaller. This reduction in fees is by an additive amount, and the fee rate can be reduced, reducing the fee paid by a multiplicative amount.ZmnSCPxj then mentioned the "splice in/out" protocol that will exist in BOLT 1.1. If splicing-in is involved, there is the possibility that inputs are forcibly double-spent while the splicing transaction is unconfirmed, so the channel cannot be safely used until the splicing transaction is confirmed. The asynchronous splice-in protocol involves two transactions but can use the channel as soon as splice protocol completes, whereas synchronous splice-in involves only one transaction, but the channel cannot be used until the splicing transaction is confirmed.The author, a computer networking developer new to cryptocurrency, has proposed an idea to reduce the number of blockchain transactions and fees associated with the common use case of frequent purchases from the same merchant over an extended period of time using the Lightning Network (LN). Currently, each close/re-open cycle requires two blockchain transactions, resulting in 2*n blockchain transactions required over the life of the channel.However, if the LN were enhanced with an operation to deposit and withdraw funding in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, this could be done with a single blockchain transaction that would merge the closing and re-opening transactions. The proposed adjustment transaction is sometimes smaller than the closing and re-opening transactions combined, leading to a reduction in fees paid for operating the channel. In a post to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Jim Renkel suggested an idea for reducing the number of blockchain transactions used by the Lightning Network (LN) and the fees paid to confirm them in a common use case where a customer frequently purchases from the same merchant over an extended period. Renkel suggests that if the LN were enhanced with a mechanism to deposit and withdraw funding in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, it could be done with a single blockchain transaction that is essentially the merge of the closing and re-opening blockchain transactions. This would reduce the number of blockchain transactions required by almost 50% in the limit as the number of close/re-open cycles approaches infinity. Renkel provides a detailed analysis of his proposal, including the impact on blockchain transaction fees. He invites comments from the community and offers to work with others to flesh out a detailed specification if consensus can be reached. The author welcomes comments on their proposal and offers to work with the community to flesh out a detailed specification and participate in the implementation if consensus can be reached.</p>
