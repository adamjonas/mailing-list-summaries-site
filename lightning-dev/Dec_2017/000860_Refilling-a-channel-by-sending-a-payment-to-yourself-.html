    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is new to LN and has been trying it out on testnet. They have encountered the problem of channels getting exhausted and are unsure of how to proceed without incurring high fees. The author proposes a "refill method" where they can pay themselves via a common channel in order to refill their exhausted channel with another party. By doing this, they would only have to pay the base fee once to the common channel instead of paying it multiple times for each micro-transaction. The author expects to save a couple of dollars using this method. They also ask if this is the same as using the -r tag in payment invoices and suggest adding a "refill" button in the UI.</p>
