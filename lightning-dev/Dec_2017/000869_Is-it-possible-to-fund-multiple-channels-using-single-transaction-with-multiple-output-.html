    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user on a mailing list asked if it was possible to use transaction batching to create multiple lightning channels with a single transaction and reduce transaction fees. Christian, another member of the list, responded affirmatively and explained that a single transaction can fund multiple channels since the protocol always refers to a channel by its short channel ID. However, he noted that this is currently not implemented in any wallets but shouldn't be too difficult to do so. The main challenge is coordinating the fund-channel process for all channels in parallel, so initially, it would only be used to fund channels from a single initiator.</p>
