    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, participants debated the necessity and potential drawbacks of payment limits for Bitcoin Lightning Network. While some viewed these limits as necessary to prevent centralization, others argued that they hindered important use cases, such as large payment channels and routing of LN payments. The possibility of removing the limits in the future was also raised, with some suggesting that this would encourage the growth of a mesh network. However, concerns were expressed about the risks associated with larger channel sizes and the potential for attacks. Additionally, there were concerns that businesses may not be able to operate using Lightning due to the small channel sizes and payment limits. Despite differing opinions, most agreed that more experience with the network was needed before making any final decisions.</p>
