    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email states that although they do not have a solid opinion formed yet, they understand all the points made regarding the necessity of payment limits within Lightning channels. They believe that a limit is not harmful as long as the purchasing power of Bitcoin does not decrease dramatically. The author sees this limit as being like the block size limit in that it is conservative and needs more experience to determine whether it is necessary at all. The author's main concern lies in the fact that large businesses cannot operate using Lightning due to the channel sizes and payment sizes being too small. Furthermore, the author discusses why one may not want to accept large incoming channels, stating that it may encourage people to pay them to route through one of the super nodes which are likely spies or targets of spies. Another topic discussed is the ability to split up large payments into smaller ones without incurring too much cost or trouble, but this is not possible when creating channels. The author believes that a limit encourages the growth of the network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms. Finally, the author questions the need for a payment limit if there is already a channel limit in place.</p>
