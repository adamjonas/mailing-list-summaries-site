    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the post is relatively new to Lightning Network and shared their thoughts on the channel and payment limits. They were surprised to hear that these limits may be intended to stick around long term. The channel limit, in particular, was seen as restrictive and not justified in a two-party system. The author also disagreed with the idea of keeping most funds in cold storage and believed it goes against the spirit of Bitcoin. There was also confusion regarding why a node would reject a large channel being made with it. The author agreed that current limits are fine for LN's baby steps but overly restrictive for a mature LN network. Ideally, the author wants these limits to be non-existent or configurable by nodes.</p>
