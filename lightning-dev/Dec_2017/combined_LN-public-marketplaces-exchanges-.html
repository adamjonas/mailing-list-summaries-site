        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The original message is a proposal for a Lightning Network (LN) infrastructure that enables the creation of marketplaces or exchanges, where intermediaries can offer to instantly take over payment obligations from other users in exchange for transaction fees. The idea is to enable instant payments by having middlemen help with their own funds without risking them. This would allow the establishment of many such exchanges, and users would benefit from a small income stream. Participants would not experience negative consequences if an exchange goes down. In response to the proposal, Christian Decker questioned the use-case and asked whether it was meant to facilitate multi-hop payments or short-term loans to get bills paid. He also pointed out that since all payments in LN are fully backed by Bitcoin, there is no support for short-term loans yet. The author of the original message explained that they are new to LN and suggested that an instant payment could be realized if a middleman pays out the amount to the receiver immediately and gets their money back from the original sender the normal way after waiting the usual 10+ minutes. The middlemen would announce their services at a marketplace, indicating the highest amount they are willing to overtake plus the fees they want. Bitcoin would then pick the best offer from the orderbook of the marketplace and process the transaction that way. The advantages of this scenario include having the receiver get the money instantly, any user being able to play middleman, middlemen earning from the fees, and exchanges getting established.</p>
