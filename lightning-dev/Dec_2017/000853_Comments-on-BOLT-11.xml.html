    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alex Bosworth is the owner of HTLC.me and according to a conversation between Jonathan Underwood and Rusty Russell, HTLC.me is one node that separates its balance into user accounts outside lightning. To join user data and the payment hash on their end, HTLC.me uses descriptions. The identifier is used so that when their backend checks the payment request status, the user info is readily available in their local lnd RPC response rather than having to store it in a separate database. However, the description field is only meant to be displayed to the user and not used by the recipient. Rusty urged HTLC.me to fix the violation since the description field was being used for something other than its intended purpose. Jonathan also suggested a requirement to hide text in the description under certain conditions.</p>
