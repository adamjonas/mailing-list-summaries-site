    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Andy Schroder, they discuss the capacity limit on Lightning channels. Christian explains that unlike bitcoin block size, the capacity limit is not consensus critical and can be changed at any point in time by the two endpoints of a channel. Andy suggests that a limit doesn't hurt right now but may be needed for lightning channels depending on how the network evolves. He also expresses concern that large businesses wouldn't be able to operate using lightning because of small channel sizes and payment limits. Additionally, he raises the issue of encouraging people to pay him to route through one of the super nodes. ZmnSCPxj joins the discussion, suggesting a limit at the protocol level encourages the growth of the network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms. The conversation continues with discussion about the risks of accepting large incoming channels. Overall, the email exchange provides insights into the ongoing discussion around the capacity limit on Lightning channels.</p>
