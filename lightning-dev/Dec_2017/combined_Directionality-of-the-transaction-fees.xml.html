        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent conversation on the Lightning Network mailing list, Rusty Russell and Edward discussed the possibility of setting fees for each direction of a channel. The main concern was that in some scenarios, the creator of an LN channel pays all on-chain fees, while the other side of the channel simply cashes out the balance, leaving the initiator without the channel opening fees and no receiving channel.Rusty Russell explained that the channel initiator pays all on-chain fees at the moment, which is simple but potentially gamable. However, it was confirmed that the fees can indeed be set for each direction of the channel by each node in the channel, as per the lightning-rfc. This means that regulating imbalances with fees would be best if the LN applications could do it automatically. The channel reserves ensure that each node always has some balance at stake in case an old state is broadcast. While forwarding nodes can charge appropriate fees, receiving is more costly than sending if you have more than the initial state of your channel. Channel_update messages are used to control your own fees, which follow after the initial mutual channel_announce message.It is important to note that negative fees would complicate routing in the network. Therefore, it is essential for LN applications to regulate imbalances with fees to prevent potential issues. Overall, the discussion highlighted the need for proper regulation of fees in both directions of an LN channel to ensure fair transactions for all parties involved.</p>
