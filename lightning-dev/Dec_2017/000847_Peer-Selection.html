    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is questioning the need for connecting to any node other than Blockstream if they run a high-quality node that would eliminate the need for the user to be online or monitor the blockchain. The writer believes that this is similar to using Pepsi instead of an unnamed cola. Christian Decker adds to the discussion by explaining that if a user does not announce the existence of a channel to the wider network, they can still receive incoming payments by informing the payment sender about the channel. This can be achieved by adding the 'r' parameter to the payment request. Even with just one announced channel, people might still want to route through the user by using the channel twice, which may be useful in hiding the real origin/destination of the payment or for bookkeeping purposes. The decision to announce a channel allows for bidirectional payments and prevents random people from routing through the user.</p>
