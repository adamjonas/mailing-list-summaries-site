    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network requires every node to be aware of every other node in order to choose a complete route for transactions. With the potential for 7e10 nodes in a fully connected graph, there would need to be 7e10 channels and likely even more data storage requirements. This seems unfeasible, so there needs to be a method for peers to only keep track of nearby nodes and have routing tables for more distant nodes. The use of a DHT could be an example of this type of system. However, designing a system where no intermediate node knows both sender and receiver is challenging but possible. It is unclear why this type of system is not currently being implemented.</p>
