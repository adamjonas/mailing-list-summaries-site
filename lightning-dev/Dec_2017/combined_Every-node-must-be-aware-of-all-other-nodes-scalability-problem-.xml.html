        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is facing scalability issues as every node needs to be aware of every other node in the network in order to choose a complete route for transactions. With the potential for 7e10 nodes, there would need to be 7e10 channels and an immense amount of data storage requirements. A suggested solution is to have peers only keep track of nearby nodes and have routing tables for more distant ones, using a DHT as an example. However, designing a system where no intermediate node knows both sender and receiver is challenging but possible. Christian responds by saying that more advanced path-finding algorithms are already being considered to reduce the need for complete information on each node. The routing problem is currently a luxury problem since there are many aspects to implement generally for Lightning. Rusty provided some calculations about the raw size of the data that a node has to handle for 1 million nodes, which comes to about 120 MB without updates.</p>
