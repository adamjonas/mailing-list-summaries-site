    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The individual who wrote this post is attempting to understand how to find a peer for their lightning connections. They are specifically interested in connecting with nodes that have 6 links, each having $100. The author poses several questions related to this topic, such as how to select nodes to peer with and how to convince them to do deposits. Ideally, the author would like their peers to match their $100 deposit, but they are unsure if this is feasible. Additionally, the author wants to know how to determine if someone wishes to connect with them.</p>
