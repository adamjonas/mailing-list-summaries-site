    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj proposed the creation of a "multifundchannel" command that would allow for the creation of a transaction with multiple channel outputs and negotiation with each node. However, this proposed command faces difficulties in ensuring that all target nodes are alive and deciding what to do if some target nodes are not contactable. It also requires waiting for all counterparties to complete the protocol and sign the commitment transactions before signing and broadcasting the initial opening transaction. Nevertheless, the same command could be modified in the future to utilize Decker-Burchert-Wattenhofer channel factories which are initially funded by a single party. Although this raises questions about how these factories would function, the focus should be on making the network itself first. In response to Ignatius Rivaldi's question regarding whether it is possible to use transaction batching to create multiple lightning channels with a single transaction and reduce transaction fees, Christian Decker confirmed that this is possible since the protocol always refers to a channel by its short channel ID. However, this is currently not implemented in any wallets and requires coordination of the fund-channel process for all channels in parallel, making it initially only practical for funding channels from a single initiator.</p>
