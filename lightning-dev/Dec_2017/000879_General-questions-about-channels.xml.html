    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation on Lightning-dev mailing list revolves around the limitations on payment and channel sizes in Lightning Network. While some users find them restrictive, others argue that they are necessary for security reasons and to encourage the growth of the network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms. It is suggested that splitting up large payments into smaller ones through multiple invoices might be a temporary solution until the limits are increased. However, this may not be a favorable user experience, and routing larger payments over multiple routes while using a single invoice is harder as it requires different preimages for each route. It is also debated whether keeping most funds in cold storage and only a small amount for spending in hot wallets like Lightning nodes is wise or not. While some see it as a top-down approach that goes against the spirit of Bitcoin, others believe that it encourages the growth of the network towards a mesh network. Finally, it is mentioned that nodes may reject large channel openings due to the risk of getting attacked to get to the funds.</p>
