        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network protocol is a hot topic of discussion among those who are interested in connecting to the network with $600. ZmnSCPxj provides valuable information on how to select nodes to peer with, make deposits, discover nodes, use firewall traversal mechanisms, and earn routing fees as a hub. Currently, channels are initially single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channels. To make the process easier, lnd offers an "auto-pilot" feature that helps with selecting peers, while c-lightning plans to offer a similar feature in the future. To become a hub and earn routing fees, it's beneficial to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. However, there are no UIs to discover nodes currently running on the network. Each LN program keeps track of this information in its database. Acinq.co is recommended as an explorer to connect to a couple of nodes.Nodes connect to each other through payment channels, which require committing some bitcoins. Firewall traversal mechanisms are not included, but nodes can be discovered via DNS. Routing fees are determined by each node's proportional and fixed fees and can vary depending on the node's performance. Any node can become a hub without permission or special treatment of the network. It's important to note that nodes can be behind Tor hidden services (.onion domain names), although it is unclear if there are already LN software that supports being run as a Tor hidden service yet. The author can invest some on-chain bitcoins to become a hub. In conclusion, the Lightning Network protocol offers exciting opportunities for those looking to connect to the network and potentially earn routing fees as a hub.</p>
