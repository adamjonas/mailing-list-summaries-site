        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A Lightning Network user posted on the lightning-dev mailing list about a problem he faced, wherein a channel gets exhausted and he is unable to predict the amount beforehand. He suggested a "pay yourself" technique as a way to rebalance funds, which could work without modification of the protocol. However, no node software has currently implemented this technique of transferring your own funds between your own channels. The user suggested that creating a new channel to another node and then routing a payment from the new channel to the current channel could work as an alternative solution to splice-in. Although splice-in is still strictly more efficient, it requires new specs and new node software that is capable of coordinating with your own. The user suggests that doing a one-time refill of a channel could save on fees while giving users UI options like a "refill" button near a channel name.</p>
