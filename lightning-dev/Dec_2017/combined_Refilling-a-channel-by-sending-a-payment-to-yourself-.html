        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network payment protocol currently lacks a technique for transferring funds between channels, which is necessary for rebalancing purposes. However, there is a workaround known as the "pay yourself" technique that can serve as an alternative solution. This involves creating a new channel to another node and routing a payment from the new channel to the current channel. While this method is not as efficient as a direct transfer, it can still be effective with the right specifications and node software.In the original message, the author expressed their difficulties with exhausted channels while experimenting with the Lightning Network on testnet. They are uncertain about how to proceed without incurring high fees. To address this issue, the author proposes a "refill method" where they can pay themselves via a common channel to replenish their exhausted channel with another party. By doing so, they would only need to pay the base fee once to the common channel instead of paying it multiple times for each micro-transaction. This approach has the potential to save a couple of dollars in fees.The author also raises a question regarding the similarity between this refill method and using the -r tag in payment invoices. They suggest the addition of a "refill" button in the user interface (UI) near the channel name to simplify the process. Such a feature would enhance the usability of the Lightning Network and provide users with a convenient way to refill their channels without excessive fees.</p>
