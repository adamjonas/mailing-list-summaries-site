        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchange is about the potential use-case of Lightning Network (LN) for creating a marketplace where users can offer to take over payment obligations of someone else for a little income from transaction fees. The idea is that an intermediary would be available in the "orderbook" of the exchange that is willing to instantly overtake the payer's obligation, and if yes then this transaction would be dealt by LN. This would help users generate income streams without risking their funds. However, Christian, who responds to the email, is unsure about the use-case being referred to. He asks whether it is supposed to be a short-term loan to get a bill paid or supposed to facilitate multi-hop payments. In the former case, there is no support for it yet, since all of the payments in LN are always fully backed by Bitcoin. In the latter case, he doesn't see how that differs from the multi-hop payments already made in LN. ZmnSCPxj suggests the original sender could run an LN node themselves and make future payments for low fees without having to make a new onchain transaction each time. He also questions the benefit of using a middleman service given this option. Overall, the email exchange discusses the potential for creating a marketplace using LN where intermediaries can generate income streams by taking over payment obligations. However, there is some ambiguity around the specific use-case being referred to, and further clarification is needed to determine whether this is a viable idea. The proposed idea involves a middleman paying out the amount to the receiver immediately and getting their money back from the original sender the normal way, which takes at least 10 minutes for confirmation. Each transaction would then be processed by Bitcoin, picking the best offer from the order book of the marketplace and swapping the receiver with the middleman. The advantages of this system include the receiver getting the money instantly, anyone being able to play middleman, middlemen earning from the fees, exchanges being established, and more. However, it is unclear if this scenario can be set up using LN. The conversation ends with the suggestion that the idea of a marketplace for middlemen may not be feasible or beneficial in the current state of LN technology.</p>
