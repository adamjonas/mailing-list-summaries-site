        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs raised two unrelated questions. The first question was regarding whether c-lightning will support Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments. In response to this question, Darosior mentioned that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. The keysend functionality is implemented in the noise plugin and can be pulled out since it is trivial to implement. It was also noted that Sphinx-send is a misnomer, and keysend is the proper name to use.The second question raised by Pavol was about whether it is possible for a lightning node to send a push notification when it receives or routes a payment and whether this notification is cryptographically signed. In response to this question, Johan informed that lnd is getting an API in the next release (v0.10) which allows subscribing to HTLC events. The notification won't be signed but the stream uses TLS. However, he mentioned that signing can easily be added using the `signmessage` API. Johan also provided links to the relevant PR and documentation for further reference.In another Lightning-dev thread, Pavol Rusnak asked two unrelated questions. Firstly, he asked if c-lightning is going to support Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments. In response to this question, Darosior mentioned that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. The keysend functionality is implemented in the noise plugin and can be pulled out since it is trivial to implement. It was also noted that Sphinx-send is a misnomer, and keysend is the proper name to use.Secondly, Pavol asked whether a lightning node like lnd or c-lightning can send a push notification (e.g., to a webhook) when it receives or routes a payment, and if this notification is cryptographically signed with the node's private key. In response to this question, Darosior stated that c-lightning sends notifications for typical events such as "I received an HTLC!" and that a plugin can be developed to register to these lightningd notifications and send encrypted push notifications. The documentation link for this feature was provided in the response.In summary, Pavol Rusnak from SatoshiLabs asked two unrelated questions related to the lightning network. The first question was about the support for Sphinx or other forms of spontaneous payments in c-lightning, to which it was mentioned that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. The second question was regarding the ability of lightning nodes like lnd or c-lightning to send push notifications when receiving or routing payments, and whether these notifications are cryptographically signed with the node's private key. It was explained that c-lightning sends notifications for specific events and that a plugin can be developed to handle these notifications and send encrypted push notifications. Documentation links were provided for further information.</p>
