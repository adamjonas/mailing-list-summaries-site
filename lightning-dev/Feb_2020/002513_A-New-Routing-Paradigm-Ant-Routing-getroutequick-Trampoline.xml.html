    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ant Routing is a distributed pathfinding algorithm that relies on nodes emitting "pheromones" to be broadcasted over the entire network. Every node that wants to act as a forwarding node keeps a mapping from a non-self node ID to a distance counter. The pheromone consists of Node ID, reference to a channel, a proof, and a distance counter. When a node receives a pheromone from a peer with which it has a channel, it checks if the node already exists in its mapping. Combining Ant Routing and `getroutequick` algorithm can significantly reduce the resources proportional to the total number of payments globally. The `getroutequick` algorithm uses pre-cached data generated by performing Dijkstra on the entire routemap, recording the distance from our own node at each mapped node. However, there are only two failures, and they are not encrypted.Trampoline routing is a proposed solution to improve the privacy of the Lightning Network and reduce the number of channels that have to be published off-chain. This method involves adding onion routing above individual channel hops, moving the onion packet from the hop level to the trampoline node level. Nodes and channels publicly show that particular outputs on the blockchain layer are actually funding transaction outputs that back channels.Payer allocation is used to find nodes in a mapping of nodes to distance counters, with two other nodes being found that are nearer to it than the payee node, which has distance counters lower than the distance to the actual payee, so that they will be in "the same" direction or area as the final destination. Periodic updates for refreshing the network's sense of what their distance is to each node on the network are already allowed by the current gossip protocol.However, censorship attacks are trivial using this paradigm, just lying about your distance to the node you want to censor and saying you know them, then holding on to the HTLC that should go to them.</p>
