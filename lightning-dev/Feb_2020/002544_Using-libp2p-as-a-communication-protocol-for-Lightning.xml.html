    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer of the email is questioning why there is fragmentation between different projects that have similarities in networking and encoding standards. They suggest using existing open source technologies and standards such as libp2p for communication and multiformats for addresses, hashes, and encodings. The writer believes that building and evolving common toolkits and standards for decentralized systems like libp2p, multiformats, and IPLD could be useful for the whole community. It is suggested that implementing simple connection logic into a lighting implementation makes it easier to test and avoid security vulnerabilities. While people want to move fast, coordination and consensus are needed to build these kinds of specs. The Lightning community may consider using projects like libp2p and multiformats or may have decided not to use them for some reason. Links to libp2p, multiformats, and IPLD are provided.</p>
