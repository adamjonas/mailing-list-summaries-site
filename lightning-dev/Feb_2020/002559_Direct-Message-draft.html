    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Rusty and ZmnSCPxj discusses the idea of creating a circular path for communication using onion routing. The lack of "reply" function eliminates all storage requirements for intermediaries. However, it is not currently possible to fit the reply onion inside the existing onion, but they could use the same construction as in trampoline. A failure would be silent without the ability to send messages in the reverse direction. Requests that change the world must be idempotent. ZmnSCPxj suggests using this for "offers" which cause an invoice request, followed by an invoice reply. This will probably be reused once for the payment itself. Apparently, nobody replied to the HTLC spam-limit proposal tied with the circular path. ZmnSCPxj is unable to come up with an upfront scheme which doesn't leak information badly. They discuss the possibility of using Chaumian tokens and waxwing showed a PoDLE-based Chaumian token protocol which seems to be something they can use as a way to issue tokens. It requires getting the reciprocal of a scalar, an operation which is not exposed in secp256k1.h for some reason. Finally, they discuss whether requiring all Lightning nodes to have a Tor .onion address and just doing direct messaging over Tor would be better.</p>
