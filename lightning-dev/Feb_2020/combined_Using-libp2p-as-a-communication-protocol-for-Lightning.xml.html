        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email writer has raised concerns about the fragmentation between different projects that share similar networking and encoding standards. They have suggested using existing open source technologies such as libp2p for communication and multiformats for addresses, hashes, and encodings. The writer believes that building and evolving common toolkits and standards for decentralized systems like libp2p, multiformats, and IPLD could be useful for the whole community.It is suggested that implementing simple connection logic into a lighting implementation makes it easier to test and avoid security vulnerabilities. While people want to move fast, coordination and consensus are needed to build these kinds of specs. The Lightning community may consider using projects like libp2p and multiformats or may have decided not to use them for some reason.The writer has provided links to libp2p, multiformats, and IPLD for reference. By utilizing these open source technologies and standards, the community can build a more cohesive and secure decentralized system. However, coordination and consensus are necessary for successful implementation.</p>
