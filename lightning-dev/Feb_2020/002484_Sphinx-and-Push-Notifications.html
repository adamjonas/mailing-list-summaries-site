    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev thread, Pavol Rusnak asked two unrelated questions. Firstly, he asked if c-lightning is going to support Sphinx or other form of spontaneous payments. In response to this question, Darosior mentioned that cdecker is working on integrating keysend to his noise plugin. Secondly, Pavol asked whether a lightning node like lnd or c-lightning can send a push notification (e.g., to a webhook) when it receives or routes a payment, and if this notification is cryptographically signed with the node's private key. In response to this question, Darosior stated that c-lightning sends notifications for typical events such as "I received an HTLC!" and that a plugin can be developed to register to these lightningd notifications and send encrypted push notifs. The documentation link for this is provided in the response.</p>
