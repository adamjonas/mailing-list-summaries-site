    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) implementation is being discussed in an email between Gleb and Ariard. The LN relies on the capability to confirm on-chain commitment transactions unilaterally, but the current fee rates for related transactions may not be reliable. Dynamic fee-bumping could solve this issue but may also open up new attack vectors. A massive channel closing could be provoked by feeding an invalid block to light clients. Additionally, malicious attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the LN protocol could lead to mutual channel closures. To counter these attacks, it is suggested that LN light clients disable HTLC routing and avoid aggressive fee-bumping. An empirical study and simulation of fee spikes is recommended to understand the mechanics of these attacks and countermeasures. As LN becomes more important in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it is important to acknowledge mining-related incentives and risks influencing protocol development.</p>
