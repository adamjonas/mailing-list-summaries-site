    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the idea of making all dust transactions invalid by some nodes was suggested. The proposal was met with concerns over potential worst-case behavior and the risk it posed to Bitcoin as a network-facing application. A compromise was suggested to keep them in secondary storage for full nodes and a separate Merkle Tree for bridge servers. This would enhance performance for bridge servers while also reducing the risk of DoS attacks on full nodes. Dust sweep transactions containing many inputs could be fetched with only one disk visit or from a smaller subset of the UTXO set. It was emphasized that worst-case scenarios, where all transactions in a block are dust sweeps, should be considered when evaluating proposals. Sweeping dust would reduce the amount of dust remaining in the UTXO set, which would disincentivize users from creating more.</p>
