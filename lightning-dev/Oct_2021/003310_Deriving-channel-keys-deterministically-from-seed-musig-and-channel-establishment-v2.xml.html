    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, SomberNight discussed a difficulty encountered while implementing anchor output support in Electrum. Specifically, the remote-force-close case where the to_remote output is no longer a simple p2wpkh presents a challenge for restoring from seed words. Previously, Electrum set option_static_remotekey to required and restricted lightning usage to wallets that derive p2wpkh addresses, meaning if a user were to restore from seed words and their channel counterparty force closed their channel, the to_remote output of the broadcast commitment tx would directly pay to the user's wallet. With the introduction of anchors, however, the to_remote output is now a p2wsh that involves a CSV, and we cannot easily make this script correspond to a wallet address, resulting in lost funds when restoring from seed.To solve this problem, SomberNight proposed an approach to derive channel keys deterministically that allows certain forms of recovery from just a seed, which works today. However, this approach will no longer work with MuSig key aggregation in the future. An idea for a proposal is given how the channel-open flow (e.g. as part of channel v2) could be changed to make a similar approach work independent of key aggregation. SomberNight explored various solutions to the problem, including deriving a static key to be used as payment_basepoint, reused between all channels, or deriving a new bip32 chain/sequence of pubkeys used as payment_basepoint for channels, and watching these p2wsh scripts with a gap limit. However, both options have significant drawbacks related to privacy and usability. Instead, it seems desirable to extract some entropy from the blockchain and use that as a nonce to be combined with a static private secret derived from the seed.One solution exploits the fact that the funding output uses a 2of2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG script composed of the funding pubkeys of each party. The funding pubkey itself can be used as a nonce, and it can be recovered from the witness of the commitment tx. The privkey for payment_basepoint can then be derived as e.g. hash(bip32_derive(seed, HARDCODED_PATH) + funding_pubkey). This approach has been used by Eclair for some time. Electrum is likely to use this solution at least for the payment_basepoint as part of adapting to anchors.However, note that the idea (3) relies on recovering the funding_pubkey from the witness of the spending transaction, which will break in the future if the funding script is changed to e.g. a p2tr that uses musig. Therefore, all the approach needs is some blockchain-visible nonce that is already known at the time we need to construct the open_channel message, so long as the funding output uses a 2of2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG. In conclusion, SomberNight raised the question of whether such a change - or something similar - might be useful, and if so, whether it could/should be incorporated into the current channel establishment v2 proposal. If there is agreement that this would be useful, a spec change would be most useful before changing the 2of2 multisig script.</p>
