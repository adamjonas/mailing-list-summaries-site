        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network Github organization has recently undergone a major restructuring to separate the protocol specification from its implementation. This move has created a new Github organization called "lightning" and added major implementation maintainers as admins. The old lightning-rfc repository has been renamed to "bolts," while a new blips repository has been created to continue with the PR that was originally started in the lightning-rfc repository.One of the reasons behind this restructuring is that having the source code for one implementation of the Lightning Network protocol hosted with the white paper and specs can lead to misunderstandings. Laolu Osuntokun, one of the creators of lnd, has suggested that the Lightning Network specification (the BOLTs) could be moved to an independent repository owned by the community. Osuntokun currently owns the github.com/lightning domain name and has offered to donate it to the community or create a new organization like "lightning-specs" to host the specification and other community-backed/owned projects.Moving the source code of lnd from its current location at <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/</a> to another repository has also been proposed. While there are concerns about broken links if the repository is moved, it is believed that the Github "move repository" feature makes all old links auto-redirects. The goal of restructuring the Lightning Network Github organization is to formalize the set of stakeholders and the general process related to the evolution of the Lightning network protocol. An official logo/avatar for the organization is also being considered.The proposal to remove lnd's source code from the lightningnetwork Github organization and move it to lightninglabs or create a new org like "lightning-specs" owned by the community has been accepted.</p>
