        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A report has been released revealing specification-level vulnerabilities affecting lightning implementations, including c-lightning, lnd, Eclair, and LDK. These vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited in a range of attacks, from fee blackmailing to stealing counterparty channel balances. The vulnerabilities are due to the fact that the current BOLT specification only requires a dust limit on Alice's commitment to be under her channel reserve, allowing her to inflate the dust limit until reaching the implementation-defined max value and causing substantial losses to Bob's funds.The lack of check on a counterparty's dust limit was highlighted in May 2020, which was later leveraged to successfully burn the majority of a targeted node balance in fees during a test conducted in February 2021 against LND software. Following this, the maintainers of CL/LND/Eclair/LDK were notified, and mitigations began to be developed on the LDK-side. In July 2021, discussions arose around exploiting the trimmed-to-dust mechanism at `update_fee` reception. Mitigations were developed and released on the LDK-side during August 2021, with vulnerabilities disclosed to other Lightning projects such as Muun wallet and Electrum. Despite highlighting the lack of well-defined communication processes across Lightning teams, developers from three different implementations actively participated in diagnosing vulnerabilities and developing mitigations for long-standing specification issues affecting the whole Lightning ecosystem. A timeline of events is provided, including the opening of a BOLT PR #894 covering the lack of verification of counterparty per-HTLC `dust_limit_satoshis`, the development of mitigations in LDK, and the submission of BOLT PR #919 covering remaining vulnerabilities.Antoine Riard's recent comments about the reliance on the dust limit as a security measure for Bitcoin transactions highlight the importance of ensuring that transactions are secure and not relying on flawed assumptions. The conversation also touches upon the adoption of policies that could restrict transaction relays, making the network unusable. The dust limit cannot be relied on for security, and an increasing number of funds are secured by assumptions around mempool behavior. This trend is expected to increase with the growth of Lightning Network and other L2 solutions.Various solutions have been proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities, such as rejecting an estimated large dust limit at channel opening and defining a new configurable limit for maximum dust HTLC exposure. While some propose to dry-up policy rules in consensus like the dust limit, others are skeptical as policies can always be set higher than any consensus rule. The economic compatibility of policies should be considered, and economically rational node operators should follow them.In conclusion, the ongoing development of mitigations for vulnerabilities in the Lightning Network emphasizes the need for constant vigilance and updates to ensure the network remains secure and reliable. It is crucial to address these specification-level vulnerabilities to prevent potential attacks that could jeopardize the safety of funds. Developers from various implementations have actively participated in diagnosing and developing mitigations for these vulnerabilities. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure the security and reliability of the Lightning Network.</p>
