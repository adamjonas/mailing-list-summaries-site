        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is actively discussing ways to improve payment security while maintaining non-custodial payments. One suggestion was to have a huge CLTV on that hop, giving the sender a longer time to go online and clear the HTLC before it times out. Another proposal suggested using two hashes instead of one for every HTLC, even in current "online RPi user pays online RPi user" scenarios. This would use the `payment_secret` for the preimage of the second hash, providing similar protection to what `payment_secret` provides.However, adapting every node in the path to handle this might be cumbersome, so another suggestion was to use PTLCs instead. Payment settlement period is a crucial aspect, and there is a risk of losing channels if not done properly. To prevent collusion between the sender and lnurl endpoint from stealing funds, ZmnSCPxj suggested using PTLCs or two hashes in HTLCs. Matt Corallo agreed that both approaches could enhance security, but using PTLCs might be a better option because every hop along the path would need to be adapted to handle two hashes. Rusty Russell proposed a generic authorization mechanism with a fallback node that lets users choose their trust model, which Matt agreed was a good solution. The Lightning Network community is working towards improving payment security.In addition, the email thread revealed the challenges of using bolt12, where pre-printing amountless invoices is not possible, and each invoice must contain an amount. Matt and Rusty suggested a generic authorization mechanism with a fallback node to address this issue, which allows for users to choose their trust model and avoids polling by providing an onion message notification service.To accept lightning payments on mobile devices without requiring users to keep their lightning app open and in the foreground at all times, a new model was proposed. In this model, the sender sends an HTLC with a long CLTV timeout to their own LSP with instructions to forward it when they receive an onion message containing nonce B. The Tipper then sends an onion message to the recipient's LSP with the reply path to send nonce B to the Tipper's LSP when the Recipient comes online. This solution does not encumber funds for any extended period of time except for the original sender who wants to send the funds off elsewhere anyway. However, finding a better solution remains a challenge.</p>
