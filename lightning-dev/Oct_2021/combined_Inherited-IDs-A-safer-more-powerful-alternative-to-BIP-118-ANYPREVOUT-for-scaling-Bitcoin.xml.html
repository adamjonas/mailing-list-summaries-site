        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, John P. Newell responds to Anthony Towns' misunderstandings about inherited IDs (IIDs). Newell explains that despite the use of an operator in the "timeout trees", "update-forest" and "challenge-and-response" factory protocols, the operator is not a trusted party and cannot take funds or prevent others from obtaining the funds that are due to them. He also argues that IIDs cannot be simulated with anyprevout and provides an example of how IIDs can provide a trust-free means for Alice to transfer funds to Bob without putting F2 and S on-chain. Newell believes that IIDs provide functionality that anyprevout does not provide, allowing for a single on-chain transaction to transfer ownership of thousands or millions of channels in a trust-free manner. He hopes that clearing up these misunderstandings will pique Towns' interest in reading about the "timeout trees", "update-forest" and "challenge-and-response" protocols in more detail.ZmnSCPxj raised concerns over the requirement of an on-chain transaction to update the set of channels created by a factory. He argued that this defeats the purpose of having a factory in the first place, which is to allow for changes in the set of channels without requiring an on-chain transaction. To address this concern, participants can create an alternate transaction and sign it but do not broadcast it. Then they sign the alternate transaction and broadcast it, which updates the set of channels with an on-chain transaction. This approach works without changes to Bitcoin and even without Taproot, although the witness size becomes large for large N without Taproot. In essence, this approach is a "no updates" factory that cuts through its closing transaction with the opening of a new factory.Newell's remaining comments are minor and include points on the worst-case delay for eltoo-2party vs. 2Stage, the advantage of 2Stage's elimination of watchtowers, and a correction regarding the new address type for floating transactions mentioned in the paper. The paper shows that IIDs can be used to eliminate watchtowers for one or both parties in a two-party channel (2Stage), create factories that allow very large numbers of new users to obtain bitcoin in a watchtower-free and trust-free manner (timeout trees), support trust-free factories with unbounded numbers of parties (and channels) that allow the channels to be bought and sold by anyone, including parties not originally in the factory, with a single on-chain transaction, and achieve these results while using a more constrained, and thus safer, change to Bitcoin than the support for floating transactions.</p>
