    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion was held on Github regarding moving a repository and the potential issues with broken links. Bryan Bishop suggested that broken links could be solved by including a soft note in a README somewhere. However, there were concerns that this may not be enough and that old links would need to be auto-redirected. The possibility of setting up a vote was also mentioned. Matt added that he believes the Github "move repository" feature already includes auto-redirects for old links, but noted that this information is a few years old and may no longer be accurate.</p>
