    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Fabrice Drouin proposed removing the source code for LND from the lightningnetwork GitHub organization. He argued that having both the implementation and specification of the protocol in the same location had created confusion between the open-source protocol and Lightning Labs, one of the companies implementing it. This was highlighted by a recent report from Arcane Research, which mistakenly referred to LND as the "reference" client for the Lightning Network. Although Laolu Osuntokun clarified that LND has never referred to itself as such, he agreed that separating the spec and implementation would be beneficial.Osuntokun suggested moving the spec to an independent repository owned by the community or creating a new organization like "lightning-specs." He offered to donate the domain name "github.com/lightning," and said that creating a new organization would be a good opportunity to formalize the set of stakeholders and the general process related to the evolution of the Lightning protocol. The proposal sparked discussion, with some expressing concern about fragmentation and others agreeing that separation would be useful. No final decision has been made yet.</p>
