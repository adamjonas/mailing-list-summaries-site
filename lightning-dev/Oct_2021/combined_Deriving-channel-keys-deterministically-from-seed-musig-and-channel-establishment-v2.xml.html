        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The article discusses the challenges of implementing anchor output support in Electrum and the difficulty of restoring from seed words when the to_remote output is no longer a simple p2wpkh. The article proposes three solutions to the problem, including deriving a static key to be used as payment_basepoint, deriving a new bip32 chain/sequence of pubkeys used as payment_basepoint for channels, and extracting some entropy from the blockchain to use as a nonce to be combined with a static private secret derived from the seed. The article also explores using the funding pubkey itself as a nonce, which can be recovered from the witness of the commitment tx. The article concludes by proposing whether such a change or something similar might be useful, and if so, whether it could/should be incorporated into the current channel establishment v2 proposal.In further conversations between ZmnSCPxj and SomberNight, they discuss the privacy implications of reusing a static key as payment_basepoint for all channels and suggest tweaking the static_payment_basepoint_key using hash(seed | counterparty_node_id) for each channel. However, this requires a counter to avoid reuse between multiple channels with the same counterparty, which may be problematic as users need to open new channels after restoring from seed. An OP_RETURN containing the encrypted counterparty node id is also mentioned as an optional solution, but it is not ideal. Additionally, changing the actual commitment scheme to use MuSig1/MuSig2/MuSig-DN is a lower priority than deploying PTLCs since PTLCs can be used perfectly fine with the current commitment scheme.</p>
