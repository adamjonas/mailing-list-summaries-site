    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Recently, a commit was made to change pings from including random data to including state data. This change includes the most recent bitcoin block header. The author of the commit questioned if there were any risks associated with continuously broadcasting the most recent state to the network and whether there were any counterparty risks involved. In particular, they wondered if block header update delays could be used to de-anonymize/identify/locate nodes using update times/uncle blocks/fingerprinting attacks. Additionally, they considered if any counterparty risks exist from an attacker node pretending to be on the same block as an out-of-date node. The author requested more information about the security story surrounding this update if it has been discussed in detail.
