    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network community is discussing the use of htlc-less probes, which would eliminate the need for upfront payments when attempting to route a payment through multiple channels. Some nodes may choose to include their actual channel balances in a probe failed message. The advantages of this approach include improving user experience by reducing the load on nodes and eliminating locked up liquidity. Additionally, it opens up the possibility of charging for failed payments to address channel jamming. ZmnSCPxj proposed the idea and is being asked to draft a PR outlining the necessary new messages. Incentives for nodes to lie about their channel capacity are also being discussed, but it is noted that any potential gain from such behavior is likely outweighed by the risk of reputational damage.</p>
