    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Olaoluwa Osuntokun, one of the developers of Lightning Network Daemon (LND), has responded to a suggestion that LND's source code be removed from the lightningnetwork GitHub repository. He noted that LND was never referred to as the "reference" implementation, and that some other implementations had adopted that title before but have since changed their language. While Osuntokun agreed that it might make sense for LND's source code to be moved to a separate repository, he also suggested that the Lightning specification be moved to an independent repository owned by the community. This would allow for better organization and formalization of the stakeholders involved in the evolution of the Lightning protocol. Osuntokun also clarified that Lightning Labs had purposefully created a new GitHub organization to keep LND distinct from any future commercial products/services. The company has architected all paid products to be built on top of LND, rather than within it. Osuntokun offered to donate his existing lightning GitHub repo to the community or suggested creating a new organization called "lightning-specs" to house the Lightning specification and other community-backed/owned projects. In response, developer Matt Corallo expressed a rough agreement with the proposal to separate the Lightning specification from the LND source code. He did not have a strong opinion on where things should end up, but he was willing to help set it up.</p>
