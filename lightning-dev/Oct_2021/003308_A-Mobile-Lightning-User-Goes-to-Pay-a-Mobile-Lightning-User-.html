    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the problem of coordinating lightning payments between mobile users. Invoices provide a solution by requiring recipients to provide live-ish data to the sender, but users still want to use lightning for tips or accept payment on their phones without keeping them unlocked with the lightning app open on the foreground 24/7. Existing solutions like using custodial products, Blockstream Greenlight, keysend/AMP, and lnurl have drawbacks and do not solve the problem entirely. The email proposes a straw-man solution that involves using lnurl and PTLCs to prevent collusion between the sender and the lnurl endpoint. The proposed solution does not rely on any parties who can run away with the funds and does not require the sender to deanonymize themselves to the recipient. Thanks are given to various people for their feedback and proposals.</p>
