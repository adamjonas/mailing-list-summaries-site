    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named 'sickpig' emailed Rusty Russell on June 23, 2015 to ask if they were already on a new list. Rusty confirmed that the user was one of the early subscribers and welcomed them. However, Rusty noted that there were only 15 subscribers at the time, so he planned to wait before starting any real discussions. Rusty also mentioned that he will be discussing with CJP (author of Amiko pay) about an open question in the future.</p>
