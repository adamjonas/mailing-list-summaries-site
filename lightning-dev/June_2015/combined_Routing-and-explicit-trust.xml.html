        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The paper being discussed raises questions about the terms "channel counterparty" and "clearinghouse", highlighting the risks associated with these parties and the trustless nature of routing through them. The process of opening a channel requires trusting the counterparty up to a certain amount, which can result in capped risk if they disappear. However, the existing banking system allows for minimizing counterparty risk by shifting unwanted exposures, but systematic risk can still propagate in unexpected ways. Benjamin had queries regarding the terms, which Rusty explained in his blog series. He also explained how users could find and select intermediaries, although it remained an open question. Rusty expressed his desire to start a conversation with CJP (author of Amiko pay) about an open question related to the lightning-dev list hosted by linuxfoundation.org.In an email exchange on June 23, 2015, Rusty Russell informed 'sickpig' that they were already subscribed to the new list and welcomed them as one of the early subscribers. However, due to the low number of subscribers at the time, he planned to wait before starting any real discussions. Rusty confirmed that he would be discussing an open question with CJP in the future.</p>
