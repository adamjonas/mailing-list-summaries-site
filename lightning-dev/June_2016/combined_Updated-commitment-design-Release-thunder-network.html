        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mats Jerratsch has proposed a solution to the problem of high refund times and low revocation times in transacting with Bitcoin called 'dual-tx'. This approach is backward compatible, but it is not possible to relay optimized dual-tx payments over hops that don't support it. Dual-tx approach makes it possible to set revocation delay and payment timeouts to completely separate values.However, there are two downsides to this approach: clearing a payment on blockchain is more expensive because fees for redeeming the payment are higher, and updating the commitment transaction becomes problematic when channels have lots of uncleared payments for a long time. High revocation timeout is not suitable for 24/7 nodes but rather to ease problems for end-users when adopting to this new way of transacting.The proposed solution uses SegWit, where each payment and refund will not directly pay to their respective owner but to an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction. For redeeming a payment, one has to use R to broadcast Redeem-TX, and for broadcasting Refund-TX, one has to wait the agreed refund time. Clearing a payment on the blockchain becomes more expensive, but it is a minor issue since most channels will not get settled on the blockchain.Updating the commitment transaction requires producing and sending a new signature for each currently included payment, which might be problematic for channels with lots of uncleared payments for a long time.
