    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Peter Todd and CJP, CJP shares information regarding the work being done by Jonas Schnelli for Bitcoin on P at P layer encryption. Schnelli is using a subset of the encryption scheme OpenSSH uses, which allows him to benefit from all the review that has been done for OpenSSH. Using this encryption scheme, one can benefit from both the review that has been done for OpenSSH as well as the review from the Bitcoin Core team. While this draft predates that work, Rusty hopes that they can make them closer as their needs are slightly different. There's no "unencrypted" comms they need to bootstrap, and they want peer authentication always.</p>
