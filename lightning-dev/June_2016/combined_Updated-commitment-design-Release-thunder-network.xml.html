        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mats Jerratsch, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed a solution to address the coupling problem between revocation delay and payment timeouts using SegWit. This involves using an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction for each payment and refund to secure funds and set separate values for revocation delay and payment timeouts. However, there are trade-offs such as higher costs for clearing payments on the blockchain and producing new signatures for each included payment when updating commitment transactions.The proposed solution can be downloaded from Github, and further information is available at <a href="https://blockchain.com/thunder">https://blockchain.com/thunder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork">https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork</a>. The discussion focuses on the backward compatibility of the dual-tx approach in relaying payments with old setups and the complexity of using block counts versus times for tight timings. It can also be challenging to transact sub-dust amounts using this approach, as the cost of claiming low-value payments can exceed their value significantly.Overall, the dual-tx approach offers a clean solution to high refund times and low revocation times, but comes with some drawbacks. Nonetheless, it is backward compatible, meaning it is possible to use the old schema for low-amount payments or when relaying payments with old setups. Rusty congratulated Mats on the proposal and suggested that it deserves its own mail.</p>
