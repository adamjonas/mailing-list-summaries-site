        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developer has proposed the dual-tx approach to tackle the coupling problem between revocation delay and payment timeouts. This approach involves payments and refunds going to an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction instead of directly to their respective owners. To redeem a payment, one must also broadcast Redeem-TX, and for Refund-TX, one must wait for the agreed refund time. This approach allows separate values for revocation delay and payment timeouts, and it is backward compatible. However, clearing a payment on the blockchain is more expensive with this method, and updating the commitment transaction requires producing and sending a new signature for each included payment.Mats Jerratsch has also proposed a similar solution that involves each payment and refund paying to an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction using SegWit. This makes it possible to set revocation delay and payment timeouts separately. The proposed solution can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork/releases">https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork/releases</a>. However, clearing a payment on the blockchain is more expensive with this method, and updating the commitment transaction requires producing and sending a new signature for each included payment.Nodes need to publish their HTLC time subtraction even though the revocation value is a private arrangement. The prototype started using times everywhere but switched to blocks later due to complexity. Block counts are what active nodes care about, particularly for tight timings. Nonetheless, transacting sub-dust amounts can get significantly harder with this approach, as for a 1 satoshi payment, one would often pay more than 500 satoshis for claiming it on-chain.Rusty congratulated Mats on his proposed solution and suggested that it deserves a mail of its own.
