        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>David Coen has submitted a pull request for a new bLIP (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal) called LNURL-withdrawPOS. The proposal aims to establish an open and common standard for the receiving part of the flow in merchant Point of Sale (POS) systems with NFC sensors. LNURL-withdraw is not a new sub-protocol, but rather a bech32-encoded HTTPS query string or sub-protocol of LNURL that allows users to receive funds via the Lightning Network without creating an invoice manually.To receive funds using LNURL-withdraw, users can either scan a QR code or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet. This triggers a query to a server, which returns a JSON with information such as the maximum amount the user can receive and the minimum amount they can request.David Coen has created a schematic for a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS devices equipped with NFC sensors. This flow serves as a reference for open-source implementations of POS devices that can read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC, aiming to improve the user experience for Lightning payments powered by the LNURL protocol.There are already solutions that use this common flow or plan to implement it. To drive the adoption of this open standard, David has been in contact with representatives from various implementations, including Danny Scott from Coincorner, Danny Brewster from Fast Bitcoins, and Kamil Brejcha from Dexfin Exchange. These representatives are invited to signal their support for this flow by adding themselves to the table available on GitHub and supporting the bLIP.Before adding an implementation to the list, it must meet certain criteria. It should be open source, fully interoperable, and comply with the LNURL-withdraw specifications (LUD03). David Coen is open to discussing this further through calls and has provided a link to his calendar for scheduling meetings.Some reference implementations that have already adopted this common flow include BTCpay's LNURL NFC Support plugin by Andrew Camilleri, Coincorner's checkout system, IBEX Mercado's Point of Sale, and Fast Bitcoins's Point of Sale.To schedule a call with David Coen, interested parties can select a date from his calendar at <a href="https://calendly.com/thedavidcoen">https://calendly.com/thedavidcoen</a>.</p>
