        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rene Pickhardt presented a concept called "Price of Anarchy" which is similar to the cost of decentralization of Bitcoin and the cost of the Tragedy of the Commons. The Braess Paradox suggests that adding more roads can cause more traffic, leading to the idea of having a centralized authority that assigns who can be a forwarding server. Fee setting as flow control is another concept presented, where every channel is a marketplace where the sats inside the channel are being sold. Leakage of balance information through feerates creates privacy concerns, so some fuzzing and mitigations can be implemented to reduce the privacy leakage. The Lightning Network community is exploring various alternate strategies for fee-setting and improving gossip rates.ZmnSCPxj explains the concept of feerate cards, mapping between probability-of-success range and a feerate, stating that payers incur an opportunity cost if payment fails due to the inability to utilize the difference in subjective value between the service/product and the sats being spent. One suggestion involved generating local estimates for speed and reliability by sending onion messages or designed-to-fail HTLCs. Another idea was to use feerate cards, which map probability of success ranges to a feerate. However, one participant suggested using fee budgets as the cost of failure. All published nodes should support some kind of onchain/offchain swap capability to keep channels balanced and avoid needing to close them. ZmnSCPxj suggests that swap nodes may be more beneficial than LSPs in fixing fee imbalances and maintaining older channels. To address the issue of the network's liquidity not being balanced, it is proposed that all published nodes support onchain/offchain swap capability. Furthermore, the proposal improves the Price of Anarchy by reducing the economic rent imposed on all payers by the @zerofeerouting strategy. However, multiple people paying to the same node may worsen the effective Price of Anarchy. The article discusses the economic rationality of overcharging in Bitcoin's Lightning Network, suggesting that it may not be a dominant long-term solution, but it can work effectively on a network where most people set their feerates irrationally. Another node operator shares his thoughts on the topic, agreeing with the idea of the fee-based balance leaking strategy.In conclusion, the Lightning Network can be seen as an aggregation layer for ultimately onchain payments, and the proposal is intended to improve the efficiency of the network's liquidity. The discussion includes various ideas and suggestions for optimizing Lightning Network payments, such as using feerate cards, setting heuristics targeting a constant balance of 50%, and utilizing onchain/offchain swap capability to keep channels balanced. However, further information is needed to fully understand the context and implications of some proposals.</p>
