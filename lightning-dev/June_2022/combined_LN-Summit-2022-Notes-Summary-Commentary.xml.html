        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network (LN) protocol's latency sensitivity and its impact on payment completion time were discussed in a recent email exchange between developers. Christian Decker, a developer of the LN protocol, mentioned that slow signers should not cause too many issues, except for slower forwards in the case of routing nodes. He said that routing node signers should be well below the 1 second mark, even with more complex signer logic, including MuSig2 or nested FROST.However, Matt Corallo expressed concern about forwarding nodes taking a full second to forward payments. He believes that getting 95th percentile payments down to one second is a good goal, something that requires never having to retry payments and having forwarding nodes not take more than 150ms. Users expect payments to complete within this timeframe with multiple retries in between. If forwarding nodes start taking a full second to forward payments, it may be necessary to avoid such nodes.Peter Todd proposed the idea of allowing users to opt-in for slower payment processing for increased privacy. This could be beneficial for rebalancing and other automated processes. The idea is seen as an interesting one by some in the Bitcoin community.In terms of batch processing, the LN protocol implements a mechanism where changes are applied to the commitment transaction as a batch, which means that not every change requires a commitment and thus a signature. While a slow signer may impact payment latency, it should not have an impact on throughput on the routing nodes. Signers in a multi-signature setting for Lightning Network would add latency due to the need for additional signatures. The Lightning protocol also needs to recognize and verify Schnorr signatures, which is currently not implemented. The current plan is to use musig2 in the funding output for a single aggregated 2-of-2 key with a single multi-signature used to close the channel. This may result in added latency depending on the system architecture, but it should be normal network latency from a user's perspective.Overall, while edge nodes may benefit from relaxed timings, routers should strive to be as fast as possible.</p>
