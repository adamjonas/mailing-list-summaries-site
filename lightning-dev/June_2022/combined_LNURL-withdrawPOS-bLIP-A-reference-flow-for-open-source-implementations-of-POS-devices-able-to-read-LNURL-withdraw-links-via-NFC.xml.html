        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>David Coen has proposed a new bLIP called LNURL-withdrawPOS for a common NFC payment flow that uses the LNURL protocol. This standardization is not a new sub-protocol but rather an attempt to establish an open and common standard for the receiving part of the flow, i.e., merchant Point of Sale with NFC sensor. The LNURL-withdraw sub-protocol allows users to receive funds via Lightning Network without creating an invoice manually. The users can scan a QR code or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet to receive funds.The proposal documents a reference flow for open-source implementations of POS devices equipped with NFC sensors that can read LNURL-withdraw links. The purpose is to provide a better user experience in Lightning payments powered by the LNURL protocol. David Coen invites representatives of existing implementations to support this bLIP by adding themselves to a table available on GitHub. Before adding an implementation, it should be open source, fully interoperable, and adhere to the LNURL-withdraw specs.There are some reference implementations like BTCpay's LNURL NFC Support plugin, Coincorner's checkout system, IBEX Mercado's Point of Sale, and Fast Bitcoins's Point of Sale. David Coen is promoting the adoption of this open standard and is having calls with industry leaders like Danny Scott (Coincorner), Danny Brewster (Fast Bitcoins), and Kamil Brejcha (Dexfin Exchange). David is open to further discussions via call and provides a link to his calendar for scheduling.</p>
