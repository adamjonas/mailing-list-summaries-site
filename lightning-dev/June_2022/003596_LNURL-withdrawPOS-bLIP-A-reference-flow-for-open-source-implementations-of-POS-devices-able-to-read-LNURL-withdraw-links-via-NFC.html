    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>David Coen has submitted a pull request for a new bLIP (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal) called LNURL-withdrawPOS. The proposal is not a new LNURL sub-protocol but rather an attempt to reach an open and common standard for the receiving part of the flow (merchant Point of Sale with NFC sensor). LNURL-withdraw is a bech32-encoded HTTPS query string or sub-protocol of LNURL that allows users to receive funds via the Lightning Network without the need to manually create an invoice. Users can scan a QR code or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet to receive funds. David Coen has schematized a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS, which sees the interaction between the user and a POS equipped with an NFC sensor. This bLIP serves to document what could be a reference flow for open-source implementations of POS devices able to read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC, for better UX in Lightning payments powered by the LNURL protocol.There are solutions that already use this common flow or are going to implement it. David Coen is having calls to push the adoption of this open standard, in particular, he has been contacted by Danny Scott (Coincorner), Danny Brewster (Fast Bitcoins), and is going to have a call with Kamil Brejcha (Dexfin Exchange). The representatives of the implementations are invited to signal their support to this flow by adding themselves to the table available on GitHub and to support this bLIP.Before adding an implementation to the list, the implementation should be open source, fully interoperable, and respect the LNURL-withdraw specs (LUD03). David Coen is open to discussing this even via call and has provided a link to his calendar for scheduling.</p>
