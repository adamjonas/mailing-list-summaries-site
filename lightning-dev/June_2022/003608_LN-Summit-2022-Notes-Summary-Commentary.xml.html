    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Bastien expressed his opinion that the proposal by waxwing would not help in private gossip as the rate-limiting it provides is not enough. The proposal limits token issuance to once every N blocks where N is the age of the utxo, which can be used to get new tokens after spending the utxo, effectively doubling the capacity advertised. Although some ideas from the proposal might be useful, there needs to be a stronger link between advertised and real on-chain capacity.In the same thread, ZmnSCPxj shared waxwing's proposal posted on bitcoin-dev, which proposes a proof-of-channel-ownership mechanism that matches the requirements for lightning gossip, such as rate-limiting and keeping the mapping of UTXOs to channels private. However, a global network is needed to prevent UTXOs from being reused across services, ensuring spam-resistance.Another topic discussed was friend-of-a-friend balance sharing and probing, which aims to increase payment reliability while degrading privacy in the network. A makeshift protocol to make channel probing harder was proposed, but it sacrifices payment reliability. One attendee suggested allowing nodes to express a fee gradient via a static curve/bucket/function instead of dynamically communicating the latest state of fee+liquidity distribution. However, this proposal was misunderstood, and the intent was to provide a probability-of-success given a uniform distribution of channel balance.</p>
