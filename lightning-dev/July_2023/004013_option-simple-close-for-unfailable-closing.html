    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context provided is a pull request on GitHub for the "bolts" repository. It introduces a new protocol for closing a channel in the Lightning Network. The protocol is designed to avoid any failure scenarios caused by fee disagreement, as each side offers to pay its own desired fee. The protocol allows each side to indicate whether they want to omit their own output. The close protocol is "taproot ready" in the sense that shutdown is always sent to trigger it, so it can contain the nonces without any persistence requirement.The pull request consists of three commits:1. The first commit introduces the new protocol for closing a channel. It includes details about the closing initiation and negotiation, as well as the actions and requirements for the sender and receiver of the closing signature.2. The second commit removes the requirement that shutdown not be sent multiple times, as it was already nonsensical.3. The third commit removes the older protocols for closing a channel.The first commit provides an inline code diff for easy review. It includes changes to the "02-peer-protocol.md" file, specifically in the section related to channel close. The diff adds a subsection called "Closing Negotiation: `closing_complete` and `closing_sig`" which explains the actions and requirements for the sender and receiver of the closing signature.The second commit modifies the "03-transactions.md" file. It adds a section called "Classic Closing Transaction" and describes two possible variants for each node when sending a `closing_signed` message. It also explains the structure and requirements of the closing transaction.The third commit modifies the "09-features.md" file. It adds a new feature option called `option_simple_close`, which represents simplified closing negotiation. This feature is included in the "bolt02-simple-close" specification.Overall, this pull request introduces a new protocol for closing a channel in the Lightning Network, simplifies the closing process, and removes older protocols. It provides detailed explanations of the new protocol, the structure of the closing transaction, and the feature options related to closing negotiation.</p>
