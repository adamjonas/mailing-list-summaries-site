    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal in question suggests a scheme for sending left and right locks in a PTLC (Payment-Triggered Lightning Channel) scenario. However, the author believes that it would be more efficient to only send the delta scalar between the left and right locks to the trampoline node. The proposed scheme includes a function called "buildPath" that takes inputs such as a random source, gossip map, point, node, and scalar. This function uses a pathfinding algorithm to generate a raw path and then generates new scalars for each hop. It decorates the path with these scalars, takes the sum, and subtracts it from the input delta scalar to obtain the first hop scalar. This scalar is then added to the final or next trampoline payment point, resulting in the output PTLC point. The last hop is decorated with the delta scalar. For a flat payment function, the function can generate its own delta scalar for each attempt and pass the paths as-is to the onion encoder. The same buildPath function can be reused by a trampoline node, which would simply pass in the received delta scalar. Similarly, a payment function through trampoline nodes can also reuse the buildPath function by assigning individual deltas to each selected trampoline node.</p>
