    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Blinded paths in the context of CivKit (large-scale peer-to-peer electronic market system) can be used by market boards to ensure trade escrow over Lightning. This enables the board to enforce fair auction policies during trade execution and maintain confidentiality in dealer/breaker roles. Blinded paths, when combined with attribute-based encryption and ECC-based blinding cryptosystems, can create a more powerful system. The General Data Protection Regulation Act (GDPR) in the EU grants strong privacy rights to individuals involved in Lightning HTLC transactions. Lightning routing hops may fall under GDPR protection, entitling Lightning HTLC senders to rights such as data collection information, rectification, processing restriction, and objection to processing. US entities dealing with European personal data must comply with GDPR regulations. Pseudonymization and encryption are regarded positively under the GDPR framework. California has its own version of the GDPR, called the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gives individuals the right to opt-out of sharing their personal information. There is uncertainty regarding the boundaries of privacy rights in the cryptocurrency era. Litigation is expected in the future, but there is potential for a flourishing economy of Lightning nodes in both the EU and the US.</p>
