    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a user named fiatjaf expressed the need for Lightning Network (LN) node implementations to support self-payment of their own invoices. This feature, if implemented, would greatly benefit custodial Lightning service providers. Currently, no LN node has this ability, which is seen as unfortunate by the community.The user highlighted the importance of this feature in testing, particularly in integration testing of payment flows. Currently, this process involves spawning a secondary node and setting up a channel, which can be time-consuming even with automation on regtest. Moreover, there are instances where the testing fails due to unrelated reasons.The suggestion to request developers of underlying LN node implementations to support self-payment of invoices is seen as a significant step forward for custodial Lightning service providers. It is believed that this feature would greatly enhance their operations.Overall, the discussion emphasizes the need for the implementation of self-payment functionality within LN node implementations, highlighting its potential benefits in testing and for custodial service providers.</p>
