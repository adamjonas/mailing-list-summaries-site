    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Zeeman and Antoine are discussing the use of MuSig2 signing for commitment transactions, specifically for unilateral closes. They mention the use of OP_CHECKSIG' and storing nonces in volatile RAM instead of persistent storage to avoid disconnection issues. They also discuss the idea of using hardware devices with reasonable persistent storage instead of additional fee-bumping. Antoine mentions that many people, including himself, are writing software to measure demand and adjust prices accordingly on the Lightning Network. He refers to a proposal for "static fees" or unconditional fees and raises concerns about gossip convergence delays and rate-limitation with dynamic fees. He suggests that valuation is subjective and depends on historical forwarding HTLC traffic and other sources of information. Antoine also comments on chain height advances taking several hours in the real world and mentions the high cost for a Lightning counterparty to manipulate fees/reputation using Bitcoin as a universal clock. He proposes negotiating a "grace delay" instead of strict reputation downgrades for channel progress.</p>
