    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Hi List,I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. Since the beginning of the year, our team has been diligently recording and transcribing our specification meetings that take place every other Monday. I'm happy to report that we have successfully maintained this habit, and now I want to make these transcripts available to everyone who may find them useful.You can access the transcripts at the following link: [<a href="https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification](https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification)">https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification](https://btctranscripts.com/lightning-specification)</a>. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Gurwinder at Chaincode for his invaluable assistance in reviewing and ensuring the accuracy of these transcripts. His diligent efforts have kept the AI overlords in check, ensuring the highest quality recordings.I hope you all find these transcripts helpful in your work.</p>
