    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Blinded paths in the Lightning Network offer privacy benefits for the receiving node by hiding among an anonymous set of nodes within a certain number of hops from the introduction point. However, there is a potential downside to this approach. With blinded paths, the only way to pay the recipient is through one of the given paths, which can be used to enforce that only "compliant" nodes are used to reach a destination.In the current system, regulated businesses can choose to only open channels with trusted peers. However, with blinded paths, they could enforce that payments must go through a certain number of "compliant" nodes before reaching them. This would bypass the pleb routing nodes and force users to route their payments through large regulated hubs. While this may improve payment reliability for the receiver, it reduces the sender's privacy.The sender's privacy can be compromised because as the number of hops in the payment route increases, the sender needs to be closely connected to the introduction node or any of the nodes along the blinded path. If all these compliant nodes are sharing data, they can track a payment through basic timing analysis. This could potentially enable lightning "chain analysis" companies to strong-arm businesses into using this approach under the pretense of avoiding receiving OFAC coins.It is unclear if this is a fixable problem or a trade-off that needs to be made to achieve receiver privacy in the Lightning Network. The concern is raised for people's opinions and awareness regarding this issue.</p>
