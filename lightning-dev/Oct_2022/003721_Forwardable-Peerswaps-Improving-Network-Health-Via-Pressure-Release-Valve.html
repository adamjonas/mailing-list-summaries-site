    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the capability of forwarding offchain-to-onchain swap has been discussed. The first sub-protocol (onchain-to-offchain) is forwardable but there is a possibility of forwarding offchain-to-onchain swap by making a payjoin transaction by the net receiver and sender. Currently deployed swap servers like lightning loop and boltz have a feature called prepayment which works as DoS prevention in case of offchain-to-onchain swap. However, in the case of peerswap or any other protocol that is pseudonymous, there is a risk that after the user has paid the prepayment, the responder simply ignores it. To avoid this, paying the DoS prevention fee with an onchain transaction can help in making the prepayment and the responder's duty atomic. However, there is a catch-22 situation where end-users have Lightning funds but no onchain funds to payjoin into the onchain HTLC.</p>
