    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, John, the proposer of a modified protocol for the Lightning Network, responds to Dave's query about his proposal. Dave has reduced John's proposal into its essential ideas and wants to confirm if he has understood it correctly. John confirms that Dave's understanding is accurate, noting that dedicated user Bob has already committed himself to being able to respond to Alice's on-chain transactions within a window of b blocks. John also clarifies that Alice can submit her transaction spending the HTLC output of Bobâ€™s current Commitment transaction even before he has submitted his current Commitment transaction. Dave points out a potential issue in John's proposal regarding a malicious partner broadcasting an older revoked commitment transaction, which can win the race against Alice's latest commitment transaction. John acknowledges the problem but argues that Alice needs to monitor the blockchain regardless and suggests setting a long interval safety parameter for penalty transactions. He feels that being able to shut off her phone and not worry about the Lightning app for all but a short time every few months isn't overly onerous. The issue of how often Alice needs to monitor the blockchain is dependent on her setting of the long interval safety parameter and is independent of her ability to perform one-shot receives. The protocol that supports one-shot receives eliminates certain steps in the current Lightning protocol, which seems like a better user interface.</p>
