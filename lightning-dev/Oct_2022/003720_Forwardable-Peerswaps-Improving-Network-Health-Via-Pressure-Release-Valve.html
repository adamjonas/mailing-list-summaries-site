    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the given context, it is mentioned that Carol can disturb the protocol by invaliding the PTLC tx by using one of its inputs. However, it is also stated that there is not much point in doing so because prepayment is only for a fee for a single tx in the first place. Furthermore, it is highlighted that this approach may not work if the onchain PTLC Tx has a lot of inputs. This is because the prepayment revenue must be higher than the cost of invalidating the on-chain PTLC. Hence, it can be inferred that the feasibility of invalidating the PTLC tx depends on various factors such as the number of inputs and the prepayment revenue.</p>
