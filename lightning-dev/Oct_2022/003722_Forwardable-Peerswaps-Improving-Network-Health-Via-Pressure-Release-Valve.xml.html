    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Peerswap, a Lightning Network feature that allows two nodes to exchange funds by balancing their channels with a third-party node, may be moved to allow for up to two hops. The decision is based on concerns for reliability but it has been noted that the intermediate node also knows the state of each channel. Smart programs could automatically select an outgoing channel with high uptime and in need of balance adjustment, which would ensure success while still offering a degradation in expected reliability. Incentives for the intermediaries include two channels with improved balance for free as opposed to self-paying rebalances which have a cost. Thus, there is motivation for the intermediaries to ensure swap success, similar to ensuring payment success.</p>
