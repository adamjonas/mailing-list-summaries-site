    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The WF Protocol is a modified version of the traditional HTLC agreement in which Alice can spend the x BTC back to her wallet by first getting a trigger transaction confirmed on-chain, waiting b blocks, then getting the actual spend-back-to-wallet transaction confirmed. Bob doesn't need to take any action to lock-in an HTLC Success unless he sees the trigger transaction appear on-chain or he expects to be offline for more than b blocks. In this way, Alice can stay offline for as long as Bob can tolerate. One-Shot Receives idea involves encumbering user Bob's commitment transaction with a timelock so that he can't publish it until near the time when any HTLCs in it would expire. Alice's version of commitment would be unencumbered, so she could publish it anytime. However, in the pathological case where honest casual user Alice broadcasts the latest commitment transaction but her channel partner, malicious dedicated user Mallory, broadcasts an older revoked commitment transaction, Alice still needs to monitor the blockchain to become aware of this situation and broadcast a penalty transaction within the necessary time limit. If Alice still needs to monitor the blockchain in any case, this proposed change doesn't eliminate the underlying problem of onerous monitoring.</p>
