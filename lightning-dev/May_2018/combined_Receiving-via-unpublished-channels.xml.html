        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email conversation between Nayuta Ueno and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the implementation of `channel_update` and `channel_announcement` for their node, Ptarmigan Lightning Network. They discuss various aspects of these updates, including when they should be sent and issues related to creating invoices with `r` fields.ZmnSCPxj proposes sending `channel_update` as soon as they lock in the channel and urges other LN implementations to consider standardizing this behavior. Additionally, they discuss the issue of receiving funds via an unpublished channel and the need to know the onLightning fee rates of the other side.Nayuta-ueno asks further questions regarding `channel_updates` and `r` fields, specifically whether `channel_update` only sends for `announce_channel == 0` and if it sends every time after `funding_locked` sending. The email thread also discusses whether c-lightning checks something in the `r` field of payee's invoice.A representative from Nayuta clarifies that the `r` field does not contain a signature like `channel_update`. The entire invoice has a signature, but only the payee signature is present since the fee of the channel is the fee from the peer of the payee.Overall, the email thread provides details regarding the behavior of `channel_update` and its standardization across different Lightning Network implementations. It also highlights the issues related to creating invoices with `r` fields while receiving funds via an unpublished channel and the need to know the onLightning fee rates of the other side. The idea of sending `channel_update` as soon as they lock in the channel was proposed, and ZmnSCPxj wants to know if other LN implementations such as lnd, eclair, ucoin, lit should consider standardizing this behavior.</p>
