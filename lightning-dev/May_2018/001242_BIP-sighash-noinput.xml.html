    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Decker, a Bitcoin Core developer has requested the benevolent BIP editors (BBEs) to assign a BIP number to the SIGHASH_NOINPUT proposal. The proposal has received a positive response and lack of major criticism. Although Christian has created a simple implementation of the hashing implementation in Bitcoin Core, he believes it's unlikely to pass the review and since there has been no groundwork on witness V1 scripts, he can't test it at present. One issue that was raised off list is that some fork coins have used sighash 0x40 as FORKID. However, this does not conflict with this proposal as it only applies to segwit transactions, which the fork coins have explicitly disabled. Christian looks forward to discussing how to move forward in implementing this proposal and how multiple proposals can be combined into the next soft-fork. The implementation of SIGHASH_NOINPUT is expected to enable the Lightning Network to function more efficiently by allowing the creation of lightning channels without broadcasting to the network. This will result in cost savings for users and reduce the blockchain's load. The proposal aims to eliminate transaction malleability issues and improve privacy.</p>
