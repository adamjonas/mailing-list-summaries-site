    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj expressed interest in a recent paper on Schnorr signature aggregation and hash-based signatures. However, he noted that supporting Schnorr signatures (SS) would require a significant effort and may complicate routing implementations. Specifically, a new global feature bit, `option_support_scriptless`, would need to be added to the Lightning BOLT spec to support routing of scriptless-script conditional payments. Additionally, intra-path decorrelation, which requires passing a blinding secret to each layer of the onion in the onion routes, may also be necessary. ZmnSCPxj also questioned how well Bellare-Neven signature aggregation could work for Lightning use-cases, as there is only one input for mutual closes unless close aggregation is supported involving more than two parties. However, a 2-of-2 with a single signature could let the mutual close and commitment transactions be smaller by one signature and one pubkey.</p>
