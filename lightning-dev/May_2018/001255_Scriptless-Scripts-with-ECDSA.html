    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Benjamin Mord discusses the issue of quantum resistance and its impact on the deployment of scriptless scripts on lightning in the Bitcoin blockchain. He argues that while backups are important for every primitive used in cryptography, it is not entirely clear if lattice-based algorithms could be swapped for DL signatures on short notice. The risk of a DL break compromising funds in Bitcoin is a valid cause for concern, especially with the potential for attackers to steal multisig funding outputs directly using quantum computers. Mord suggests that additional protocol changes relying on the DL assumption shouldn't be a problem as long as there is some backup plan, like lattice cryptography, or other signature algorithms for lightning to move to. Ultimately, he believes that the global economy deserves careful consideration when it comes to cryptography and that backups should be identified at least at a conceptual level before use.</p>
