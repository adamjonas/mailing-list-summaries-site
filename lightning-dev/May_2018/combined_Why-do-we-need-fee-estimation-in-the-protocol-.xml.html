        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A member of the Lightning Network mailing list, CJP, suggested that allowing peer A to determine the fee for their own commit transaction would be a fair solution. Under this proposal, Peer A would pay the transaction fee from its part of the channel funds and could ask Peer B for a signature on an updated "commit transaction A" if they wanted to change the fee. However, Rusty Russell pointed out that this approach creates complications since HTLCs pay their own fees. Laolu Osuntokun proposed always having an "OP_TRUE" output and minimal fees in the spec to simplify the fee problems. ZmnSCPxj added that Eltoo works around this by always being a single input/output pair with SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, allowing fees to be attached later without bloat issues. However, this technique cannot be used in Poon-Dryja even with `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, since commitment transactions often have multiple outputs.</p>
