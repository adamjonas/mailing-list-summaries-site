    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the Lightning-dev community expressed concern that leaking both distances simultaneously is worse than leaking just one distance, as it can reveal who paid who. This conversation led to a discussion about the potential for asymmetrical resources to be used by a malevolent node to harm specific smaller nodes without acquiring a bad reputation. In this scenario, the boss node directs normal traffic to sacrificial nodes they control while understating the reputation risk. When the time comes, the sacrificial node inflicts delay on the victim node, and both suffer while the boss node remains unscathed. The question was raised whether understating the risk of legitimate traffic from the boss node to sacrificial node effectively allows transfer of reputation to the sacrificial node in preparation for attack while obscuring their association.</p>
