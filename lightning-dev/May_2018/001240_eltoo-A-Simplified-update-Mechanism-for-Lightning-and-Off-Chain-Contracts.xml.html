    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, the terminology used in the eltoo paper was discussed. The "setup transaction" was referred to as a "funding transaction", which caused confusion. Additionally, the script for the output of the setup transaction was found to be more complex than initially thought, and it was suggested that the bullet point describing it be clarified. It was proposed that instead of referring to the output as a "multisig", it be called a "multiparty output" and reference the script in Figure 2. It was also noted that when the trigger transaction is added later in the paper, the funding transaction output becomes a regular 2-of-2 multisig address, relegating the complex script to the output of the trigger transaction. This design allows for greater anonymity in the mutual close transaction. It was suggested to refer to "funding outpoints" rather than "funding transactions" since a single Bitcoin transaction can serve as an anchor for several channels at once. Finally, it was mentioned that having a second output (change) is permissible and may have advantages.</p>
