    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A co-author has shared a paper on the scriptless script (SS) ECDSA construction and formally proved its security and privacy guarantees. Additionally, several other constructions were described for the Lightning Network, including the SS Schnorr protocol, which was initially proposed by A. Poelstra. The paper also explains how to combine SS ECDSA and SS Schnorr without losing security or privacy, allowing interoperability between different implementations. A framework to combine script-based cryptographic locks using partially homomorphic one-way functions was also presented. Possible applications of SS ECDSA include atomic swaps where the resulting transaction no longer reveals the cryptographic condition. In the context of quantum computing, it was discussed that insecure channels could be closed if an attacker with a quantum computer tried to steal all live payments routed through them from their senders before they get to the recipient. While Scriptless Script enables new applications such as within-path decorrelation (privacy boost) and multi-path payments with proof-of-payment (functionality boost), hashlocking can serve as a fallback option, which degrades functionality and privacy but only to the level that we have today.</p>
