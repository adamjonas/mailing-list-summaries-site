        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On the lightning-dev mailing list, a discussion was held about the possibility of creating a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for Lightning Network node management. Participants suggested various features that could be included in the GUI, such as reports on transactions and the integration of nodes with existing wallets.Luke Dashjr suggested that the creation of a GUI should be transparently supported in Bitcoin Core GUI with the use of an external library. The conversation then turned towards distinguishing between wallet integration and LN node management, with Luke suggesting that he did not see a difference and why every wallet couldn't be an LN node.The topic then shifted towards endpoints and relays. It was discussed that endpoints needed to be integrated into wallets while relays were standalone with their own management console. Technical issues were raised during the discussion, such as the need for nodes to be online 24/7 and the use of existing wallets as another payment type.It was suggested that a back-end API stack with request authentication, copious logs, and some sort of authenticated web interface to view pretty graphs would be a good approach. Additionally, the possibility of having a "lite mode" client which is an endpoint was discussed, and this could be integrated with existing wallets.Overall, the discussion revolved around the potential benefits and technical considerations of creating a GUI for Lightning Network node management. There was a strong emphasis on the integration of nodes with wallets and the need for proper authentication and logging for the back-end API stack.</p>
