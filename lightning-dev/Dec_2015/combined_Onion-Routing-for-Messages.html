        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, Mats Jerratsch and Bryan Bishop discuss the implementation of onion-routing process in the Lightning Network. The original plan was to have some out-of-band messaging similar to a BIP70-style payment protocol instead of a single QR code, but this increased complexity. The proposed solution is that once a path is found, the recipient would communicate over the wallet-to-wallet channel to pass over the fully-constructed onion routing information.They also discuss the idea of having wallets open up a hidden service on TOR to take payment requests on a service listening there. The use of simplified message-delivery-system where each hop costs like 1 satoshi is also considered, which would not be enforceable on the blockchain. This message passing system would reduce message passing in onion land, which could make the problem easier to think about. If it remains a problem, they might find a way to proof this behaviour or even use HTLCs for these.Mats Jerratsch from Blockchain.com discussed the concept of onion routing and its practical uses in a message to the Lightning-dev mailing list. He proposed that payments should be routed over a rendezvous point (RP) and encrypted using an onion scheme to ensure privacy. A QR code could be used to transmit payment data and should include a payment hash in case the payment goes missing. The design could also include a messaging system integrated into the routing process. However, there are concerns over spamming and security risks.Rusty Russell commented on the two ideas presented by Jerratsch, emphasizing that reinventing a p2p messaging network is outside the current scope.</p>
