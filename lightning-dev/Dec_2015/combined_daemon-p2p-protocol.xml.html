        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Anthony Towns discusses the daemon/p2p protocol, which currently relies on protobufs with union support. Towns also delves into the use of public key cryptography in lightning, including routing keys, anchor keys, and p2p keys. However, the current p2p protocol involves risks such as revealing node identity, MITM attacks and potential DoS attacks. In discussions from October 2015, Mats Jerratsch and aj suggest adding IP-PubKey-Relationship to the gossip protocol to mitigate risks associated with lightning nodes. They also discuss the risks of MITM and eavesdropping and propose sending a shared secret nonce to avoid revealing node identity.Rusty Russell proposes using a session nonce to improve security in an email thread from October 21, 2015. Although the nonce can help with correlation, it needs to change to maintain security. Russell also acknowledges that using a nonce may overcomplicate things since nodes are already publishing their ids and IPs in a public IRC channel.In another email thread from October 2015, Anthony Towns suggests three potential uses for public key crypto in lightning: routing keys, anchor keys, and p2p keys. The Lightning Network currently relies on protobufs with union support and fixed-length fields can be implemented using custom field options.Mats Jerratsch proposes adding IP-PubKey-relationship to the gossip protocol in a forum discussion on the Lightning Network. One suggestion is to have lightning nodes run on dedicated machines and firewalled against any incoming connections. Implementing any of the above options should be delayed until there are thousands of lightning nodes.Lastly, in an email discussion, Anthony Towns highlights the sensitivity of the relationship between a network address and the lightning network address. It is suggested to implement the above-mentioned ways until there is a substantial number of lightning nodes (1000s).</p>
