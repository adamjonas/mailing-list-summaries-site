    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Mark Friedenbach and Rusty Russell discuss the estimated transaction times for Lightning Networks. Friedenbach notes that although there will be efforts to keep the network decentralized, some centralization pressure is expected due to the desire for low latency transactions. The average user's experience of a 10-hop payment is estimated to be between 1-2 seconds, with inner-hops being primarily between Tier-1 datacenter nodes selected based on network proximity. Payments closer in proximity would take under a second to complete. A network consisting entirely of last-mile endpoints geographically distributed around the world would only have a worst-case transaction time of about 10 seconds, which is doable for PoS.Rusty Russell provides an estimation assuming established channels already exist. He believes that one might expect up to 10 hops in a large lightning network with 3 RTTs per hop. Therefore, it would take approximately 30 RTTs or up to 10 seconds for Provider to receive the payment. Russell's bitcoin node latency averages 330ms in Australia.</p>
