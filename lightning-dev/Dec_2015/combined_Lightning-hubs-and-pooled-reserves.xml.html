        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email proposes a potential solution to lower the capital requirement for those interested in operating a Lightning Network node. The suggested approach involves creating a fractional-reserve banking system, which would require trust-based fractional-reserve hubs. The writer believes that this implementation could potentially lead to lower transaction fees due to the lower capital requirements. They suggest further exploration of implementing a proof-of-solvency system as a replacement for the existing fractional-reserve system. A recent GitHub gist has proposed a new approach to hubs and centralization in the Lightning Network. The current system requires reserves for each payment channel, but the author suggests creating a metatoken/coloured coin on top of Bitcoin. This would eliminate the need for the hub to hold reserves for each node it connects to. Instead, the hub would provide Hectorcoins to nodes which they can sell back to the hub for Bitcoin if they're net positive. However, this method requires counterparty trust in Hector.The author of the email invites John to discuss the matter further over Skype and commends his accessible writing style.</p>
