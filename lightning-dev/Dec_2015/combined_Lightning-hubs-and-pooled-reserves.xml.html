        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, the idea of lowering the capital requirement to run a Lightning Network node was discussed. The proposal of a trust-based system looked like a fractional-reserve banking system, and it was suggested that proof-of-solvency could replace the existing fractional-reserve system. A gist was created with images depicting the idea. The natural tendency away from hubs and centralization in lightning network was discussed, and the need for hubs to hold bitcoin in reserve for each payment channel was highlighted. An example was given where Hectorcoin was used as a metatoken/coloured coin on top of bitcoin to create a hub without tying up funds in lots of channels. Counterparty trust in Hector was needed, but the efficiency and connectedness of dealing with a hub were considered worthwhile trade-offs. Improving the hub by providing a proof of solvency and having some way for automatic exchange of Hectorcoin for value without asking Hector's permission were suggested. The author shared this idea to hear people's thoughts.</p>
