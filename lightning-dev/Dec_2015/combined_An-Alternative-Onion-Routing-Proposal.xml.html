        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The text discusses the design of onion routing in the Lightning Network, covering various aspects such as the Sphinx protocol, security and efficiency of encryption, node IDs, and backwards compatibility. The Sphinx protocol is explained as a method for achieving small mix-headers with a maximum diameter of 20 hops and a 16-byte MAC. The discussion also covers the use of ChaCha20+poly1305 over AES-CTR+HMAC-SHA-256 in routing information, the safety of 128-bit and 192-bit node IDs, and the backwards compatibility of end wallets. During a conversation between Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty Russell, the possibility of using cha cha encryption was discussed. It was suggested that packet lengths should be encrypted with a separate key to maintain confidentiality of the packet length and payload. However, Rusty noted that timing and packet boundary measurement could still determine sizes. They also discussed how to handle limited re-transmission due to nodes going down, as the protocol assumes nodes store things persistently but packet loss and connection issues can occur. In another part of the text, Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Zooko discuss the current practice of node IDs taking two forms in code: either the hash160 of a node's current pub-key or the raw serialized pub-key itself. Zooko expresses his happiness for the direction of re-using prior work-Sphinx rather than inventing a new one. Finally, Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty Russell debate the byte size of a Lightning Network header overhead and the message authentication code (MAC) used in the network. As the protocol is command/response-based, retransmission should be responded to by retransmitting the response.</p>
