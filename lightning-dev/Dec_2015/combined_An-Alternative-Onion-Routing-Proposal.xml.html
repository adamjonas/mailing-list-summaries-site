    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a scheme for the design of onion routing within the Lightning Network has turned to existing academic literature for inspiration. Two promising schemes were found: Sphinx and HORNET. Sphinx is a compact mixing format that achieves small mix-headers by including only a single group element that is deterministically re-randomized by each hop in the route. HORNET leverages Sphinx to build a low-latency, high-bandwidth onion routing protocol. However, Sphinx requires each hop to perform two asymmetric crypto operations before forwarding, which introduces performance considerations. To get around this issue, HORNET uses Sphinx to set up a duplex onion circuit between sender and receiver, which after setup, only requires nodes to compute purely symmetric crypto operations before forwarding.HORNET also provides full unlinkability for both sides through its optional rendezvous protocol, which creates a duplex onion circuit between sender and destination, allowing a level of throughput approaching 93 Gb/s. Sphinx's mix-header format includes something called the Anonymous Header (AHDR), which contains Forwarding Segments (FSes) for each hop, allowing them to decrypt the per-hop onion, revealing the next hop in the path. By storing all session-state within the onion-packet itself, HORNET avoids the need for each node in the mix-net to store per-session state, making it easier to scale in large networks.In a Lightning Network (LN) development discussion, Laolu Osuntokun and Matt Corallo discussed various aspects of the LN protocol, including the use of various encryption and hashing algorithms like chacha20+poly3015, AES-CTR+SHA-256-HMAC, and Poly1035. They acknowledged that Sphinx should be sufficient for now, even though HORNET seems a bit over-the-horizon. There was also a discussion about using serialized pub-keys for node IDs in routing info and how it might impact the choice of cipher and MAC to use. Additionally, there was mention of an idea for a graceful fallback to regular on-chain Bitcoin transactions if it is not possible to connect directly to a recipient's address.HORNET is a low-latency, high-throughput onion routing network designed for anonymous communication. To achieve sender-receiver unlinkability, HORNET uses nested AHDRs in duplex onion routes. The set-up protocol involves the sender obtaining current keys for each hop in the path and constructing a forward and backward path. The source node constructs two initial AHDRs, one so it can send messages to the destination via the circuit, and the other which will allow the destination to reply to the source. HORNET uses 192-bit node IDs for anonymity.</p>
