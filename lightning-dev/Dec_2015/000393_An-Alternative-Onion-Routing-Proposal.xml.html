    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Zooko expresses his happiness for the direction of re-using prior work-SPHINX rather than inventing a new one. He also mentions about two options-AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA-256 and ChaCha20+poly1035 and prefers the latter. Regarding node ids, he is not sure how costly long node ids are in this context as well as how many node ids will exist in the long run. He suggests 192-bit nodeids based on some links he shared. He feels confident that 192-bit nodeids are safe enough. Zooko discusses with Rusty Russell about modifying the handshake to include a prefix and upgrade the crypto later by appending a key for a different system. They both agree that it is a must-read for any implementer. They also discuss strengthening the weakest point of the system by mixing persistent state, platform CSPRNG and unique/private information from the current protocol state.</p>
