    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Luke and Denis are discussing the idea of creating a GUI for Lightning Network (LN) node management. Luke suggests that it would be beneficial to have this functionality supported in Bitcoin Core's GUI using an external library. However, Denis has a specific use case in mind where someone running an intermediary LN node would want to compare fees from the current month to the previous month. He asks if this is a real use case and suggests implementing it as a web application that connects to the LN node backend. It seems that the discussion is focused on the practicality and usefulness of a GUI for LN node management. Luke is interested in integrating this functionality into Bitcoin Core's GUI while Denis is exploring a specific use case and proposing a web application approach. The conversation is brief but provides insight into the potential benefits and challenges of creating a GUI for LN node management.</p>
