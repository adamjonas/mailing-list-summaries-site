        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A Twitter user @DenGorbachev has asked a question regarding the time it should take for a provider to receive payment in a simple case of "Consumer - Relay - Provider" (2 hops). However, no further information was provided about these intermediaries or their roles. The article discusses the time taken for a provider to receive payment in this scenario. It takes three round-trip times (RTTs) per hop, which means 30 RTTs in ten hops in a large lightning network. With bitcoin node latency averaging at 330ms in Australia, the entire process would take around 10 seconds.The Lightning network is designed to keep latency low for transactions while remaining decentralized. The average user can expect a 10-hop payment to take between 1-2 seconds, with the inner-hops being between Tier-1 datacenter nodes primarily with payment channels chosen based on network proximity. A 'near' payment to someone closer to them would be under a second. However, even a network consisting entirely of last-mile endpoints geographically distributed around the world would only have a worst-case transaction time of only about 10s or so. Rusty Russell provides an example of a "Consumer - Relay - Provider" (2 hops) and estimates that up to 10 hops in a large lightning network could take up to 30 RTTs, which translates to around 10 seconds of transaction time.In an email thread, Mark Friedenbach and Rusty Russell discuss the estimated transaction times for Lightning Networks. Friedenbach notes that although there will be efforts to keep the network decentralized, some centralization pressure is expected due to the desire for low latency transactions. Payments closer in proximity would take under a second to complete. A network consisting entirely of last-mile endpoints geographically distributed around the world would only have a worst-case transaction time of about 10 seconds, which is doable for PoS. Rusty Russell provides an estimation assuming established channels already exist. He believes that one might expect up to 10 hops in a large lightning network with 3 RTTs per hop. Therefore, it would take approximately 30 RTTs or up to 10 seconds for the Provider to receive the payment. Russell's bitcoin node latency averages 330ms in Australia.</p>
