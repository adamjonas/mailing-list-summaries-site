    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Denis Gorbachev initiated a discussion on the idea of writing a GUI for LN node management through an email on December 13, 2015. He requested suggestions and feedback from the group members about the same. In response to Denis's query, Luke expressed his opinion about having the GUI integrated with Bitcoin Core GUI using an external library. Luke suggested that instead of creating a separate GUI for LN node management, it would be better if the GUI is supported transparently in Bitcoin Core GUI, which can be achieved by integrating an external library. This would make it easier for users to manage their LN nodes without having to switch between different interfaces. Overall, the discussion revolved around the possibility and feasibility of developing a GUI for LN node management and the potential features that could be included in such a tool.</p>
