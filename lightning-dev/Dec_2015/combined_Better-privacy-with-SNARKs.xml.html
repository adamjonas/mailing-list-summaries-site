    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation discussed potential methods for forcing someone to reveal the private key corresponding to a public key in secp256k1. One method proposed was using a script that requires generating a signature with a public key that produces parameters with a combined total of 15 leading zero bytes or more. Another suggested approach involved the use of elliptic curve keys, which allows for revealing private keys without SNARKs.The conversation also explored the cost of closing a channel and committing to an HTLC, discussing different HTLC structures. Rusty Russell suggested changing R at each step in the route in Lightning Network's onion routing to limit privacy issues. However, doing so is challenging since forwarding nodes need to calculate R1 from R2 to send a HTLC payable on R2 after receiving a HTLC payable on R1.To address this issue, the author proposed using SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to improve privacy in Lightning transactions. In particular, they suggested using SNARKs to verify the secrets used in Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) without revealing those secrets on-chain. They provided code for generating and verifying SNARKs, which takes about a minute to generate and 0.5 seconds to verify. While the cost of verification is currently high compared to other operations, it is still relatively low in terms of transaction fees. However, the author acknowledged that more work needs to be done to ensure that SNARKs are being used correctly and that the crypto is sound. Additionally, implementing this proposal would require significant changes to the way Lightning transactions are conducted, both for merchants and consumers.Furthermore, the conversation considered an alternative approach using multisig verify and compared it to other options. However, adding opcodes to Bitcoin seems difficult, and the segregated witness proposal introduced new opcodes to make it easier. Nevertheless, this method has its own issues, such as 8 sigops per output, which is about equivalent to 400B per output given the relationship between the bytes-per-block and sigops-per-block limits.</p>
