    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Two developers have built an MVP for an invoicing tool that issues an LN invoice and then pays it out to a merchant's BTC account. They are currently seeking input on better technical approaches as they were unable to find a non-custodial way to support lightning to lightning payments. They are interested in facilitating non-custodially lightning invoice generation. The developers are skeptical about the adoption of this tool due to Bitcoin price volatility, making it too volatile to be useful to customers and merchants. They also have concerns about fraudulent merchants creating payment links and the image/brand of Trelis vis-a-vis the merchants that it serves. The two extremes for the approach Trelis could take are No Verification or Use Verification. Additionally, they are concerned about regulatory status if merchants make use of Trelis software to build a payments page.</p>
