        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Concerns have been raised about KYC Node Verification and Payment Reason Aggregation in the Lightning Network. The use of the tagged field in Bolt11 invoices is being exploited by bad actors to exploit unsuspecting users in regulated spaces. Bottlepay was cited as an example of a company that forces users to verify their node by creating a specialized invoice with personally identifiable information (PII) in the description field, which can then be stored and shared with third parties, regulators, and governments. This practice could have lasting effects on the reputation-based system of the Lightning Network if it were to become more widespread.There are also concerns about payment reason aggregation revealing personal information that could be collected by third-party analytic aggregators. This could lead to censorship problems and shared transactions with malicious parties. One suggestion is to clearly communicate to users that the information put in invoices can be verified by third parties and ideally remove descriptions completely. Using the tagged field description hash h instead of description d might help, but there are UX considerations that may not solve the problem. It is recommended to save the description to the wallet database instead of putting it in the invoice. The lack of description support will help hinder the ability for mass surveillance in the Lightning space.The discussion also revolves around the idea of keeping description hash for a use case that can enable AOPP-style verification. However, this requires extreme node-level KYC enforcement. While better education can replace it, it surely helps. The slippery slope is a fallacious argument, and the specific regulation only aims at proving that one is not paying someone else, allowing exchanges to avoid registering as banks without tracking people. The conversation also discusses how regulators may get worse in the future with discussions about DOXing the sender of a payment by signing a message in a TLV field. While the only serious discussion proposed making it unlinkable, the recipient would not know which node it was. Ideally, fixing private nodes should be among top priorities. Invoices and payment reasons are being aggregated in mass, and the discussion centers around how to stop this now except by removing the ability for it to happen. However, making it meaningless is a possibility. Regardless, people need to be educated never to put invoices from others into any KYC wallet. Fixing privacy issues like ID reuse is much more important and productive than removing description.</p>
