    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the explicit tagging of fee accounts being bad design, and how having an explicit key required means pre-planning. It is better to always be able to fee bump. CPFP would work for transactions that are low-fee. The necromancing attack mostly targets users of RBF who want to add further outputs when RBF-ing. However, there is no actual entity that currently acts this way to my knowledge. Additionally, it is a nuisance attack and not an economic-theft attack. There is no gain for the attacker and they can only pay to impose costs on somebody else. Therefore, the only winning move is not to play. It is also noted that such a feature to make a lowball send transaction now and add another send later has not been implemented in any Bitcoin wallet yet.</p>
