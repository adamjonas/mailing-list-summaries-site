        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer named Jozef Hutko reached out to the Lightning Network Development mailing list with some questions about Atomic Multi-path Payments (AMP) invoices. He was working on a project using LND with AMP invoices, but it seemed like there weren't any mobile lightning wallets that could send sats to them. Laolu Osuntokun responded to Jozef's inquiry and provided some important information. Osuntokun explained that wallets built on lnd v0.14 should be able to send to reusable AMP invoices, while wallets built on lnd v0.13 could only send to them once unless they manually specified the `set_id` flag to a random value for any subsequent sends. Osuntokun also addressed Jozef's question about the future of AMP and if it could become a standard. He viewed it as the successor to keysend and explained that the next step was to finalize the current spec draft and propose it as either a BOLT or a bLIP. Osuntokun acknowledged that this had been on his TODO list for some time, but he hoped to get to it over the next few weeks. Finally, Osuntokun mentioned that when PTLCs are eventually rolled out across the network, AMP could be updated to use discrete-logs instead of payment hashes, known as Discrete Log Atomic Multi-Path (DAMP). In addition, AMP could support receiver secret-reveal by combining each share with a receiver-specified public key.Overall, Osuntokun provided helpful insights into AMP and its potential future as a standard.</p>
