    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread discussing the design of fee accounts, James O'Beirne points out that requiring an explicit key means pre-planning is necessary. This can be problematic if the vault is meant to distribute funds over many years, as a specific pre-committed key must be maintained. In the event that the key is compromised, the ability to bump may be affected. Additionally, if someone does a low fee transaction that requires a bump, but opts out, it may be better to always be able to fee bump. In response to a previous email regarding replacement transactions, ZmnSCPxj clarifies that the point is not that this should never happen, but rather that it should not happen more often.</p>
