    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj, a Drivechain developer, has presented a quiz to identify those who understand Drivechain technology. The quiz contains questions related to the security model and process of Drivechain. It includes information about the number of blocks required for stealing coins from a Drivechain sidechain, how many withdrawals can take place per year, and which types of people should use the withdrawal system. Additionally, it explains how atomic swaps improve user experience and security. The quiz also covers the parameters b and m in the Drivechain security model and how they are used to deter sc-theft. Finally, it discusses the impact of Drivechain on altcoin investors and two maximalist groups that would be slightly harmed by its success.</p>
