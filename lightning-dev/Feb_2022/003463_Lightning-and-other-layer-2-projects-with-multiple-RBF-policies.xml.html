    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The security of Lightning Network and other Layer 2 projects is partly dependent on policy rules in a way that the base blockchain/network isn't, however, this is not a reason to abandon current designs in the absence of an alternative that offers a strictly superior security model. Users are free to run different policy rules without making policy rules effective consensus rules. The maintainer(s) and contributors to Bitcoin Knots can determine what default policy rules they want to implement, and users can choose whatever policy they want. Research into Lightning security is still nascent, and we have no idea whether alternative Layer 2 projects will thrive or have conflicting security considerations to Lightning. As for incentives, most users will run whatever the defaults are, but users who have a stake in the security of Lightning or other Layer 2 projects will clearly want to run whatever policy rules are beneficial to those protocols.With such strong dominance of Bitcoin Core, there is the option to set defaults that are widely used. If certain defaults can bolster the security of Lightning and possibly other Layer 2 projects at no cost to full node users with no interest in those protocols, we should discuss what those defaults should be. The recent improvements suggested for RBF policy are not only focused on Lightning security, but the Lightning Network being the most widely adopted Layer 2 project, most of the focus has been on Lightning security. Bitcoin Knots policy is fully configurable, even in the GUI, and users can readily choose whatever policy they want.</p>
