        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Lightning Labs CEO Olaoluwa Osuntokun has proposed a way to compensate nodes for forwarding onion messages by adding an upfront session creation phase that uses AMP tender messaging. This would involve an explicit session creation phase, with the receiver being able to accept/deny the session and all nodes in the session route being compensated for allotting a certain amount of bandwidth to the session. The proposal suggests using AMP to extend push payment to a receiver for the purchase of bandwidth sessions. Two new TLVs have been added to the node_ann message to allow nodes to express their willingness to forward messages and how much they charge per byte and per block for forwarding.The proposed system supplements the existing fee revenue of nodes and could make it more sustainable to run a Lightning node. Laolu and Rusty also discussed using HTLCs for sending data and rate limiting events, as well as charging for forwarding onion messages. The proposed system expands the scope of LN to support pseudonymous messaging and arbitrary data transfer across the network.</p>
