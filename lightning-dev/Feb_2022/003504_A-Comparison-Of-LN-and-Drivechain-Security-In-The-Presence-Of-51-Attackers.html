    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Paul and ZmnSCPxj, a quiz was presented to test one's understanding of Drivechain. Correct answers include the fact that DC can not make miner-theft impossible by changing it to a layer1 consensus rule, the number of blocks required for 100% hashrate to steal coins from a DC sidechain (13,150), and the two types of people who should use the DC withdrawal system - miners destroying the sidechain and aggregators of sidechain-to-minechain transfers and large whales. Atomic swaps are the recommended method for everyone else to move their coins from chain to chain. The parameters b and m in the DC security model stand for how much profit a mainchain miner expects from supporting a sidechain and how much people want to kill a sidechain respectively. A sidechain-attribute that could cause m to be above 1 is if the sidechain is a total scam, or if a bug is found that negates any security it might have. DC is designed to deter sc-theft for a range of m.If theft across all ranges of m were magically deterred, it would be bad for sidechain users in general because the sidechain would already be part of mainchain consensus. If there were an imminent victim of a DC-based theft, using a mainchain UASF to prohibit future theft-withdrawals would only affect non-DC users who care, as they may counterattack with an opposite UASF, causing a chainsplit.Scaling technology for BTC network may become uncompetitive if it does not enable hyperbitcoinization fast enough, which is different from caring about a sidechain's m and b. Finally, if DC were successful, Altcoin-investors would be harmed, and two maximalist-groups would also be slightly harmed, but the groups were not identified.</p>
