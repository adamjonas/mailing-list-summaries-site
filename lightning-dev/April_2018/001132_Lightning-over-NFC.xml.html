    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer suggests that lightning can be used for everyday retail payments. They envision a system that is instantaneous and encodes an HTML receipt in bolt11 for the payer's reference. The writer has been running an instance of c-lightning on Android and experimenting with payments via NFC, using an NFC USB dongle as a point-of-sale terminal. There are two ways to use NFC-enabled phones - as passive tag readers or in card emulation mode. Encoding bolt11 to passive tags works as expected by setting the right MIME type and opening the app that handles the lightning payment. Communication between two lightning nodes can be done over NFC or even Bluetooth through card emulation mode, which enables two-way communication and ad hoc connection to the lightning network. The writer settled on a MIME type (application/lightning) and an NFC application ID (LIGHTNING), along with a simple protocol to forward socket data. However, they suggest that standards should be agreed upon for interoperability, but are unsure of how to proceed.</p>
