    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between two individuals discusses the use of Numerifides transactions, which are decentralized and human-readable trust. One person suggests using mappings in a sane way and not allowing pushdata2/4 if 255 bytes are enough. However, implementing scriptpubkey would require changes to miner software and support from large numbers of mining pools. To address this concern, one solution provided was to publish the command in the witness vector and use an intermediate transaction to put extra data into the cheaper witness area. The economic incentive of storing and sharing all the Numerifides mappings is also discussed. One's economic incentive to store the mappings is to avoid being fooled by a revoked mapping or to locate a needed mapping. Sharing mappings could be incentivized through a "tit for tat" strategy where peers give you a few mappings for free but stop sharing if you do not reciprocate. However, this requires a durable identity which may be undesirable. Overall, bitcoin-dev is suggested as a resource for more ideas and prior art for similar systems.</p>
