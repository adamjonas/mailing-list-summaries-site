    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email discussion thread, Tyler H and Robert Olsson proposed a new BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) to solve the challenge of end-users connecting to nodes with enough liquidity to pay every merchant. They suggest that domain operators could create SRV records for their nodes, which would allow users to look up a domain and find advertised nodes to connect to or open channels with. This could improve security by preventing nodes from masquerading as others and enable domain operators to provide subdomains for their node addresses. However, Christian Decker raised concerns about selective attachment to the node of a merchant, privacy issues, and the creation of a network of large hubs that are weakly interconnected. Tyler suggested that opening random connections biased towards strengthening overall connectivity could be encouraged and implemented. He also addressed possible open questions regarding spoofed payment requests and DNS hijacking, stating that caution would be necessary and cryptographic means of associating nodes and their associated domains could be a requirement. Overall, the proposed BOLT aims to improve the user experience and provide an additional means to advertise official nodes to ease clients onto the network.</p>
