    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to create an additional BOLT (tentatively BOLT 12) to allow operators of domain names to create SRV records for their nodes, thereby allowing users to independently look up and connect to that domain's advertised nodes and open channels. This would improve security by reducing the risk of nodes masquerading as other nodes and provide subdomains to distinguish between nodes intended for a specific purpose. Christian expressed concerns about the selective attachment to a merchant's node, stating that it is not beneficial for either the node opening the channel or the network as a whole. He believes that channels should be opened ahead of time to avoid on-chain confirmations during the first payment, and that future payments going through a single merchant could result in the creation of user profiles by that merchant. Additionally, this could create a network of large hubs that are only weakly interconnected unless the merchants maintain connections among each other. However, Christian does like the possibility of looking up a merchant's node ID through DNS to optimize connectivity. Tyler and Robert have created a draft RFC for the proposed BOLT, and feedback is appreciated.</p>
