    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Lightning Network, Daniel proposes a solution to address the concern of channel closure asymmetry. He suggests scaling the delay of the other side's closure based on the balance of the channel. If the side unilaterally closing the channel has zero balance, the other side gets no delay and symmetry as measured by (coins locked) * (duration of lock) equals zero on both sides. When the side closing the channel has at least 50% of the balance, both sides must wait the full delay. However, he notes that an attacker could still perform a costless attack in the situation where funding a new channel is required. The group agrees that asymmetry remains a concern and suggests other ways for attackers to misbehave.</p>
