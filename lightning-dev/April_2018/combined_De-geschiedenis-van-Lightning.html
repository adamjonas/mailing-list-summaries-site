        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On April 3, 2018, Aaron van Wirdum, a writer, reached out to Corné on the Lightning-dev list via email. His purpose was to gather information about Amiko Pay for an in-depth article he was working on about the history of the Lightning Network. As part of his research, Aaron wanted to include a paragraph about Amiko Pay, a predecessor to the Lightning Network. He specifically asked Corné if Amiko Pay aligned with the concept outlined in the Lightning Network white paper. Additionally, Aaron sought insights into the similarities and differences between Amiko Pay and Ripple.With the deadline for his article approaching the next day, Aaron had already completed most of his work but still had gaps to fill, particularly regarding the section on Amiko Pay. He hoped to receive a prompt response from Corné and provided his IRC contact information for further communication.In summary, Aaron van Wirdum was writing an extensive historical article on the Lightning Network and needed information about Amiko Pay. He contacted Corné Plooy to inquire about the resemblance of Amiko Pay to the Lightning Network white paper's concept and its comparison to Ripple. Aaron also requested any additional details on old proposals, concepts, or ideas that played a role in the development of both Lightning and Amiko Pay. Despite having made significant progress on the article, Aaron awaited Corné's response before finalizing the section on Amiko Pay.</p>
