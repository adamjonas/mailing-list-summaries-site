        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Aaron van Wirdum is working on an article that explains the history of Lightning Network and its predecessors, including Amiko Pay. He reached out to Corné for more information as he was not able to find enough relevant data about it. Aaron wants to add a paragraph about Amiko Pay in his article and has a few questions. Firstly, he wants to know about the similarities and differences between Amiko Pay and Lightning Network and why it worked or didn't work. Secondly, he wants to know how Amiko Pay was similar to Ripple and if there were any changes over time and whether it was Ripple old-style, new-style, or both. Additionally, Aaron is asking for suggestions from Corné for any old proposals, concepts, or ideas related to the history of Lightning and/or Amiko Pay that played a significant role in their success. The deadline for the article is the following day. Aaron hopes to hear back from Corné soon and can be contacted on IRC as well.</p>
