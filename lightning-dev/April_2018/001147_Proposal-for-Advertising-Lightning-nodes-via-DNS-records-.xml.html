    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed BOLT 10 for Lightning Network is intended to improve user experience and provide an additional means of advertising "official" nodes to ease clients onto the network, but it should only be used as a fallback solution. The intention is to provide fallback mechanisms and user-friendly ways of finding the right nodes. Tyler proposed a method for finding nodes operated by the owners of domains and subdomains that would allow users to associate a payment request with a domain safely. However, DNS hijacking is not an unlikely scenario, and caution would be necessary. Tyler suggests allowing cryptographic means of associating nodes and their associated domains to exist. In addition, Tyler proposes negotiating a channel open with a push amount and providing the TXID or payment hash as proof of payment. The merchant does have the ability to know when a payment transits the channel, thus reducing privacy. Tyler suggests node operators use autopilot-like functionality for opening channels, but they will be able to augment that with looking up common stores and merchants' domain records and open their own channels to them to provide alternate routes to popular anticipated destinations for payments. Tyler believes this will make their own node more valuable and increase the decentralization of the network.</p>
