    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a technical discussion, the issue of invalidations in a branching tree structure was raised. The use of 1 bit sequence diffs was cited as the main cause for an increase in invalidations. A specific example was given where a branching factor of 46 and a tree depth of 11 resulted in 1.48e11 updates. The conversation then turned to the imposition of a total of 288 blocks wait time. A series of updates were listed, each with a different combination of trees, and it was asked how the total wait time of 288 blocks was being maintained.</p>
