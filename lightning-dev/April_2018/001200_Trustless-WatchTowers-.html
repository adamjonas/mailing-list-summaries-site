    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Conner and ZmnSCPxj discusses the need for changes in lightning network code to prevent attackers from exploiting the network. The proposed changes would require detection of spent commitment outputs and second-level transactions, and forgoing the sweeping of already spent second-level transactions. The email also mentions the possibility of creating a new BOLT document to formalize the approach, but acknowledges that there are still implementation details to be addressed. The proposal aims to separate the commitment outpoints from the HTLC outpoints in order to prevent the broadcasting of the commitment transaction before the CLTVs expire. The discussion concludes with agreement on the proposed changes being a reasonable compromise between the tradeoffs at hand and the potential for future improvements.</p>
