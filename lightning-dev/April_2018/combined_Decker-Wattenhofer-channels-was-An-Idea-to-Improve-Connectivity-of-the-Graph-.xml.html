        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj is wondering about how HTLCs are offered under Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channels. According to the Decker-Wattenhofer construction, the transaction sequence is funding -> trigger -> (relative-timelock) invalidation tree -> ... (relative-timelock) invalidation tree. The outputs of the final invalidation tree transaction splits up the contents of the funds between the payer and payee in the individual simplex channels that compose the duplex channels. However, HTLCs have an absolute timelock, so ZmnSCPxj is uncertain how those are forced into compatibility with the relative timelock the invalidation tree uses. Under Poon-Dryja channels, the relative-timelock exists only on the claim transaction after a unilateral commitment transaction. HTLCs are offered as outputs of the unilateral commitment transaction so that the relative-timelock on the main output does not interfere with their normal operation. The HTLC-timeout case, the relative timelock is relative to the absolute one that comes first. This seems likely to affect Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories which use invalidation trees internally also, which come before the HTLCs they eventually pay out to.ZmnSCPxj suggests terminating Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories into Poon-Dryja channels to keep the locktimes involved relatively small for the number of updates we can support. He also suggests imposing some rules such as having three or more members, each member puts an equal amount, and channels to be fixed in cyclic superhub structure to save blockspace.</p>
