        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj seeks clarification on how Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) are offered under the Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channels, which uses an invalidation tree to split funds between payer and payee in individual simplex channels. The issue at hand is how HTLCs with absolute timelocks can be compatible with the relative timelock used by the invalidation tree. This is contrasted with Poon-Dryja channels, where the relative-timelock only exists on the claim transaction after a unilateral commitment transaction. The suggestion is to terminate these channels into Poon-Dryja channels with smaller relative locktimes to allow for more frequent updates while keeping the locktimes involved relatively small.The precision of `cltv_delta` should also be adjusted for channels created inside a channel factory due to the relative locktime consumed by the invalidation tree structure. Another suggestion made is to not allow channel factories to enable channel reorganization. Instead, funding transactions that fund the entire factory could be confirmed on-chain, followed by an off-chain split transaction that funds multiple channels, and finally commitment transactions that spend from the split transaction. In case of a multilateral close where all channel factory owners are available for closing, the split and commitment transactions can be collapsed into a single close transaction. Overall, ZmnSCPxj expresses concern that the issue of how HTLCs are handled under Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories, which use invalidation trees internally before paying out HTLCs, needs clarification.</p>
