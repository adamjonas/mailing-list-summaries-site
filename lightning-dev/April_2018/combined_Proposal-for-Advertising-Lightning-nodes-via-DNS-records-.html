        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a network of payment channels that enables fast and low-cost transactions. However, connecting to nodes with enough liquidity to pay every merchant and finding the merchant node in a reasonable way to open a channel for payments can be challenging. To address this issue, Tyler and Robert Olsson proposed an additional BOLT 12, allowing operators of domain names to create SRV records for their nodes, improving security and enabling users to independently look up advertised nodes and connect/open channels. While this proposed feature could improve user experience, there are concerns about privacy, and it should only be used to enhance user experience, not as a replacement for the decentralized nature of Lightning. Additionally, if implemented, this would be only a fallback solution. There is also discussion about managing risk when public and private nodes are owned by the same economic entity. Tyler concludes that his proposal should be at most a convention, but not a standard, and nodes should not trust DNS.In addition, there is a need for secure and human-understandable node names without compromising decentralization. Different approaches have been proposed such as registering first-come-first-serve on a blockchain like Namecoin or using Web of Trust. However, these approaches have their limitations such as name squatting and lack of protection against trusted parties lying. Numerifides is a proposed solution that seems to solve Zooko's triangle by committing directly to Bitcoin blockchain without the squatting problems of Namecoin. It also allows consensus review.The Lightning Network was discussed in an email thread where ZmnSCPxj suggested modifications to avoid bloating the blockchain with non-financial data. Tyler argued that there is value in having data live in the base chain for accessibility and censorship resistance. Robert expressed concerns about the selective attachment of a merchant node and its impact on user experience and privacy. Tyler and Robert proposed an additional BOLT, tentatively scheduled as BOLT 12, to allow for operators of domain names to create SRV records for their nodes, allowing users to independently find advertised nodes and connect/open channels.The Numerifides design uses the gossip overlay for censorship resistance by sharing commands to peers on the network. The design also utilizes P2WSH, so 51% miners cannot censor commands. There is an economic incentive to store all the Numerifides mappings to avoid being fooled with a revoked mapping or inability to locate a desired mapping.The context discusses the risks associated with running a public node and one or more private nodes in the Lightning Network. If a public node is hacked, all the funds can be stolen from it. It is suggested that using only a public node is better for risk management. Multiple public nodes can also be used for load distribution, and implementation diversity can be achieved by using different secure operating systems, hardware, and Lightning Network node software for each node. DNS cannot be trusted as part of the Lightning spec.In a recent message on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Bitcoin developer ZmnSCPxj discussed the concept of "circular channels." According to ZmnSCPxj, circular channels allow for load distribution between two entities that trust each other. However, ZmnSCPxj warns against making both entities trust each other for the sake of hackability.</p>
