        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Igor Cota, a developer from Codex Apertus Ltd, is experimenting with using Lightning for everyday retail payments. He has been running an instance of c-lightning on Android and making payments via NFC. To make QR codes more practical, he suggests encoding a fancy HTML receipt in bolt11 for the payers' future reference. In order to address censorship concerns, he proposes having the payer's authenticated connection to a trusted server through the Internet connection provided by the payee. This can be smaller than a smartphone but larger than a credit card. While there are two basic ways to use NFC-enabled phones today, as passive tag readers or in card emulation mode, Igor's payment terminal would provide a connection to the Internet-in-general instead of the payment terminal node.ZmnSCPxj, another developer, suggests that direct communication is required to initiate a payment to anyone on the network who has a direct channel. However, the purpose of the payment terminal is to be the node that receives the payment. In order to enable ad hoc connections to the Lightning network, Igor settled on a MIME type and an NFC application ID. He suggests that standards should be agreed upon for interoperability, but is unsure of how to proceed.Although there may be potential abuse for these types of payments, people are less likely to scam others if they are physically present. Igor proposes a new approach to connecting the Lightning Network via Near Field Communication (NFC). In card emulation mode, two-way communication is possible, allowing for an ad hoc connection to the Lightning Network. After some handshaking, the phone can tell the terminal that it wants to connect to Lightning via NFC. All communication between these nodes can then be done over NFC or even Bluetooth in situations where mobile data is not available. Igor suggests using a simple protocol to forward socket data.</p>
