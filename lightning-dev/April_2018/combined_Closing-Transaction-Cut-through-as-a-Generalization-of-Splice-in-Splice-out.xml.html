        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The proposed alternative to a splice-in/splice-out is a "cut-through" for a channel close transaction. This allows both sides to provide signed normal transactions that spend the outputs and cooperatively create a new close transaction that cuts through the original close transaction and the additional normal transactions. This generalization is useful if one wants to "reseat" a channel to another peer, which could be done off-chain if both peers and the node belong to the same channel factory.ZmnSCPxj suggests presenting a `reseatchannel` command at c-lightning RPC level to transfer the remaining funds of a channel from one peer to a new channel to another. `Multifundchannel` creates a new channel factory with this node and all nodes listed in the multi-fund operation as members of the factory. `Reseatchannel` is an offchain channel reorganization request to the factory.The proposal suggests using tx formatted messages to transport the intent, reconnecting to the idea of cut-through, combining multiple transactions into one. Although this may complicate state tracking, it is believed that eventually, transactions will assume multiple roles anyway.</p>
