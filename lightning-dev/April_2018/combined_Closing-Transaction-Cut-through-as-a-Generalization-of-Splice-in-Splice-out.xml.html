        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj and Christian discuss the connection between channel factories, with ZmnSCPxj suggesting that a way to invalidate a prior funding transaction is necessary for reseat without needing a cut-through. He proposes introducing a `reseatchannel` command at c-lightning RPC level to transfer remaining funds of a channel from one peer to another. The `multifundchannel` creates a new channel factory, while `reseatchannel` is an off-chain channel reorganization request to the factory.The proposed alternative to splice-in/splice-out ("channel top-up") is implementing a "cut-through" for a channel close transaction. Both sides would provide signed normal transactions to create a new close transaction that cuts through the original close transaction and additional normal transactions. This generalization would allow reseating a channel to another peer using the closing transaction cut-through in a single on-chain transaction if both peers and the node belong to the same channel factory.</p>
