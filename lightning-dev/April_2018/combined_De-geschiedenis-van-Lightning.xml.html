        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>On 3rd April 2018, Aaron van Wirdum, a writer, contacted Corné on the Lightning-dev list in order to request information about Amiko Pay. He wanted to add a paragraph about the predecessor to the Lightning Network in his comprehensive article on the history of the network. Aaron was interested in whether Amiko Pay resembled the concept described in the Lightning Network white paper and how it differed from Ripple. He also asked for suggestions regarding old proposals, concepts, or ideas that had played a role in the evolution of both Lightning and Amiko Pay.Although Aaron had already written most of the article, there were still gaps that needed filling, such as the section on Amiko Pay. The deadline for the article was the following day, so Aaron hoped to receive a response from Corné soon. He provided his IRC contact details for Corné's convenience.</p>
