        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj and Conner Fromknecht had a conversation about the need for a new BOLT document for a proposed approach. During the discussion, they talked about an attack technique that an attacker might use if only a single justice transaction claims all HTLC outputs. They discussed how this can be resolved by allowing watchtowers to spend them independently. The WatchTower concept in the Lightning Network has been criticized for its vulnerabilities to hacking. ZmnSCPxj discussed the WatchTower protocol used in lnd and described an encrypted blob approach where hints and blobs are sent to the WatchTower to enhance security. However, there is still a need to modify the code of c-lightning and other implementations to improve watchtower efficiency and prevent attackers from sweeping each HTLC output independently.Laolu and ZmnSCPxj also exchanged ideas regarding the implementation of a trustless WatchTower. On the Lightning-dev mailing list, Conner Fromknecht discussed the implementation of a trustless WatchTower solution where the watchtower only acts if second-stage transactions are confirmed. The conversation focused on how to handle HTLCs with 2x commitment transactions and the possibility of saving signature data to reduce complexity when reconstructing HTLC redeem scripts.To create (txid[:16], blob) pairs for the commitment transaction, and separate (txid[:16], blob) pairs for each second-stage HTLC transaction, ZmnSCPxj proposed a way to upload all the information to the WatchTower. The discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list was centered on implementing a trustless WatchTower in the Lightning Network. The concern raised was that the WatchTower could potentially cooperate with the counterparty to steal channel funds by creating a justice transaction output to themselves and the counterparty.</p>
