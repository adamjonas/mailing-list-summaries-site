    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email proposes a new invoice pattern that contains a Bitcoin address for onchain transfer as backup. The motivation behind this proposal is to have an app wallet that works in a totally abstract and transparent way onchain and/or LN depending on the situation. The Phoenix wallet almost achieves this, but there is still a certain LN/onchain distinction that confuses users. The author of the email uses Phoenix daily and experienced payment failure while trying to pay a friend. Although it was not clear why, the author managed to transfer to Breeze and from there was finally able to transfer to the final destination. These exception cases greatly confuse non-expert users. The proposed solution is to embed a Bitcoin address on the invoice so that if a payment fails, the wallet could simply ask: "Couldn't send via LN, do you want to send onchain at XPTO rate?" This would provide an immediate onchain backup alternative, useful especially when rates are low. The format of the proposed invoice pattern is given in the email along with an example.</p>
