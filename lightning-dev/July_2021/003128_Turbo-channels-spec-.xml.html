    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Martin, the creator of an idea on Bitcoin's lightning network, has suggested adding one more bit to signal whether zero-conf channels are fully operational or only push-only. The original purpose of his idea was meant for instances when there is a trusted exchange, such as trading fiat for sats using an ATM, where only the push amount is spendable and receiving more is disabled. However, since then, some implementations have made zero-conf channels completely operational, which Martin is not against but would like to differentiate between the two cases.</p>
