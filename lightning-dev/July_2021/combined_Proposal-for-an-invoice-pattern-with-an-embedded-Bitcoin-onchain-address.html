        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new Lightning Network (LN) invoice pattern has been proposed that includes a Bitcoin address for onchain transfer as backup. The proposal aims to have an app wallet that works transparently on-chain and/or LN depending on the situation. A BTC address embedded in a Lightning URI is provided as an example of this feature, which could be useful in case of payment failure. The email suggests checking bolt 11 on GitHub for more detail and provides relevant snippets from there. The motivation behind the proposal is to avoid confusion for non-expert users caused by exceptions such as lack of liquidity on specific routes. The author of the email uses Phoenix daily and experienced payment failure while trying to pay a friend. After several attempts, they managed to transfer to Breeze and then from there finally able to transfer to the final destination. The author proposes that if an embedded Bitcoin address would have been present on the invoice that the friend sent, it would have provided an immediate on-chain backup alternative. This would be useful especially when rates are low.The email includes an example format for the proposed invoice pattern and suggests embedding a Bitcoin address on the invoice so that if a payment fails, the wallet could simply ask: "Couldn't send via LN, do you want to send onchain at XPTO rate?" The proposal already exists in today's invoices with a mechanism called fallback address, but the main difference seems to be that the fallback address is not a human readable part of the invoice string but encoded with the other data in the bech32 part of the invoice. The email provides links to John Carvalho's website and social media accounts for those interested in learning more.</p>
