    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread is discussing a method to get around the restriction of CSV by signing an Eltoo "trampoline". Essentially, the idea is to begin a burst session at pk1:N under pk2 but always include a third branch to go to any pk1:N+1. This allows for 32 bits worth of updates and then forward to a new contract by paying 1x extra transaction. By always using this method every update, there would essentially be 64 bits of sequence space. However, doing layers like this adds a bunch of CSV layers, so it increases resolution time linearly.To mitigate this, the suggestion is to do a "semitrusted burst mode" with a counterparty. Party A requests to Party B to initiate burst mode where A and B move to sequence M+1 where state M+1 passes through to a 2 step Eltoo update. This burst now has 32 bits of sequences to blow through. B or A then indicates to the other party to terminate the burst at "internal state number" Q. Then B and A sign M+2 where M+2 reflects the last state at internal state number Q. One benefit of this protocol is that top-level state numbers do not reflect the number of payments strongly as they're more akin to how many burst mode payments were done, which has a benefit for privacy. The semi-trusted nature of this is that if a malicious peer induces you into starting this, you double your funds lockup time. There are some mitigations suggested such as only entering burst mode with long-lived peers, only entering burst mode when initiator has more funds in the channel than you (or has some ratio) which imposes an opportunity cost for attacking, and only allowing a certain percentage of liquidity to be moved during a burst.</p>
