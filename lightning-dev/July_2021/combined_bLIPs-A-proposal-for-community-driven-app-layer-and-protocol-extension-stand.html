        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>There has been a discussion regarding the integration of layer 2 and layer 3 protocols, such as BOLT, RGB, and Volts, into the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) system. Luke Dashjr suggests revising the BIP process and adding editors to support these new additions. He also mentions that a specific range, BIP 2xx, was designated for Lightning in the past, and similar organization methods can be implemented for other protocols. Kalle Alm proposes using "L###" for Lightning sub-namespaces if needed.Michael Folkson suggests the addition of a third BIP editor to specifically handle Lightning-related BIPs. However, he expresses doubt about merging BOLTs into BIPs, drawing a comparison to the expansion of alphabet soups in legislative and regulatory processes. Nathanael argues that improvements in Lightning ultimately benefit Bitcoin as a whole, likening BIPs to the RFCs of the internet.The discussion highlights the consideration of various layer 2 and potentially layer 3 protocols, and whether it is logical to merge them into the BIPs system. It is suggested that addressing all improvements, including Lightning BIPs, simultaneously makes sense. The proposal of a third BIP editor focused on Lightning is well-received, while the possibility of integrating BOLTs into BIPs is met with skepticism. The ultimate impact of Lightning improvements on the Bitcoin network is also discussed, with BIPs being compared to the RFCs of the internet.</p>
