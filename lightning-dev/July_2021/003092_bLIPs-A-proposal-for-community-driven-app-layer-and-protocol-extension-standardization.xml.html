    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network community is considering the need for a process to manage features and best practices that arise outside of the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) process. To address this, an idea was proposed to add a BIP-style process on top of the BOLTs called bLIPs or SPARKs. The bLIP process would allow app layer best practices to be succinctly described and organized, especially those that require coordination. This process would be a descriptive home for optional standards and proposals while BOLTs remain prescriptive measures that specify base functionality required for a routing node.Ryan Gentry recently proposed a new process for standardizing the Lightning Network protocol on the Lightning-dev mailing list. The proposal suggests creating a new type of Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal called bLIPs (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposals) that would focus specifically on standardization efforts. To ensure a community-driven approach, developers from various implementations and from the broader app layer ecosystem would volunteer to be listed as editors for these bLIPs. This is similar to the current role of editors in the BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).As the Lightning Network continues to grow, the need for standardization becomes increasingly important. Bitrefill recently launched Thor Turbo to make it easier for users to get started with the Lightning Network. Additionally, there have been previous discussions on the Lightning-dev mailing list about the importance of standardization efforts, such as the SPARK initiative (Standardization of Protocols at the Request of the Kommunity). Ryan Gentry's proposal includes a link to the initial draft of the first bLIP, which outlines a process for standardizing the network's messaging format.Overall, Ryan Gentry's proposal aims to improve the usability and interoperability of the Lightning Network by providing a community-driven approach to standardization through the bLIP process. This process would complement the existing BOLT process without affecting it. Potential bLIP ideas include lnurl variants, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, and remote node connection standards.</p>
