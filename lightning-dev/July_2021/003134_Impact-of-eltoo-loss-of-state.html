    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list was about what would happen if a node has data but the peer returned an incorrect state. Christian Decker proposed two options that don't touch the blockchain: 1) do nothing and keep the incentive to keep up-to-date backups, and 2) use the peer-storage idea which is the encrypted-blob idea that Rusty has been proposing for a while now. Anthony Towns raised some issues with eltoo channels and provided suggestions to fix them, such as nodes sharing state on reconnection, negotiating mutual/cooperative close, setting channel state index based on real-time, and accepting the loss of connectivity to a channel partner. It was also suggested to limit the total value of inbound PTLCs for forwarding that one is willing to accept at any one time. Layered commitments were also discussed in relation to channel factories.</p>
