    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Jeremy raised concerns over the usage of Eltoo and absolute lock time simultaneously. He pointed out that it is not possible to use Eltoo in such a case due to overloading of the CLTV clause. Jeremy suggested the use of per-input locktimes to address the issue. This would allow satisfying both concerns but disallow using a relative locktime and an absolute locktime for the same input. To tackle this, a new CSV type, 'eltoo sequences' could be defined. However, this technique cannot be used with a sequence tag. Therefore, adding a per-input absolute locktime to the annex was suggested as a better alternative. This approach could also be used to add a commitment to an historical block hash to disambiguate which branch of a chain split or reorg a transaction is valid for.</p>
