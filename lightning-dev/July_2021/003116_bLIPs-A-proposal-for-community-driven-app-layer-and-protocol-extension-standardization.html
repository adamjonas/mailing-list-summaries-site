    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Antoine Riard expressed his personal concern that it would be better if a new specification process doesn't completely share the same communication infrastructure as BOLTs, like avoiding having them in the same repository. Additionally, there is an issue with keeping both BOLTs and BLIPs in the same repository; there's no easy way for contributors to subscribe to only a subset of issues and PRs. For instance, if someone is only interested in BOLTs and clicks the GitHub Watch Repository button, they'll receive notifications for issues and PRs about BLIPs that they're not interested in, and vice versa. If it's still desirable to keep BOLTs and BLIPs in the same source tree, one approach might be the monotree approach that originated with the Linux kernel project and which the Bitcoin Core project began experimenting with about a year ago to moderate success.</p>
