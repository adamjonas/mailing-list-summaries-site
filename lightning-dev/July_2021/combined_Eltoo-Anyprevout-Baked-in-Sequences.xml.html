        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a series of email conversations and online discussions, Bitcoin developers Jeremy, AJ, and Anthony Towns discuss the use of relative locktime and absolute locktime for the same input in Bitcoin transactions. While some argue that disallowing it would be suboptimal, others suggest that using nSequence for a per-input absolute locktime could prevent reusing the same input's nSequence for a per-input relative locktime. One possible use case mentioned is cut-through of PTLC refunds when the timeout expires after the channel settlement delay has passed. The developers also discuss the concept of sequence tagged keys and sequencing restrictions, with Towns suggesting that sequencing restrictions should be obvious from some simple combination of nlocktime/nsequence/annex so that one doesn't have to evaluate scripts/signatures to determine if a transaction is final. Jeremy argues that only one bit of information should be returned from script evaluation, specifically whether the transaction is invalid or not, and that all other relevant information should be easily parsed from the transaction itself. However, he notes that the current system does not have this property and provides an example of a transaction that fails due to the "top stack item is greater than the transaction input sequence" rule. The author of a Github pull request suggests several options to better serve the eltoo use case, including defining a new CSV type or using a sequenced signature. They also suggest adding a per-input absolute locktime to the annex as a better alternative. In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Jeremy raises concerns over the usage of Eltoo and absolute lock time simultaneously due to overloading of the CLTV clause. He suggests the use of per-input locktimes to address the issue and adds that a new CSV type, 'eltoo sequences,' could be defined. However, this technique cannot be used with a sequence tag. Therefore, adding a per-input absolute locktime to the annex was suggested as a better alternative. This approach could also be used to add a commitment to a historical block hash to disambiguate which branch of a chain split or reorg a transaction is valid for. The discussion highlights the complexities of Bitcoin transactions and the ongoing efforts to improve them.</p>
