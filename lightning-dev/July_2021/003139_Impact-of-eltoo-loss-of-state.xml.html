    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about storing data with multiple peers using erasure coding to ensure reliable data storage, while limiting the amount of data stored. The objection that forgetting some state cannot be reliably hidden also seems correct. Barrier Escrow is suggested as a possible solution where both parties can provide data before the other withholds it. Both sides agree on a Barrier Escrow and generate temporary points. They exchange asymmetrically encrypted bundles and then decrypt them after exchanging their scalar values. Alice being amnesiac just provides a random vector for the asymmetric encrypted bundle of Bob. Bob can send a bogus bundle to Alice to check if she is amnesiac. However, Barrier Escrow services have to be paid for their service and need Lightning connectivity.</p>
