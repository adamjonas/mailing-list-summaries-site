        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is currently exploring the addition of a Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal (bLIP) process to the existing BOLT process. The proposed bLIP process would provide a place for app layer best practices to be described and organized, especially those that require coordination. Developers from various implementations and the broader app layer ecosystem are encouraged to volunteer as editors for these bLIPs.The Lightning Network's BOLTs and bLIPs were discussed in a recent conversation. While BOLTs must be strictly followed for network interoperability, bLIPs allow for a loosely coupled evolution of the network by providing a descriptive home for optional standards. By having distinct documents for proposals/standards, bLIPs allow each new standard/proposal to be more effectively explained, motivated, versioned, etc.However, there are concerns about adding more fragmentation to the network, which will add maintenance costs and backwards-compatibility issues. Some members suggest rethinking the current process of the BOLTs to make it more accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs rather than creating bLIPs. Laolu Akande proposes using bLIPs as descriptive documents for app layer best practices while reserving BOLTs for prescriptive measures.Despite some concerns, developers have proposed several potential bLIP ideas, including each lnurl variant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote node connection standards, etc. If the community is interested in moving forward with the bLIP process, a branch has already been started describing such a process. There are also concerns about how the bLIP process interacts with the existing BIP system, as well as how the BOLTs interact with the BIP system. Some believe that BOLTs and bLIPs should be BIPs, but others feel that this introduces large scope creep over what was originally a pretty simple proposal. Additionally, there is an issue with keeping both BOLTs and BLIPs in the same repository; there's no easy way for contributors to subscribe to only a subset of issues and PRs.Ultimately, it does not matter where these design documents exist, only that there is a standard format and that LN developers and users feel empowered to create them and share them with the broader ecosystem. Some members suggest using dynamic commitments as a possible solution, which could make a lot of sense to be well-designed and well-supported by every implementation. Another orthogonal point to consider is the existence of already higher-layer protocol specifications such as the dlcspecs.The Lightning Network community seeks to promote more loosely coupled evolution of the network as bLIPs and BOLTs continue to evolve and change. However, it is important to balance this with maintaining standardization and avoiding fragmentation. The community is actively discussing the best approach to achieve these goals while ensuring the usability and interoperability of the Lightning Network.</p>
