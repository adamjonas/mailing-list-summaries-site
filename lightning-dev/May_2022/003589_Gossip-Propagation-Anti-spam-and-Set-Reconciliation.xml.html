    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo and Rusty Russell discuss the issue of rate-limits in Bitcoin. While Matt agrees that there should be some rough consensus, he argues that rate-limits are locally enforced and cannot be made the same globally. This means that there will always be races and updates that are rejected by some peers while accepted by others, regardless of rate-limit guidelines. Rusty, on the other hand, believes that making rate-limits the same can severely limit the set divergence to race conditions.However, Matt points out that there will always be a line drawn when an update happens right on the line, meaning half of the network will accept the update and half won't. They then discuss the possibility of doing sketches based on "the things that I received since the last sync, ie all the gossip updates from the last hour" versus doing sketches based on "the things I have, ie my full gossip store". Rusty suggests a solution to the problem of each change being two deltas (one remove, one add) with Alex's idea of "include even the expired entries" then "regenerate every N blocks".</p>
