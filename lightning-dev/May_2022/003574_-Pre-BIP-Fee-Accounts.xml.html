    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the author discusses the correct timestamping service model that should be followed by OTS. They suggest that if OTS does not follow their proposed model, it may be considered provably incorrect or unreliable. The author suggests that there are different types of unreliability issues that arise when not conforming to their proposed model, including linearizability. The author also questions whether there is any formal proof of what guarantees OTS provides against which threat model, and suggests that a formal model of OTS would be necessary to produce such proof.</p>
