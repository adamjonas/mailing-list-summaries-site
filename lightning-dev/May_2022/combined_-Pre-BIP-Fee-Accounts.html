        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed an alternative to Bitcoin's current fee-paying system, suggesting an account system as an "extension block." The proposed design introduces a "fee account" output type that can receive deposits stored in a separate UTXO database. Transactions would be committed in an extension block merkle tree, potentially improving scalability and efficiency in the bitcoin network. Rubin suggests modifications to improve privacy, such as implementing something like Tornado.cash and allowing trustless mixing via miners or individuals.In an email conversation between Bitcoin developers, the term "necromancing" was discussed as a possible attack vector in Bitcoin's transaction validation process. The debate over the definition of "pinning attacks" was also discussed, with Peter Todd asserting that pinning is formally defined as sequences of transactions that prevent progress, while Jeremy Rubin argued that sponsored transactions can enable progress even if they are not a preferred interleaving. The conversation also turned to the design of fee accounts.Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed an account system in Bitcoin as an "extension block" to improve the fee-paying semantics in Bitcoin. The proposal involves defining a special output type called a "fee account" that can sign two types of transactions: one to add a fee amount to a transaction and another to withdraw an amount and fee to a designated address. This design could be modified to improve privacy by implementing something like Tornado.cash, and it could work well with Lightning channels.Other proposals discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list include sponsor transactions or fee accounts to simplify the computation of an effective feerate for a transaction and a new sighash flag named SIGHASH_EXTERNAL. Additionally, the article discusses the importance of correctly timestamping transactions in a blockchain network. It highlights a debate among members regarding the validity of out-of-date transactions, with one member arguing that if it has been signed and broadcasted previously, it cannot be considered outdated.The author proposes a model for timestamping services by OTS, stating that failure to follow this model could render the system unreliable. The article outlines various reliability issues that may arise due to non-compliance with the proposed model, including linearizability. Additionally, the author raises concerns about the lack of formal proof regarding the guarantees provided by OTS against different threat models, suggesting that a formal model would be necessary for producing such evidence.Finally, the conversation between Jeremy Rubin and Peter Todd on the bitcoin devs mailing list highlighted the importance of having a proper specification for protocols like Open Time Stamps (OTS) and the need for clarity in technical discussions to avoid confusion among readers.</p>
