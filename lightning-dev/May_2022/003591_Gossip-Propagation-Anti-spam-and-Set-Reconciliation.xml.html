    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Rusty Russell and Matt Corallo discuss the issue of rate-limits being a locally-enforced thing that cannot be made global due to potential race conditions. Rusty proposes a solution where updates contain a block number and only those updates that meet the block height requirement are propagated. However, this proposal requires a gossip "hard fork" and would only work for taproot channels. In contrast, Matt suggests doing sketches based on "the things that I received since the last sync, ie all the gossip updates from the last hour" rather than doing sketches based on "the things I have, ie my full gossip store". Rusty expresses concern about the need for state in the former approach but acknowledges that it may make the protocol more efficient.</p>
