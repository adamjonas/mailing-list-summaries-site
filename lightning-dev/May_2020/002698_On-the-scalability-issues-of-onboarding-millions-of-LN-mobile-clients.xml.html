    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Keagan McClelland and others have pointed out that the RPC interface in Bitcoin Core is not ideal as it exposes functionality that is not necessary. Additionally, there seems to be a demand for something in between a peer interface and an owner interface that would allow for low-cost ways to serve peer services without giving full administrative access to the node. One idea proposed is to have three ports for a full node: the consensus bitcoin protocol, a wallet services protocol, and a control interface. The wallet services protocol would add additional functionality such as bloom filtering, compact block filters, and output and address indexes for Electrum-like support. The control interface would be the existing JSON-RPC interface without all wallet-related methods. By using separate ports, various middleware could be added to support different authentication and transports.</p>
