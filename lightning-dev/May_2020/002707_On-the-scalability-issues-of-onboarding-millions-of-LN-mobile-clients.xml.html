    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The idea of using privately-owned servers as a solution against future problems in LN + SPV nodes has been discussed frequently. It is believed that private full nodes serving headers to a few weak devices can be a good solution. The author believes that it should be a top priority to make the user experience of connecting mobile LN clients to home full nodes easier. This would prevent centralised services from improving much on that step, especially if the user already runs a full node at home. The author requests a brief description of how this user experience currently looks and what blockers exist if it is not as seamless as it could be. The University of Edinburgh confirms that it is a charitable body registered in Scotland with registration number SC005336.</p>
