    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of the bitcoin-dev community, Keagan McClelland, expressed the importance of making it easy to connect a mobile Lightning Network (LN) client to a home full node to prevent centralized services from gaining an advantage. In response, Christopher Allen shared information about an emerging approach called QuickConnect, which allows for secure connection via Tor v3 from a remote device to a personal full node. QuickConnect is currently offered by various full node tools and hardware, including BitcoinStandup, BTCPayServer, Nodl, MyNode, and RaspiBlitz. The technology is used by FullyNoded and FullyNoded2 as well as some experimental apps. However, Allen acknowledges that QuickConnect needs another major iteration and welcomes contributions for the next version. Interested parties can share their thoughts on the matter through the BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup GitHub page.</p>
