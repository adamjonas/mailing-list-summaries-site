    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>As per the conversation between Subhra and Rene Pickhardt, if suppose A and B have a channel with 4 tokens and 6 tokens respectively, and A offers an HTLC of 2 tokens which B accepts, then both A and B have negotiated the HTLC output in the most recent commitment transaction. If A becomes unresponsive and B has to force close the channel, then a commitment transaction with three UTXOs will hit the chain. One UTXO with 2 tokens spendable by A, another one with 6 tokens spendable by B and the received HTLC output with 2 tokens. In such a case, there are two different conditions to spend the output. Firstly, before the timelock of the HTLC has passed, B can spend the output if B knows his to_local HTLC secret AND the preimage. Secondly, after the timelock, A can spend the output if A knows the to_remote HTLC secret. The mechanism with HTLCs can be read upon in BOLT 2 and the scripts can be seen in BOLT 3. A less technical summary that is more focused on explaining the concepts is currently being developed in the routing chapter of mastering the lightning network.</p>
