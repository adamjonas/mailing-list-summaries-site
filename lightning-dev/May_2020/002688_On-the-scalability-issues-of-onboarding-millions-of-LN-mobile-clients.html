    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the implementation of BIP 157, a protocol that would improve privacy for light clients. However, some individuals argue that implementing this protocol in Core could lead to scalability issues and a potential DDoS on the fullnode network if a large number of BIP157 clients arise. Others suggest that watchtowers provide light-client services instead. John Newbery argues that the choice isn't between people using light clients or not but rather between offering them a light client technology that is better or worse for privacy and scalability. He also highlights the benefits of BIP 157, including its unique-for-block feature, which allows clients to download from multiple sources and better privacy. He clarifies that serving filters is an optional, off-by-default feature and no one is being forced to do anything.</p>
