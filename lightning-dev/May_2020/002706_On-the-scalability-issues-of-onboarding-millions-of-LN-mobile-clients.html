    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer suggests that economic weight of nodes should be considered when evaluating miner consensus-hijack success. They also hope that Lightning replaces centralized custodial services, and argue that if most Lightning clients are SPV, the distribution of economic weight would be different. However, they acknowledge the possibility of custodial services arising for Lightning. The idea of forks detection and fallback to backup nodes for SPV is also proposed, but the issue of incentivizing publicly-facing backup servers is raised due to the tendency towards monopoly in a free market. The writer concludes by suggesting that privately-owned servers may be a better alternative.</p>
