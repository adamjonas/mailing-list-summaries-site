    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the limitations of the RPC interface in Bitcoin Core and other interfaces when serving peer services to people with limited authority. The RPC interface exposes a lot of functionality that introduces risks and is not efficient for reading full raw blocks with JSON. There are many use cases where low-cost ways to serve peer services to people with explicit permission are necessary without giving full administrative access to the node. The solution proposed is to have light clients choose their full node tethers explicitly, limiting exposure and externalizing costs without risking consensus capture by economically weighty institutions. However, there seems to be a demand for something "in between" a peer interface and an owner interface, which can limit exposure while still providing necessary services. The email suggests that more experienced individuals should weigh in on whether this belongs in core or not.</p>
