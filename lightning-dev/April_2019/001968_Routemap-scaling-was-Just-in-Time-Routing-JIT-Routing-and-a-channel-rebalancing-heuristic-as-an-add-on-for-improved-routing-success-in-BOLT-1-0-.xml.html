    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is proposing a change to the Lightning Network and discussing the potential dangers of using "buckets" or subsections to organize gossip for efficiency. They explain how this method can lead to targeted attacks and politically-motivated disruptions. The writer suggests that no node should reveal the extent of its knowledge of the network to avoid becoming a target for attack, and that nodes should delegate to other nodes that may have better information instead of admitting ignorance. In contrast to the proposal put forth by the recipient of the message, the writer suggests using a distance measurement to map the network onto a circle and committing to storing an arc of that circle, without revealing the size of the arc. This method would make it more difficult to disrupt the network through targeted attacks.</p>
