    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email explains the state of construction of channel factories and suggests that it is safest to close a factory if an update attempt does not end up in a fully signed transaction. The proposed DMC factory has a lifetime defined by the number of blocks at creation, and if a stale factory exists, the time to close the factory remains l_f-k. However, this is a big trade-off as the bigger l_f is, the more time one can potentially use the factory, but the more time one has to wait before being able to keep using its money. Therefore, the Lightning Factory is proposed as a solution where channels have constant time to close themselves, and the lifetime is potentially unlimited, and it is not even defined as it isn't required by protocol. This idea is extended to factories.To account for the multiple amounts of nested frauds possible in an attempt to close the so-called Lightning Factory, one would require a protocol that stores off-chain n! transactions (being n the amount of users in the factory). Therefore, the biggest element of discussion lies in considering other signature schemes that allow for *NON*-interactive aggregation of messages. In such a way, instead of requiring n! transactions, one could have just O(n) fragments of a transaction, that can be aggregated non-interactively depending on the particular nested fraud attempts. Another motivation for such schemes is the aggregation of independent transactions in Blocks, which has already been proposed. Current literature suggests BGLS as probably the best option to consider, but virtually any non-interactive aggregation scheme should work (even one based on schnorr signatures, should that even be potentially possible).The email concludes by stating that this discussion must be held in the community if we seriously want to scale Bitcoin since DMC Factories are too dangerous to be used with a big amount of users being part of the Factory, and better approaches can be applied under non-interactive aggregation schemes.</p>
