    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network is considering allowing myopic routing nodes to delegate instead of failing, to increase the anonymity set of full-routemap nodes and provide more graceful degradation of service. Full-routemap nodes could be easily profiled by attackers, making them larger targets for disruption as the network grows. The proposal would require only high uptime from trampoline nodes, rather than completeness of their routing tables, but would still be incentive-compatible with full-routemap nodes earning higher fees. Myopic nodes would allocate most of the fee to a delegatee if it knows the next trampoline, increasing the chance of payment success. This system would protect full-routemap nodes while preventing divisions in the network that could enable targeted attacks.</p>
