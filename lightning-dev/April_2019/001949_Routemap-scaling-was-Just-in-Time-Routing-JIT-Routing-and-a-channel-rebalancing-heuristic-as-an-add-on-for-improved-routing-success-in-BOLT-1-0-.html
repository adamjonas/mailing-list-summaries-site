    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about determining the distance from oneself without knowing the entire network topology, ZmnSCPxj explains that a pruning heuristic could be used to probabilistically prune channels. However, this would still lose determinism and make testing difficult. To make it deterministic with a fixed RNG seed, a node could concatenate its public key with the short-channel-id of the channel, hash the concatenation, then use the hash as the seed of an RNG that gives 1 bit, and prune the channel if the bit is cleared. On the other hand, querying for a certain depth would be possible with the suggested `query ask egonetwork` command, but this would require nodes to keep every channel with depth less than the maximum query amount. For friend-of-friend networks, it might be sufficient to just query a peer to give its own direct public channels, which it needs to remember anyway. However, this would only provide a depth of two if we count depth one as the direct channels.</p>
