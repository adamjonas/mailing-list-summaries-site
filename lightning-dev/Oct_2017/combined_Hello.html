        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new member of the Lightning-dev mailing list recently raised a concern about not receiving any emails since joining the list a week ago. The member, Cezary Dziemian, posted the message on October 8th and noted that there had been no discussion on the list since September 19th. In response, Ricardo Filipe, another member of the list, informed Cezary that there had indeed been no discussions during that period and directed them to the mailing list archive where they could review previous discussions.The Lightning-dev mailing list is managed by the Linux Foundation and serves as a platform for discussions related to the Lightning Network. It appears that there was a lull in activity on the list, leading to the member's concern. To address this, Ricardo Filipe suggested checking the mailing list archive for existing discussions. This archive allows users to review past conversations and stay up to date with the latest information.It is important to note that the member's concern regarding their subscription is not directly addressed in the discussion. However, it is implied that the lack of emails may be attributed to the absence of recent discussions rather than an issue with their subscription. The member also mentioned an unrelated advertisement for virus protection in their message, which may be considered irrelevant to their initial concern.In summary, a member of the Lightning-dev mailing list expressed worry over not receiving any emails since joining the list a week ago. There had been no discussion on the list since September 19th, prompting another member to advise checking the mailing list archive for existing discussions.

While the member's specific concern about their subscription is not directly addressed, it is suggested that the lack of emails may be due to the absence of recent discussions.</p>
