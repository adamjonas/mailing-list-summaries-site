        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Cezary Dziemian, a new member of the Lightning-dev mailing list, expressed concern over not receiving any emails or updates since joining the list a week ago. The post was made on October 8th and there had been no discussion on the list since September 19th. The Lightning-dev mailing list is used for discussions related to the Lightning Network and is hosted by the Linux Foundation. Responding to Cezary's inquiry, Ricardo Filipe informed him that there had been no discussion on the list since September 19th and directed him to the mailing list archive where he could check for existing discussions. The Lightning-dev mailing list has an archive available for users to review previous discussions.It is worth noting that while Cezary's message concerned the lack of emails on the mailing list, it also included an unrelated advertisement for virus protection. However, this advertisement does not seem to be connected to the issue of not receiving emails on the Lightning-dev mailing list.Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list appears to have had no recent discussion, but users can access previous discussions via the mailing list archive. The list is managed by the Linux Foundation and is used for discussions related to the Lightning Network.</p>
