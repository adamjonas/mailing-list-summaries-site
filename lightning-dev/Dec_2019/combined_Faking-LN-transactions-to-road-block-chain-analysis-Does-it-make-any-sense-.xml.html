        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network's mutual closes are spends of 2-of-2 outputs, which can be a "blockage" for some in terms of privacy. ZmnSCPxj suggested modifying the current 2-of-2 closing outputs to make them indistinguishable from 2-of-3 outputs by negotiating a random third public key with a nonexistent private key. This approach requires three public keys in the resulting revealed script rather than two. However, Esteban proposed an alternative solution where a random third public key is negotiated with a non-existent private key during channel opening, which would result in a revealed script with only two public keys.To achieve better privacy, a possible scenario was outlined which includes three steps: channel funding transaction, reasonable delay, and channel closure transaction with amount split (not merged). This could potentially be used to fake LN-like transactions to roadblock analysis. Advantages over using actual LN include no liquidity problem, no data exchange with public nodes, and simplicity. However, this assumes that the use of LN itself is not blacklisted by surveillance companies.The upcoming BIP-Schnorr will allow the use of MuSig, which lets all n-of-n (including Lightning 2-of-2) to hide in the same anonymity set as 1-of-1. Work is also being done on verifiable secret splitting, which would allow k-of-n to hide in the same anonymity set as n-of-n, thus bringing the 2-of-3 users into this as well. This uncertainty will force chain analysis and offchain analysis to start considering fuzzy logic. Additionally, CoinSwapper can mix coins by passing them through the Lightning Network.The conversation also touched on potential security risks, including the possibility of an entropy exhaustion attack on negotiation, which could potentially be prevented. Overall, the discussion raises the question of whether such a strategy would make sense and whether anything is missing from the proposed plan.</p>
