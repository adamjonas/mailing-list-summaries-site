    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the possibility of using Lightning Network (LN) channel closure transactions to block chain analysis software from tracing back transactions. It is suggested that if a compliant exchange address or gambling site address is found during tracing, the software stops. Theoretically, an LN channel closure transaction could serve as an exit gateway from another world and stop chain analysis software from analyzing the chain further. This could potentially be used to fake LN-like transactions to roadblock the analysis. To achieve this, a possible scenario is outlined which includes three steps: channel funding transaction, reasonable delay, and channel closure transaction with amount split (not merged). Advantages over using actual LN include no liquidity problem, no data exchange with public nodes, and simplicity. However, it is noted that this assumes that the use of LN itself is not blacklisted by surveillance companies.Overall, the discussion raises the question of whether such a strategy would make sense and whether anything is missing from the proposed plan.</p>
