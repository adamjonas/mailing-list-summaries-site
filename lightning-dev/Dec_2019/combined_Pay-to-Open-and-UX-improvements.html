        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network's onboarding process could be made smoother by addressing the issue of trust between users and nodes during pay-to-open experiments with Phoenix. The trust relationship appears in two places: the user releases the preimage, then we fund the channel; and the user trusts that we won't double-spend the funding transaction. While there are solutions proposed, they have their limitations and vulnerabilities.David and ZmnSCPxj provide feedback on potential solutions for layer-2 constructions in Bitcoin. They discuss using single-show signatures or enforcing a particular `R` using `OP_CAT`. There is also a proposal to modify Tapscript's `OP_CHECKSIG` and use `OP_CHECKSPLITSIG` instead. These are all interesting and useful for future developments, but caution must be exercised while using them.The conversation thread discusses various topics related to Lightning Network and off-chain protocols in Bitcoin. One proposal suggests modifying Tapscript's `OP_CHECKSIG` to prevent double-spending in off-chain protocols, which has potential for many new use cases and could remove pain points in Lightning. However, there were several issues raised during the discussion, such as difficulty recognizing spent UTXOs on-chain and difficulty using RBF on transactions that spend this kind of UTXO.ZmnSCPxj proposed a construction to ensure atomicity using HTLC-like constructions for pay-to-open in Lightning wallets, while also discussing the possibility of implementing single-show signatures in Bitcoin using `OP_CAT`. The use of `OP_CAT` or `OP_SUBSTRING` to enforce ECDSA nonce reuse is seen as a positive protocol tool for enforcing fairness in layer two protocols. The proposed slashing protocol for a Lightning Network node and watchtower involves locking funds in channel outpoint X and issuing commitment tx N. In addition, there was a discussion about enabling outputs to enforce ECDSA nonce reuse but argued against changing the behavior of OP_CHECKSIG, suggesting that it would likely result in bugs in systems that create and sign transactions.Finally, ZmnSCPxj believes that enabling `OP_CAT` is too powerful and must not be enabled, as it could encourage competing miners to mine an alternate block instead of building on the block made by the Finney attacker. Despite the proposed solutions, caution needs to be exercised while implementing them.</p>
