    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is seeking a way to avoid the need for waiting on confirmations for pre-funding transactions, which can lead to holding incoming HTLCs for a few blocks. They ask if there is a smart construction that would allow them to build safely on unconfirmed transactions or if there is a way for the pay-to-open server to lock some UTXOs in advance to prevent double-spending. The response suggests that unconfirmed transactions are only safe/trustless if they cannot be replaced and that pre-agreed offchain transactions cannot be replaced by requiring agreement from all participants (n-of-n). To achieve this, already-confirmed UTXOs that are 2-of-2 between the author and the client could be pre-prepared. However, it is noted that current cryptographic mechanisms make it unlikely that a technology could be derived which avoids the need for confirmation before opening channels.</p>
