    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of OP_CAT or OP_SUBSTRING to enforce ECDSA nonce reuse is seen as a positive by the writer. They believe it to be a powerful protocol tool for enforcing fairness in layer two protocols without introducing additional complexity at the consensus layer, making it an advantageous construction in Bitcoin. In response to a suggestion made by David, ZmnSCPxj provides feedback and a construction using OP_CAT to enforce RBF (Replace-by-Fee) signaling, which increases the assurability of the construction and makes any output that is double-spent directly revocable in favor of the miners. However, they also caution that the use of OP_CAT is a dangerous opcode that allows for such powerful constructions. In another email, ZmnSCPxj suggests a way to enforce single-show signatures in Bitcoin using OP_CAT to ensure a particular R is used, which would feed s only on the witness stack. The writer expresses interest in diving into this solution further as it could be very useful for many layer-2 constructions.</p>
