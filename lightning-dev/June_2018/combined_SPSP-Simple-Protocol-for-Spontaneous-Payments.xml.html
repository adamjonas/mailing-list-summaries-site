        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning network currently requires an invoice from the receiver to send a payment. However, a proposal has been made to enable spontaneous payments within the network. The proposed solution involves routing the payment directly to the recipient's Lightning node using a special form of encrypted routing message. This includes a preimage and potentially other data such as a signed description. If the recipient's node recognizes this format, it can use the preimage to complete or cancel the transaction. This new protocol offers several advantages over the existing "payment to self" method. It simplifies routing by eliminating the need for a second half of the route. Additionally, it allows for a small message to be included with the payment. The proposal has been outlined in a GitHub issue and a "brain storm" wiki on the Request for Comments repository. Because the routing data is encrypted, none of the intermediate nodes can steal funds. Overall, this new protocol could make spontaneous payments much easier and more secure within the Lightning network. It provides a streamlined alternative to the current invoice-based system and offers greater flexibility for users who want to send gifts or other non-invoice-related payments.</p>
