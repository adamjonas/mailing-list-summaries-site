    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author proposed a new system that uses Lightning for decentralized identity. The proposed feature would allow any node to be queried for a mapping and provide an answer along with fulfilling a Lightning payment request. The idea is that nobody would pay for mappings unless they are important, so less popular options will not get paid or can be disregarded. Longer paths or more queries would cost the claimant more and it would cost for each query of the mapping. By paying 1 satoshi per query for decentralized, trusted hosting of data mappings seems fair. The database could also be shared among nodes for a price where a Lightning node can offer to store data per hour and the person who wants redundancy can pay a lightning invoice and provide the data. Lastly, in the future, die-hard fans and companies with Bitcoin to burn for advertising could submit queries like "What's the best place to get a burger in San Francisco," and only those willing to pay would have their opinion heard.</p>
