        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list is a forum for discussing various topics related to Lightning Network technology. In one discussion, Praveen Baratam asked if it is possible for Second Level Protocols like the Lightning Network to be patented by their authors/inventors. Tim Blokdijk replied that these inventions cannot be patented in the EU because mathematical methods and computer programs are excluded from patents. Meanwhile, Oleg Sadov suggested using SDN technologies such as OpenFlow for managing network configurations.Another topic discussed on the mailing list was raised by Joseph Hoane, who expressed concerns about the difficulty in choosing efficient intermediate receivers while using the Lightning Network due to the lack of routing tables. ZmnSCPxj replied that the payer uses their own view of the entire network to create a route, eliminating the need for intermediate nodes to maintain routing tables. Each channel in the view includes a reference to the UTXO backing it, and a signature matching the 2-of-2 multisig is required to prove the existence of these channels.ZmnSCPxj also mentioned that the mesh network routing problem in general can be solved by self-addressing packets or offering a forwarding fee, but this reveals the destination of the payment, which is why Lightning went with onion routing. Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for discussing issues related to Lightning Network technology, including its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
