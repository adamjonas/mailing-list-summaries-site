        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The patent system is designed to give the inventor a state-enforced monopoly on their invention in exchange for completely revealing the design of the invention. The concept of 'prior art' exists, where if the item being patented is already known among practitioners, then there is no need for the state to grant a monopoly. Any evidence that the design of the invention is known is considered prior art, including publications made by the inventor themselves. There is also a grace period where an inventor may publish the design and file for a patent afterward, but this grace period is not unlimited, and the de facto global state government, the USA, provides a grace period of 1 year only. For Lightning Network, since the current Lightning design is publicly available and continuously published in the lightning-rfc, and based on the prior-art Poon-Dryja paper, and neither Poon nor Dryja have applied for patents of the Lightning design within a year of publication of the Poon-Dryja paper, the state will not bother to grant a patent to the inventors of Lightning. It should be noted, however, that agents operating patent systems are known to run on cognitive substrates that are highly amenable to external corrupting influences, and thus non-ideal operation may occur in practice.</p>
