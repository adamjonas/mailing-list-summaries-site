        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Praveen Baratam has expressed confusion regarding the possibility of patenting Second Level Protocols, such as Lightning Network. However, it is unlikely that these protocols can be patented in the EU, as mathematical methods and computer programs are excluded from being patented. The concept of "prior art" applies to items already known among practitioners, thus there is no need for a state monopoly on them. Any evidence that the invention's design is known is considered prior art, including publications made by the inventor. The grace period allows an inventor to publish the design of an invention and then file for a patent afterward, however, it is not unlimited.It is important to note that the information was shared on the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is a platform for discussing development related to the Lightning Network. The current Lightning design is publicly designed and continuously published in the lightning-rfc, based on the prior-art Poon-Dryja paper. Neither Poon nor Dryja have applied for patents of the Lightning design within a year of publication of the Poon-Dryja paper. Therefore, the state will not grant a patent to the inventors of Lightning. However, it should be noted that patent systems may not operate ideally due to external corrupting influences.</p>
