    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj proposed an alternative idea to the "server-client database" concept. The idea involves a special node type called an "advertiser node" that allows advertisers to pay to set mappings and audiences to pay for access to those mappings through a "write" and "read" interface respectively. Additionally, there is a "proof" interface that enables anyone to check how much the advertiser node owns in its channels; if the advertiser lies, it could potentially lose some of its funds. If an advertiser node has a significant amount of funds, it has likely earned those funds from many advertisers paying to set mappings and audiences paying to access them. However, this system would be strongly centralizing and not recommended. ZmnSCPxj replied to Tyler's proposal of adding a feature to Lightning where any given node can be queried for a mapping, such as giving an IP address for Google.com, and the node provides an answer along with fulfilling a Lightning payment request the client provides. ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about the idea, such as attackers inventing a target audience that might not exist and advertisers needing proof that their advertisement did indeed reach a target audience before paying out. Tyler's proposal also suggests sharing the database among nodes for a price, where a Lightning node can offer to store data per hour, and the person who wishes for redundancy can pay a Lightning invoice and provide the data. This data wouldn't have to be encrypted or private since it can be publicly queried. Tyler believes that this proposal would be a good spare functionality used for rebalancing channels and add some utility. In the future, queries like "What's the best place to get a burger in San Francisco" could be submitted, and only those willing to pay for their opinion to be heard would be able to access it.</p>
