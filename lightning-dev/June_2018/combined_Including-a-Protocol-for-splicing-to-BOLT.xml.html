        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developer community is currently working on several features to improve the user experience of the network. One of the most requested features is spontaneous payments, which could be achieved through the generation of a preimage and hash included in the sphinx message to the payee node. The developers are also prioritizing splicing, which will allow users to blend on-chain and off-chain funds seamlessly, displaying one balance for all use cases. A proposal for splicing should include a generic message for both splice in/out, fully async splice in/out, and pre-announcement gossip messages. Multipath routing was implemented as a hack due to the lack of splicing, but Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP) is a priority that may provide a solution. However, AMP is considered a "nasty compromise" with current limitations, and the upcoming Schnorr-Eltoonicorn update may provide a better solution that allows both splicing and AMP. The implementation of these features requires technical knowledge of Bitcoin and specific implementation details, but promising progress has been made towards formalizing the protocols.In addition to these discussions, members of the Lightning-dev community are debating the technical implementation of a splicing proposal. It is suggested that a sort of "scheduler" for splicing can allow implementations to greatly batch all their operations. However, Splice-in should be limited if it has not been buried deeply in the chain yet to limit the number of parallel updates. There are also discussions about reopening old nodes, which should appear as a normal close followed by a normal open from the point of view of old nodes.The context also touches on the importance of proof-of-payment in a system without intermediaries. Currently, they only have a "proof that someone paid" rather than a proper proof-of-payment. The conversation discusses the difficulties of extending the gossip protocol for Lightning Network and suggests that the priority should be given to AMP, which retains proper Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP), and with AMP, the size of channels is less important.Off/onchain bridges are also important as they provide incoming channels, reloading spent channels, and unloading full channels. They form a different layer and move complexity from the Lightning protocol to a different "bridge" layer, making dual-funding channels less necessary.</p>
