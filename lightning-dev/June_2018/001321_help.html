    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list had several discussions on June 23, 2018. The first topic was about the possibility of Second Level Protocols such as Lightning Network being patented. Praveen Baratam asked if it is possible for the authors or inventors of these protocols to get them patented. Tim Blokdijk replied that in the EU, such inventions cannot be patented since mathematical methods and programs for computers are excluded from patents. In another discussion, Joseph Hoane enquired about how to choose efficient intermediate receivers while using the Lightning network, taking into account that no routing tables are part of the architecture. ZmnSCPxj replied that the payer uses their own view of the entire network to create a route, thereby eliminating the need for intermediate nodes to keep routing tables. Additionally, each channel in the view includes a reference to the UTXO backing it and a signature matching the 2-of-2 multisig is required to prove the existence of these channels. Further, Oleg Sadov suggested the use of OpenFlow technology for building software-defined networks (SDN) since it allows the creation of a network configuration managed by the L7 OSI application layer with NW packet routing and transparent transformation for sender/receiver pair. This can be useful for building SDN-enabled Blockchain modelling NW environments.</p>
