    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network has been facing the issue of imposing a minimum 250 sat/ksipa fee rate, which is not accepted by bitcoind nodes. This causes a few issues in C-lightning where they close unilaterally when the counterparty proposes a 250sat/ksipa feerate. Eclair has discovered the same issue and seems to have imposed the same solution as C-lightning. Ucoin has 253 in a constant somewhere. Lnd and lit, on the other hand, have not imposed any minimums and it is unclear whether they have encountered issues with 250 sat/ksipa transactions getting propagated on the Bitcoin-level network. Nodes regulate their minimum fee rates dynamically deepening on the size of their mempools, and even a value of 253 may be too low if a large fee spike occurs. The best current candidate for managing these fee issues seems to be utilizing a permanent op_true output. It should be noted that dynamic minimum relay fees create a problem since many nodes may never relay transactions if the fee is on the low end of the permitted range, and even the default 300 MB mempool setting only fits ~150 blocks worth of transactions.</p>
