        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is facing an issue with imposing a minimum 250 sat/ksipa fee rate that is not accepted by Bitcoind nodes. This has resulted in some issues in C-lightning where they close unilaterally when the counterparty proposes a 250sat/ksipa feerate. Eclair and ucoin have also discovered this issue and imposed the same solution as C-lightning. Lnd and lit have not imposed any minimums, but it is unclear whether they have encountered issues with 250 sat/ksipa transactions getting propagated on the Bitcoin-level network.Nodes regulate their minimum fee rates dynamically depending on the size of their mempools. Even a value of 253 may be too low if a large fee spike occurs. Utilizing a permanent op_true output seems to be the best candidate for managing these fee issues without liberal sighash flags. However, this solution has its own issues. If an attack occurs or nodes are configured to have very small mempools, even a value of 253 may be too low. Nodes should fail the channel if the update_fee is too low for timely processing or unreasonably large. The discussion also touched on the issue of nodes not relaying Bitcoin transactions if fees are too low. The current minimum fee rate of 1000 sat/kbyte is enforced regardless of dynamic blockchain conditions, creating issues with dynamic fee-paying later. The default minimums create a problem if fees are based on having a full week to close a channel, and better dynamic fee systems may require blockchain-level softfork. Meanwhile, the SegWit block size increase can maintain low fees until a better system is developed.Overall, C-lightning, Eclair, and ucoin have imposed a minimum of 253 sat/ksipa feerate to avoid rejection by Bitcoind. Lnd uses vsize internally for all fee estimation and does not impose this minimum. The latest instance of Satoshi's client dynamically regulates its min fee rate, so setting a static fee floor is only a temporary measure that may cease to work at an unknown time. Unilateral closure causes C-lightning to waste on-chain fees sweeping and also incurs the time lock delay.</p>
