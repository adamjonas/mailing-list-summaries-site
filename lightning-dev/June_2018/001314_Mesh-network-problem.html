    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network is a technology that aims to improve the scalability of blockchain networks. However, it has an inherent weakness in that routing tables are not part of its architecture. This creates a challenge for the sender to choose the next recipient in order to efficiently reach the ultimate receiver. Without a routing table, it is unknown how the next receiver is connected to the remote ultimate receiver or to its proximate connections. Even powerful bridge nodes may not know an efficient subsequent path and could send the message on in the most inefficient direction.This raises the question of how to choose an efficient next intermediate receiver without it being a guess or shot in the dark. The mesh network routing problem remains unsolved and no solution has been found yet. Despite this challenge, many still hope for the success of the Lightning Network.</p>
