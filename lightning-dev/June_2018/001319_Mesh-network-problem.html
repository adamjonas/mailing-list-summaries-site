    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of SDN technologies, such as OpenFlow, is being considered for creating network configurations managed at the L7 OSI application layer, which allows for NW packet routing and transparent transformation for sender/receiver pairs. This technology has been used in building SDN-enabled Blockchain modeling environments for R&D projects of students. A question was raised on the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding the weakness of the Lightning Network due to the lack of routing tables in its architecture. The concern was that without a routing table, it would be difficult to efficiently choose the next recipient for a message. It was suggested that even a powerful bridge node may not know the most efficient subsequent path for sending a message. The questioner wondered if any solution to the mesh network routing problem had been found yet.</p>
