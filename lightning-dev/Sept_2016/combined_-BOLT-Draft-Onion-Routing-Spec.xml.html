        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developers have been discussing various aspects of the protocol, including flaws in identifying channels and authentication using public keys. Suggestions were made to use output index of the channel within the transaction and a Schnorr multi-signature generated by four public keys. Payload formatting and key-rotation policies were also discussed.A new feature called Sphinx has been added to enhance security and reduce costs. It adds an extra layer of encryption to Lightning payments, preventing others from knowing the payee and the payment amount. The per-hop payload is used to give instructions to individual hops, i.e., how many coins to forward to the next hop, but currently the end-to-end payload, i.e., the message in the Sphinx protocol, is unused and could be omitted.The Lightning Network developers are proposing a specification for a new onion routing protocol which will allow users to send payments over the network without leaving a trace of the transaction. Nodes would publish two keys, along with a block hash of a block beyond a "safe" re-org distance, and a signature covering the advertisement.The potential ambiguity in transferring funds through multiple channels on different chains using the same identifiers between two nodes is discussed. The solution proposed is making the chain of the target link for each hop along the route explicit.The discussion involves various ideas related to the design of onion routing in the network, such as the ability to identify misbehaving nodes and denounce them, bucketizing sizes to have similar payloads with the same packet size, and the use of timestamps in the packet. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff between the window size of accepted timestamps and a node's storage overhead.Lastly, the ability for intermediate nodes to reply to a packet is discussed, with the proposal to continue blinding the ephemeral key on the return path and have a mechanism to tell the node the total blinding factor along the path so that it can encrypt something in the routing info for the return path.</p>
