    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from September 2016, Christian Decker explained that there is nothing special about splitting a payment as long as the recipient knows the total amount they should be receiving and can delay the release of the secret until all funds are guaranteed. The partial payments are collated using the r-hash, and it's believed that the private key release would work the same way. However, there may be concerns about using the same r-hash across multiple channels as exposure to a colluding intermediary in another channel could lead to funds being pulled before they're sent onward.</p>
