        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been introduced to address the malleability issues of OP_IF and OP_NOTIF in pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) scripts described in BIP141. This is a softfork on top of BIP141 which is enforced as a relay policy by the reference client since its first release. However, this rule does not apply to non-segregated witness scripts. In P2WSH, the argument for OP_IF and OP_NOTIF must be exactly an empty vector or 0x01, otherwise, the script evaluation fails immediately. Users who have used "OP_SIZE OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_IF" in their scripts will need to reconstruct them using "OP_SIZE OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF". Johnson Lau, a user on bitcoin-dev forum, has proposed a restriction for segwit OP_IF argument as policy. He is seeking more people to ACK or NACK the proposal, especially real users of OP_IF. Rusty, another user, mentions that his current scripts use OP_IF and OP_NOTIF only after OP_EQUAL, except for one place where they use OP_EQUAL...OP_EQUAL...OP_ADD OP_IF. However, he states that there is no effect either way on the c-lightning implementation.
