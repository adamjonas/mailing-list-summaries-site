    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns covers various topics related to the Lightning Network protocol. One of the main points they discuss is the optimization of updating multiple HTLCs at once. They also talk about the use of CMD_CLOSE during WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_SIG, but not during WAIT_FOR_HTLC_ACCEPT/WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_COMPLETE, and the possibility of allowing CMD_CLOSE at any time like "Ctrl-C."Errors and declining HTLC updates are also discussed, as well as the potential usefulness of adding a current time field to UPDATE_ADD_HTLC to defuse clock sync problems. The assumption that whoever initiates a channel will fund it is also mentioned.Throughout the conversation, diagrams and code snippets are shared to aid in understanding the various topics being discussed. Another topic that is covered is the different scenarios for channel funding in the Lightning Network. Merchants can register with PayPal or fund the channel themselves using various options such as moving all funds to the other side of their channel, using an exchange account or a 'cold wallet' lightning channel. The initial funding can be kept low, and later increased via a new anchor transaction.There is also discussion of a potential protocol update where multiple HTLCs can be updated at once via a PKT_UPDATE_CHANNEL instead of ADD_HTLC, COMPLETE_HTLC, TIMEOUT_HTLC, etc variants. The PRIO stuff is referred to as klunky, while deadlock situations that may arise due to priority ambiguity are discussed, indicating the need for a "timeout waiting for message -> retry/close channel" in most of the non-NORMAL states.Lastly, there is discussion of a proposed PKT_REBALANCE_VIA_BLOCKCHAIN option which would allow channel rebalancing in case of unbalanced channels.</p>
