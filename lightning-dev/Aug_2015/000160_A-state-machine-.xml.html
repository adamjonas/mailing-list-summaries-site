    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On August 29, 2015, Pierre wrote to Anthony, complimenting his svg. However, he had a question regarding the assumption that whoever initiates a channel will be the one funding it. Anthony replied that although there might be some negotiation before the process, he figures whoever is providing the anchor will indicate they want to proceed by issuing a "cmd_init_with_my_anchor". If you're a merchant, there are three ways to anchor the channel: register with PayPal, anchor with random hub, or anchor and send funds to the other side of your channel. Anthony also mentioned that initial funding could be made low, and then the lightning node can fund the channel. Lastly, he noted that increasing the capacity of the channel would require a new anchor transaction.</p>
