    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the onion routing process for payments where both sides may want to perform onion routing independently to value their privacy. The payment routing requires a separate phase before the locking of transaction funds in payer-payee direction. The email also talks about the fees charged for non-source and source routing which do not vary with time, causing a significant difference in cost vs revenue between a 30s result versus a 4-day result. The author raises a concern regarding the distribution of delayed transaction fines on a mixed source/non-source routing network. They suggest that the height of the fine should be agreed upon before performing a transaction, and an intermediate node can demand a payee-side fine that includes a weighed average of fines it has to pay payer-side on its other links to stay profitable. On the source-routed parts, the fines seem to end up with the endpoints, but there is no persistent business/trust relationship or payment channel between endpoint and intermediate source-routed node, making it difficult to enforce fine payment. Moreover, they discuss that the payee endpoint is not always the bad guy in a delayed payment scenario, and it could be that fund locking from payer to payee stopped somewhere in the middle of the route. If pre-calculated fine amounts are used, an attacker can always make a route that will result in a large loss for some intermediate nodes. The author suggests ignoring source routing for fines and distributing them as if it is only a non-source routing path. However, an attacker can create an arbitrarily long path with source routing, thereby creating arbitrarily large total damage to the network corresponding to arbitrarily large total fines.</p>
