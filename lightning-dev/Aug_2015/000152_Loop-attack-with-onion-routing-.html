    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about Lightning Network protocol, Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns debated whether Dave's public key ID needed to be connected to the HTLC transaction in order for Carol to prove to Bob that she closed the channel. Rusty argued that there was no reason for the two to be connected, since any transaction could be used as an anchor and any keys could be used. Anthony suggested that the HTLC transaction provided Dave's public key ID, which is the only name for Dave that matters. They then discussed the possibility of Dave having a different key for each channel, and the potential risks of constructing fake channel closure transactions.</p>
