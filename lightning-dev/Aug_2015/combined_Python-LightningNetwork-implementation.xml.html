        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jasper Hugunin, a developer at HashPlex, has developed a prototype Lightning node in Python with several features that include micropayment channels supporting unilateral close, basic routing support allowing payment to be routed multiple hops, integration tests, and an MIT License. The Lightning node is an off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin that reduces congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and improves transaction speed. Released tomorrow, it will provide developers with an opportunity to test and improve the technology. Joseph Poon expressed his excitement for the upcoming release.The Lightning repository is shared by Jasper Hugunin and uses a variant of distance-vector routing. However, the current protocol is not a final solution and just a demonstration of potential. The nodes inform their peers about the cost to reach node X and build routing tables using this information. When payment needs to be sent, the node looks up its peers to forward the payment. If the peer does not know the destination or if there are multiple peers involved, the cheapest one is chosen. Rusty agrees with the workability of the routing protocol for bootstrapping purposes and expresses interest in reviewing Jasper's code once he has tested his own protocol state machine.Jasper Hugunin also explains that the version is meant to be a minimal node that supports micropayment channels and basic routing support allowing payment to be routed multiple hops. However, revocation and HTLCs have not yet been implemented, and routing uses an insecure payment forwarding algorithm. Jasper has attempted to split the server, UI, channel protocol, and routing protocol into separate modules so that they can be developed independently. Anyone interested in routing can work on the routing protocol before micro-payment channels are fully secured. Overall, Jasper Hugunin's announcement is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it brings us one step closer to solving the scalability issue and improving the adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream use cases.</p>
