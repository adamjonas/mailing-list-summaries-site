    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread dated August 24, 2015, Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns discussed the scenario of a misbehaving party in a channel closure. They explored two cases: one where Dave misbehaves by not resolving the HTLC on time, and another where Carol pretends Dave was misbehaving when he wasn't. In the first case, Bob can claim funds from Alice, close the channel with Carol, and take the HTLC output on the blockchain. However, in the second case, Bob cannot tell if Dave really sent it to Carol or not, but Alice does not care as she received apology money for the delay. The email also mentioned that the HTLC transaction provides Dave's public key id, which is the only name for Dave that matters.</p>
