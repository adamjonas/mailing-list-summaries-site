    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about adding a fine to be paid by the payee if the R value is delayed. It is suggested that even without cryptographic enforcement, the fine could be enforced by closing the channel if it is not paid. The payee has several choices including acting quickly to avoid paying a fine or revealing R later and receiving less money due to the fine. A small fine would be better than closing the channel unilaterally. In the case of misbehaving nodes at the end of a chain, who do not pay their fines, well-behaved nodes making up the rest of the chain will always pay the fine to keep their link intact. The discussion also includes explicit source routing fees and non-source routing fees. Cryptographically locking fees in by updating the channel every hour with applied fees to balances could be cheaper than paying a 0.1 mBTC blockchain txn fee as long as there are fewer than 10 BTC worth of active transactions on which fines are being paid. The discussion concludes with Anthony Towns' signature.</p>
