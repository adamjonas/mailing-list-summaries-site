    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Christopher Jamthagen, Eric Lombrozo, and Rusty Russell on the Lightning-dev mailing list, they discuss the possibility of stealing money from a hub. The group discusses how to design a deployable system that will allow for the third party to steal the money after the cheater signs and broadcasts their revoked commitment transaction, which is necessary since the txid is not known beforehand. Rusty Russell suggests that outsourcing needs a new sighash op mode or normalized txids for this to work effectively. Lombrozo proposes a solution where the third party would notify him and request a signature when the cheated transaction occurs instead of having his device monitor the network. Once notified, Lombrozo could sign the stealing transaction and take all the money himself.</p>
