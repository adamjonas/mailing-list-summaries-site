    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the Lightning Network and its implementation. Anthony Towns suggests a lightweight initiation of the payment process using QR code or NFC for payment-by-lightning to be added to other protocols such as bittorrent clients. Rusty Russell proposes a scheme requiring a valid unilateral close transaction to prevent upstream closures. Misbehavior cases and resolutions are also discussed. Joseph Poon talks about pending sends between participants in a cartel having shorter HTLCs in transit than outsiders. The discussion also covers source routing, payment channels, and channel commitment transactions.Payment channels for Bitcoin's lightning network are explored, with two possible paths that a user can choose based on time and cost factors. Delaying transactions could lead to losses of TIMEOUT*AMOUNT worth of funds on the B/C or C/D channels, encouraging future transactions to deposit funds on C's side of the A/C channel. Source routing can create arbitrarily large total damage to the network, corresponding to arbitrarily large total fines. The recipient must pay fines at each point, so H not A. The fine may not always be small relative to the blockchain fees, especially if the blockchain fee is zero. The exchange rate is also discussed.Assuming the average developed-nation person has around $10,000 in savings, 2.1 mBTC savings would be equivalent to $10,000 in today's dollars, making $4800/mBTC. As a result, $1 uBTC is equal to $4.80, and 1 satoshi is about 5c, meaning you couldn't charge a fee less than 1% for a $5 coffee, and couldn't spend less than 5c when doing microtransactions. Discussions about source routing and fines in regards to payment channels are also present, with suggestions of adding a fine to be paid from payee-side of a single link to the payer-side of the link if the R value is delayed. Proposed solutions include closing the channel or paying a fine in certain situations.The risk model of onion routing in Bitcoin's Lightning network is discussed, with concerns raised about the graph becoming more diffuse if good transactions take four days and fees are charged for that time period. Colluding participants in the network may cause dishonesty and tie up channels for maximum periods of time, increasing costs for other members. There are also concerns about atomic movement of HTLCs and how to charge appropriate fees for delays. The need for reputation as part of the routing service was suggested along with the idea of having a per-hop max delay. Finally, there was a discussion about collusion between participants and the possible outcomes of such behavior.</p>
