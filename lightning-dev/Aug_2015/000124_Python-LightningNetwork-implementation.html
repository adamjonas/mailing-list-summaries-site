    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jasper Hugunin, a developer at HashPlex has implemented a full prototype Lightning node in Python. The version is meant to be a minimal node which supports Micropayment channels and basic routing support which allows payment to be routed multiple hops. The node can send payment across multiple hops in the network but revocation and HTLCs have not yet been implemented. Routing also uses an insecure payment forwarding algorithm (since HTLCs are missing) and does not handle channels closing. Jasper has attempted to split the server, the UI, the channel protocol, and the routing protocol into separate modules so that they can be developed independently. Anyone interested in routing can work on the routing protocol before micro-payment channels are fully secured. The GitHub issue tracker has more details. The integration tests use MIT License.</p>
