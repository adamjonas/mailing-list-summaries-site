    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the Thunder proposal has discussed how to integrate OP_CLTV and CSV into the channel design to mitigate all malleability problems. Refund transactions that need to be interchanged are no longer necessary, as the refund can be a part of the opening transaction. This eliminates any risk problems and allows for large amounts of funds within the channel. A new version of the channel is agreed upon when both parties release their temporary signatures A2 and B2, with malleability no longer an issue. Sending and receiving payments now consists of three outputs, combining the mechanism for refunds and revocable transactions with the ability of the receiver to claim payments if they know the secret R. However, there are issues with HTLCs not being strictly revocable, which can be resolved using a simple reserve strategy. The implementation of these changes in the current Thunder implementations is trivial, as it involves deleting many methods currently necessary and switching to new scripts. There is a problem with settlement transactions not being time-encumbered, which means one party can claim this payment under any circumstances. It is important to keep track of the amounts the other party is receiving to ensure that his balance does not drop below a certain amount. This rule also serves as an incentive to clear out receiving payments as soon as possible.</p>
