        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the article, the importance of keeping track of the maximum amount of uncleared receiving payments in a channel is discussed. This is to defend against an attack where one party could spend all their money without adhering to agreed-upon rules.The author suggests that Bob can refuse to accept a new channel transaction if Alice's balance would drop below 5 BTC. This serves as an incentive for clearing out receiving payments as soon as possible.The article also mentions the implementation of OP_CSV and OP_CLTV in Bitcoin. OP_CSV is important in avoiding a hack similar to the one described in the article. Furthermore, the article describes a model of implementing OP_CLTV without OP_CSV using a balance reserve. This reserve strategy can be applied for payments in both directions and always specifies which party has to keep track of the amount of uncleared funds.If Alice tries to broadcast an old channel state from t=1, she can only claim the 10 BTC that were part of the initial funding. This is where the balance of Bob comes in. He has to make sure that he always has at least 5 BTC on his side so that Alice cannot claim more than 10 BTC. In case she does try to do so, Bob can broadcast the latest state himself and take all funds.Lastly, the article provides links to related discussion threads and pull requests for further review by those interested.</p>
