        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about Bitcoin's susceptibility to reorg attacks, Anthony Towns suggests that setting up anonymous channels could allow for double-spending with fewer confirmations than would normally be required. The attacker would fund multiple lightning channels and wait for confirmation of their activity before routing payments to anonymous channels. Joseph Poon replies that this is unlikely due to high confirmation times on Lightning. He acknowledges that reorg attacks are known with Bitcoin and suggests that funding channels should have fairly high confirmation times. Once set up, confirmation times do not matter as much because the channels are off-chain.The cost of a doublespend attack over M blocks would be 1.4*25*M bitcoin, and the attacker would need to have >$X funds available in the first place to commit to the double spend. If it costs 1.4*25*M bitcoin to mount a doublespend attack over M blocks, and you can open 2000 channels per block, then that gives X>1.4*25*M,n>X, and d=35/2000 * (1+4) = 7/80, n=6000. This means that the attacker is putting up 525 bitcoin by flooding the blockchain with anchor transactions, sending it to themselves over lightning, then doublespending the original 525 btc at a cost of spending ~505 btc on hashpower. It may be worthwhile, with a 3.8% ROI in ~6 hours, which is 16% a day or about 5e25 % annualised.Increasing the blocksize or lowering the block reward increases the confirmations required. To mitigate the risk of an attack, something like "$d" could be put on one side of the channel, requiring a certain number of confirmations before the transaction is complete.</p>
