    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message thread, Rusty Russell expresses concern about the risk model for Lightning Network's payment channel system. This model assumes that good transactions take four days, which could lead to difficulties in judging where a transaction falls within a 10,000-factor range. Additionally, the model forces intermediate nodes who are well-connected to offload their HTLCs to third-party channel liquidity providers. Onion routing is discussed as a potential solution, but there are concerns about some participants colluding to disclose R faster, thereby biasing channels and increasing costs for some parties. The conversation then turns to per-hop contracts, with the suggestion of a "per hop maxdelay" of 20 seconds. However, there are still questions about how delays will be handled and whether charging fees for the full timeout period is necessary. It is suggested that hubs running at rates assuming the timeout will never get hit may end up losing money in the long run.</p>
