    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Mats Jerratsch and Joseph Poon, Mats asked if he could call a proposed system a Lightning Network Implementation. Joseph responded by expressing his concerns about any system that has an implicit level of trust, especially in regards to long-term systemic risks. The goal of the Lightning Network is to allow users to connect with anyone without risking the counterparty outright stealing or encumbering funds. Joseph believes that if a semi-trusted implementation were to be used, it may encourage the use of systems that let you maliciously encumber HTLC funds in transit and funding on main-net. Joseph suggested testing with the new opcodes using dummy opcodes on testnet instead of encouraging the use of semi-trusted implementations. He also noted that a malleability fix and timestop would be ideal for long-term use. Mats mentioned that both problems can be eliminated with OP_CLTV, which will be implemented soon. Joseph agreed that this would be a Lightning Network implementation if it uses the new opcodes similar to Rusty's construction and expressed appreciation for any implementation that would help with scalability of bitcoin micropayments. He clarified that they both agree that scalability of bitcoin micropayments is important, and he looks forward to continuing to develop these technologies with Mats.</p>
