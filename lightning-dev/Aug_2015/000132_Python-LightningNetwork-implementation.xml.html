    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Jasper Hugunin explains the routing protocol used in a system. He mentions that the current protocol is a variant of distance-vector routing, where nodes inform their peers about the cost to reach a particular node. This information is then used to create a routing table, which helps in forwarding payments to the desired recipient. The process involves looking up the next hop and cost from the ROUTES database. If the selected peer does not know the destination, they have provided false information. In case there are multiple peers, the cheapest one is chosen. However, the current protocol is not a final solution and just a demonstration of potential.The response to Jasper's explanation comes from Rusty, who agrees with the workability of the routing protocol for bootstrapping purposes. He also expresses his interest in reviewing Jasper's code once he has tested his own protocol state machine.</p>
