        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list recently discussed various aspects of the Lightning Network (LN) protocol. The group talked about outsourcing monitoring of LN transactions, detecting cheating in the protocol, and implementing a timestop feature for CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) transactions. They also discussed scalability of outsourcing, storing R values and timeouts, delay on party's ability to spend the HTLC output, and the minimum CSV required for accepting HTLCs.One topic of discussion was outsourcing monitoring of LN transactions. The network is considering hiring miners to check for cheaters in their network, with incentives in the form of fees. However, this requires a new sighash op mode or normalized txids, which makes it not feasible for deployment yet.Another issue that was discussed was the timestop feature for CSV in the context of a Lightning Network transaction. The timestop feature is said to not activate until the CLTV transaction is included in a block, which could allow for a denial-of-service attack. To prevent this, it was suggested that the CLTV transactions include the current block-height immediately when a commitment transaction is signed, so miners can know where to start counting full blocks from as soon as it is broadcast.The group also discussed implementing a tiny advance payment every month to prevent cheating in LN protocol. They also talked about how to handle the stealing transaction when a cheater signs and broadcasts it, as there's no pre-signed stealing transaction for the third party. One solution proposed was to have the third party notify the user and request a signature when it occurs.Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and challenges involved in deploying the Lightning Network protocol. Ensuring security and preventing cheating while maintaining scalability and efficiency are key concerns to be addressed.</p>
