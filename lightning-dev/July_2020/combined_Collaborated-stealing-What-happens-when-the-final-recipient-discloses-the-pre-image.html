        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this scenario, A and E do not have a direct payment channel, so they use the Lightning Network to send funds. E sends the hash of a secret r to A through intermediaries B, C, and D. However, E breaches the protocol by disclosing the secret to partner-in-crime C and does not respond to D. A loses the money as E denies receiving it. The Lightning Network considers possession of the preimage as proof of payment, which is stronger evidence than E claiming to not have received anything. The likelihood of guessing the preimage is practically impossible.If E gives the preimage to someone else instead of claiming the money from D, it would be considered E's problem, and A could take legal action. The possession of the preimage matching the signed payment hash from E is strong evidence of A having paid. The Wormhole attack involves two forwarding nodes in a path coordinating with each other, skipping intermediate forwarding nodes. In the specific case described, one of the nodes performing the attack on a path is the payee itself. As long as A can acquire the preimage, it has proof of payment, and even if E claims that it did not deliberately give the preimage and was hacked by C, C is liable. Good invoices signed by E and indicating who exactly is going to get the service or product are important. The wormhole attack can be fixed by using PTLCs and blinding factors. E learns the total of all blinding factors, knows the final scalar, but does not know the blinding factor delta from C to E and thus cannot give C any information on how to claim the funds. The preimage and invoice that have a signature from E are sufficient to show that E has an obligation to provide a service or product to A.</p>
