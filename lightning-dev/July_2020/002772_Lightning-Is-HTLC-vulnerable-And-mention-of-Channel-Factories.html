    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the email is concerned about potential losses on the Lightning Network due to unconfirmed Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) or competition from conflicting HTLCs. They also ask if denial-of-service attacks could prevent settlement HTLCs from being sent. They have heard of a recent attack technique called "flood and loot" but are not sure if it could be used on the Lightning Network. The author admits they do not fully understand the Lightning Network and asks if channel factories would eliminate their concerns. They are sending this email to the lightning-dev mailing list and requests to be CC'd in any replies since they cannot access the mailing list themselves.</p>
