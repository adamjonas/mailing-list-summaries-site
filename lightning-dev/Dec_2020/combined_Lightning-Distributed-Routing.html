        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>João Valente has proposed a new concept for routing in the Lightning Network called Lightning Dynamic Routing (LDR). This concept aims to improve routing by utilizing information about the distribution of funds in channels. In LDR, each node shares its channel balance information with its neighbors through a routing table, which maps destination addresses to the next hop in the maximum capacity path.ZmnSCPxj provided feedback on LDR, noting that it presents a bigger barrier compared to other solutions because it needs to be running on every node in a payment path. They suggested using fees as a signaling layer, similar to the 'feeadjuster' plugin for C-Lightning, to achieve similar benefits without requiring most payers to upgrade. However, João believes that LDR, which explicitly shares channel balance information, may have a performance edge over 'feeadjuster'.There was also a discussion about implementing an LN overlay network without a spec change. ZmnSCPxj recommended standardizing the overlay network if it is to be implemented. The author agreed with this suggestion and mentioned that nodes would not gain any additional routing traffic by signaling better fees or larger capacity routes.In another conversation between João, Bastien, and ZmnSCPxj, the 'feeadjuster' plugin for C-Lightning was discussed. It adjusts channel fees based on balance and signals whether or not to use a channel based on its capacity. CLBoSS, another C-Lightning plugin, implements similar logic. Concerns were raised about nodes gossiping biased or invalid information to attract more payments or put honest routing nodes out of business. To address this, João proposed changing the way nodes choose the next best hop to diminish the incentive for false signaling.The author of an academic paper on routing in the Lightning Network received feedback suggesting that nodes could cheat by sharing biased or invalid information. The author proposed changing the way nodes choose the next best hop to diminish this incentive and discussed how dishonest nodes could steal routing paths that would otherwise belong to honest nodes.João Valente also introduced a new concept for routing in the Lightning Network. This concept involves nodes sharing information on the distribution of funds in their channels through routing tables. When a new payment is made, a payment probe is forwarded through every node in the path, collecting information along the way. This knowledge can then be used to confidently route LN payments through the discovered path. The author has written a 10-page paper on this concept and is seeking feedback.</p>
