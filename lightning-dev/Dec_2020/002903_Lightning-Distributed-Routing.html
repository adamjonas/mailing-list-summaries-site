    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>João Valente responded to feedback from ZmnSCPxj regarding the Lightning Dynamic Routing (LDR) protocol. ZmnSCPxj had pointed out that LDR presents a bigger barrier than other solutions because it needs to be running on every node in a payment path for it to work, whereas 'feeadjuster' can help the sender even if only one node in the payment path is running it. João mentioned that he was thinking about LDR as an independent protocol with its own specification, which would be implemented by software that runs alongside a spec-compliant Lightning node. He shared his extended version of the paper defining the new specification and early beginnings of the LDR-spec compliant software targeting lnd and bitcoind, which can be accessed through links provided.ZmnSCPxj suggested that using fees as the signaling layer can get something like this partly working for most payers today even if only a small number of nodes run `feeadjuster` or CLBOSS, whereas with LDR, most payers need to upgrade to using the new overlay network to get similar benefits, in which case standardizing it in the specs would be necessary.</p>
