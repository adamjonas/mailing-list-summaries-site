    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between LL and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of proof-of-discrete-log-equivalence was discussed. It was suggested that a ZKCP on payment point+scalar could be used to gate part of the proof. However, ZmnSCPxj pointed out that if a secure conditional payment for the proof existed, it would prove that the proof itself existed and there would be no need to pay for it. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the proof in question. For instance, a pay-for-proof scheme that involves providing an (R,S) for a public key P=p*G where S=s*G may not prove anything until payment is made for the scalar s. Therefore, the adequacy of a mere ZKCP in proving something depends on what needs to be proven.</p>
