    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Joao and ZmnSCPxj, they discuss the `feeadjuster` plugin for C-Lightning and its similarities to LDR in terms of allowing for better routes by signaling channel balance availability. However, LDR goes one step further by sharing channel balance information explicitly. ZmnSCPxj believes that LDR may have a performance edge due to its ability to share more information. They also discuss the implementation of an LN overlay network and how it could work without a spec change. ZmnSCPxj suggests that using fees as a signaling layer can provide similar benefits to LDR without requiring most payers to upgrade to using the new overlay network. This is because existing implementations already try to minimize fees, so signaling a low fee when you have high capacity on a channel does the "right thing" on the network today. In contrast, with LDR, most payers would need to upgrade to using the new overlay network in order to get similar benefits. ZmnSCPxj recommends standardizing the overlay network in the specs if it is to be implemented.</p>
