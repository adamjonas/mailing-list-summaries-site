    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Lloyd Fournier questioned the effectiveness of stake certificates in preventing channel jamming attacks in the Lightning Network. He argued that locking up funds to send a jamming HTLC already imposes a cost on attackers and there is an open question whether these attacks are actually economic. Gleb Naumenko responded that stake certificates allow for better control of flows and can force attackers to distribute jamming across many channels. However, Lloyd pointed out that large holders of Bitcoin could still produce stake certificates galore and lock up channels, making it difficult to prevent such attacks. In response, Gleb suggested the possibility of preventing loop attacks by the sender proving the path is well formed without revealing their identity or other hops. David A. Harding also raised concerns about the feasibility of restricting UTXOs for stake certificates and the potential for attackers to rent access to stake certificates to launch attacks.</p>
