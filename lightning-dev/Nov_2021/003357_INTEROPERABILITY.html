    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about testing the implementation of Lightning Network on boxes and channels before releasing it to the public. Each team should provide boxes and channel liquidity as stake on mainnet for tests to avoid confusion among users. It is recommended that teams manage the analysis of their own implementation, but outsourcing is allowed. The loglines of each box should be collected at one central point to compare interoperability per unix.ts identified by box. The question is where to set a proper cap in time for collections. An outside party could run the central point collector, sponsored or not. ZmnSCPxj suggests that interop bugs can be caught by running nodes that track the master of C-Lightning or by connecting to LND, which is popular on the network. However, some interop bugs are deeper than just direct node-to-node communications, so testing is important before the public release.</p>
