        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Fabrice Drouin proposed removing LND's source code from the lightningnetwork GitHub organization. He argued that having both the implementation and specification of the protocol in the same location had created confusion between the open-source protocol and Lightning Labs. The proposal sparked discussion, with some expressing concern about fragmentation and others agreeing that separation would be useful. Laolu Osuntokun suggested moving the spec to an independent repository owned by the community or creating a new organization called "lightning-specs." The Lightning Network Github organization now has a new repository called "blips" to continue the PR that was initially started in the lightning-rfc repo. The old lightning-rfc repo has been moved over and renamed to "bolts." There were concerns regarding broken links when moving a repository, and Bryan Bishop suggested including a soft note in a README somewhere. Matt added that he believes the Github "move repository" feature already includes auto-redirects for old links, but noted that this information is a few years old and may no longer be accurate. Olaoluwa Osuntokun clarified that Lightning Labs had purposefully created a new GitHub organization to keep LND distinct from any future commercial products/services. The company has architected all paid products to be built on top of LND, rather than within it. A new Github organization called "lightning" has been created, and all the major implementation maintainers have been added as admins. This change was made because the primary grievance was collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol. Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested moving the spec to an independent repo owned by the community, and this idea was well-received. It was proposed to use github.com/lightning/bolts for the new repository. The lightning community resolved the issue during a recent protocol dev meetup.</p>
