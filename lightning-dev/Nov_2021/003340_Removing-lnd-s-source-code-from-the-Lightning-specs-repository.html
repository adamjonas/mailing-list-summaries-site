    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested creating an official logo for the Lightning Network project, stating that the current placeholder logo could be replaced with either an identicon or a symbol specific to the project. ZmnSCPxj then attached an SVG file of a simple logo they had been working on. The thread also mentioned updates to the Lightning Network GitHub organization, including the creation of a new blips repo and the renaming of the lightning-rfc repo to 'bolts'. Additionally, there was a discussion about moving the specification of the protocol to an independent repo owned by the community, potentially using github.com/lightning/bolts as the new location. Overall, the thread seemed to be focused on improving the branding and organization of the Lightning Network project.</p>
