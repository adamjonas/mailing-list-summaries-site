    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The open-source model relies on individuals with skill and/or money to contribute to the project they are using. Those without the necessary skills can contribute hardware, testing reports, and possibly money to support the development of the project. However, the real issue is how to aggregate the will of a group of people without risking centralization. In terms of running boxes with channels on mainnet for implementation release and rc versions, it's recommended that teams manage the analysis of their own implementation. A solution for the central point collector could be run by an outside party, but logs must have sensitive information redacted to avoid targeted attacks and ensure privacy. Automated redaction of changed log messages is also necessary to prevent leaks of sensitive information.</p>
