    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network Github organization now has a new repository called "blips" to continue the PR that was initially started in the lightning-rfc repo. The old lightning-rfc repo has been moved over and renamed to "bolts." The major implementation maintainers have been added as admins, and the Github organization exists. However, there is currently a placeholder logo being used as the org's avatar/image, and Laolu suggests that it may be time to roll out an official logo/avatar. Otherwise, they can switch over to the randomly generated blocks thingy that Github uses when an account/org has no avatar. In addition, there was a discussion about the history of the Github org and how it was created. Initially, Joseph created the lightningnetwork Github organization, and the lightningnetwork/paper repository was added, followed by lightningnetwork/lnd, where the devs worked on an initial implementation before BOLTs existed. Eventually, all developers of current implementations met up in Milan and decided to converge on a single specification, thus adding the BOLTs to the same repo. The primary grievance is collocating an implementation of Lightning with the specification of the protocol, and given that the spec was added last, Laolu suggests moving the spec to an independent repo owned by the community. They could create a new org like "lightning-specs" or use github.com/lightning/bolts, which seems to please everybody.</p>
