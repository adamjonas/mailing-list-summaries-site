    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the composition of delegations and prevouts. It introduces full delegation, partial delegation, and half-delegation, which differ in how one signs for a transaction T. The group considers scriptless multisigs and SSS, which is an alternative to onion encryption that distributes shares to R multisig signers. However, it is noted that if T is signed by S with AnyPrevOut, then T is now arbitrarily rebindable, so they propose stricter definitions. They introduce half-delegation as a solution to prevent anyone other than R from rebinding the transaction. The email further discusses scenarios where APO may or may not work and how half-delegation can be derived from full delegation and a covenant. Lastly, the group briefly mentions chaperone signatures and how they are no longer needed in the design discussion for APO and Delegation proposals and CTV.</p>
