    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new Github organization called lightning has been created and all the major implementation maintainers have been added as admins. A new blips repository has also been created to continue with the PR that was originally started in the lightning-rfc repository. The old lightning-rfc repository has been renamed to "bolts" and moved over. This change was made because the primary grievance was collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol. Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested moving the spec to an independent repo owned by the community, and this idea was well-received. It was proposed to use github.com/lightning/bolts for the new repository. The lightning community resolved the issue during a recent protocol dev meetup.</p>
