        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developers have announced the creation of a new independent repository owned by the community to separate the Lightning protocol implementation code and specification. The old lightning-rfc repo has been moved over and renamed to "bolts". This proposal came after a discussion on collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol. As the spec was added last, it is being moved to an independent repository owned by the community.A new Github org has been set up, and a new blips repo has been created to continue the PR that was originally started in the lightning-rfc repo. The creation of a new Github organization will formalize the set of stakeholders and the general process related to the evolution of Lightning the protocol. A new official logo/avatar for the organization is also being considered.There has been confusion regarding the relationship between the Lightning Network open-source protocol and Lightning Labs, which is one of the companies implementing this protocol. The source code for lnd, an implementation of the protocol by Lightning Labs, is hosted on the same Github repository as the white paper and specifications for the protocol. A recent report referred to lnd as the "reference" implementation for the protocol, prompting a proposal to remove lnd's source code from the current repository and move it to a different location such as lightninglabs' repository to avoid any confusion between Lightning the open-source protocol and the implementation of the protocol by one of its developers.Laolu Osuntokun suggested moving the specification to an independent repository owned by the community to further formalize the set of stakeholders and the general process related to the evolution of Lightning the protocol. However, changing the repository may result in broken links, but it is believed that the Github "move repository" feature makes all old links auto-redirects.</p>
