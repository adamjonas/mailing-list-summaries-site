    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the message is proposing that developers of Lightning Network Node implementations, such as Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs, should not be obligated to devote additional hardware and resources when they have already provided their implementations for free. The author recounts a story from the SegWit wars where both pro and anti-SegWit individuals questioned when "they" were going to implement Lightning. As a programmer themselves, the author realized they could contribute to the implementation of Lightning and started contributing to C-Lightning. The author asks the reader what they can do to advance their goal and mentions that C-Lightning and Eclair developers are already running mainnet nodes tracking respective master branches. They suggest asking the developers directly if there are any particular implementations that the reader is concerned about.</p>
