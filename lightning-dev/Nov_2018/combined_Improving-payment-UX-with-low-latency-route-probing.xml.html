        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network faces a significant challenge of pending payments, which can lead to complaints from users. One possible solution is to disconnect from a node that is taking too long to send a revocation and reconnect immediately to the same node. Another solution involves using probing with short timeout requirements by sending a "blank" probe request before sending the actual payment request along the same route.In a conversation between Laolu, Fabrice, and Pierre, various solutions were discussed, including using HORNET during the set-up phase and each node having a private "fee function." Pierre suggested adding the suggestion of disconnecting from slow nodes to BOLT 2 as a "SHOULD" clause. Fabrice proposed using a "0 satoshi" payment request to check if all nodes on the route are alive and responsive before sending the actual payment, which involves generating a "0 satoshi" payment request along with the real one.Overall, these solutions aim to address pending payments on the Lightning Network and provide faster responses to sending nodes using probing and disconnecting from slow nodes.</p>
