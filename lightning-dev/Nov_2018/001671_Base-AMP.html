    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Johan Tor√•s Halseth and Rusty Russell, the topic of supporting Base AMP is discussed. Johan believes that the invoice will already indicate if a node supports Base AMP, and if there is a reason to not reveal that support for certain invoices, it would simply not be specified in the invoice. This would be opt-in for both sides and not affect existing nodes. Rusty suggests having a flag on BOLT11 and inside the onion as an explicit opt-in for both sides, rather than relying on a partial payment error as a probe for Base AMP. A response from ZmnSCPxj clarifies that Rusty is referring to a probe by an intermediate node, rather than the source node which already knows if the payee supports AMP or not.
