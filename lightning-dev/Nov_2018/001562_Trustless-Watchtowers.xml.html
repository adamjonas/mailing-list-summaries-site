    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is discussing the topic of watchtowers in relation to lnd and Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels. The writer notes that some code related to watchtowers already exists in lnd, but it seems to be limited to data structures and messages without actual logic. They also mention a paper about paying watchtowers by simulating breaches, which would give evidence of liveness and incentivize correct behavior. However, watchtowers would need to keep all encrypted blobs that are keyed to the same partial txid to prevent potential attacks from a counterparty. The email also discusses the compatibility of watchtowers with Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels. Laolu suggests that channels can simply "update" the blob side of a txid-blob entry, but the writer notes that this is unsafe unless the watchtower identifies the user somehow. Identifying the user could potentially leak their privacy to the watchtower, rendering the encrypted blob pointless. The writer asks for clarification on what plans Conner and other lnd developers have for addressing these issues.</p>
