        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is actively discussing potential improvements to the payment flow for lightning in the future. One such proposal put forward by Rusty Russell involves using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages as an experimental/optional feature in v1.1 of the Lightning specification, which is seen as necessary for payment decorrelation, Atomic Multi-Path (AMP), and third-party verifiable proof-of-payment. Russell also suggests that invoices should be able to be paid multiple times by different individuals and payments should be provable in a way that prevents fraud. To address this issue, scriptless scripts are suggested as a possible solution. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj suggests that both 2p-ECDSA and Schnorr contingent payment schemes can effectively encode "I will pay you N satoshi if you give me the private key of the public key P on the secp256k1 curve, before time B," which can be composed with another contingent payment of either 2p-ECDSA or Schnorr.In a channel announcement thread, ZmnSCPxj suggests that it would be possible to have a route with channels alternating between the two schemes. A recent email conversation between Rusty Russell and Jonas Nick delves into different levels of payment on the Lightning Network, such as low AMP, multiple payments with the same hash, and high AMP. Rusty suggests a mechanism for AMP splits and joins, which involves knowing x_i for each input and y_j for each output other than the first and verifying I_i = O_1 + x_i*G and O_j = O_1 + y_j*G.A discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list raises concerns about the uniqueness of identification required to verify payments in Bitcoin. The four types of "proof of payment" discussed are: deniable payments, ability to prove directly to payee that an invoice was paid, ability to prove to a different business unit of the payee that payment was made, and third-party verifiable payment so you can associate a payment with real-world identity information and take them to court as a contract dispute. Anthony Towns expressed his opinion that Reddit is not a reliable platform for dispute resolution.Rusty Russell from Blockstream has discussed the benefits and drawbacks of various methods for sending payments through Lightning Network. Payment splitting and joining could be possible if instructions on how to do it were encoded in the onion message. Proof-of-Payment (PoP) is vital for usability, and decorrelation can improve privacy at every step. Rusty suggests naming a 'write-once/accept-by-anyone' deal an "offer", and proposes adding a nonce to allow Atomic Multi-Path (AMP).In another email conversation on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj suggests that in the payer-supplied data case, 'm' should include a signature for a key only the payer knows, which would allow them to prove they made the payment. Rusty questions whether the merchant (payee) could also produce this proof. Anthony Towns proposed adding optional support for using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages to version 1.1 of the lightning spec, which would require nodes in the payment path to support it. The plan would be to provide two `p` fields in transition for invoices, supporting both old and new payment hash variants. Channel announcements would need to specify whether they support secp256k1 or just sha256.</p>
