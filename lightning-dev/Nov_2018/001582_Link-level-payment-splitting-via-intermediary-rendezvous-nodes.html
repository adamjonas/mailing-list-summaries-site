    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to use HORNET, which supports rendezvous routing and is formally proven in a model. This seems to be the logical path forward given that there has already been considerable work towards implementing HORNET via Sphinx. A discussion was had regarding a mechanism for introducing re-routing or rendezvous routing on the Lightning Network. In one scenario, C is the payer and creates a route from itself to D (via channel C->D or via C->A->D) with E providing the onion-wrapped route D->E with ephemeral key and other necessary data. In another scenario, B knows the entire route B->C->D->E and knows that payee is C but the CD channel is low capacity or down, so B has provided the onion-wrapped route D->E with ephemeral key and other necessary data to C. A problem was raised with the mechanism proposed during the spec meeting as it violates the wrap-resistance property of the ideal onion routing scheme defined in [1]. Christian Decker proposes a solution involving rendez-vous RV receiving an onion, performing ECDH like normal to get the shared secret, decrypting its payload, simultaneously encrypting the padding, extracting the per-hop payload and shifting the entire packet over, then noticing that it should perform an ephemeral key switch, zero-filling the padding that it just added and performing ECDH with the switched in ephemeral key to get a new shared secret that which is then used to unwrap one additional layer of encryption, and most importantly encrypt the padding so the next hop doesn't see the zero-filled padding.</p>
