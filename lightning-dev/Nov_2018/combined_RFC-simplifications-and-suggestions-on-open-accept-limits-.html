        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about the Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol, Gert-Jaap Glasbergen raised concerns regarding routing payments with fractions of satoshis. He explained that while he wouldn't be worse off accepting such payments, the protocol demands routes to send out fractions as well even though they don't exist on-chain, resulting in a lower balance on-chain due to rounding. In response, Christian Decker suggested setting the fee_base_msat to at least 2000 msat to ensure every HTLC route pays at least a satoshi, or to 1000 msat if willing to route payments for free after rounding. The conversation also touched on using the dust limit as an atomic unit and the flexibility of keeping msatoshis. While Glasbergen advocated for options in the protocol to allow implementations to choose their preferred security levels, Decker argued this would add more complexity to routing.</p>
