    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to CJP, ZmnSCPxj discussed a potential scenario where a powerful participant in the Lightning network starts enforcing KYC requirements on nodes. ZmnSCPxj suggests that the rest of the network should punish this participant by closing any channel to it and doing retaliatory preemptive closing of any channel to any participant publicly connecting, directly or indirectly, to that participant. This would greatly lower its fee earnings as well as its ability to monitor or control the network. However, ZmnSCPxj believes that having the feature to not require payees to maintain even a pseudonym on the Lightning Network is desirable for privacy reasons. If all generated invoices use rendezvous routing, then the payee will not have an identifiable pseudonym on-Lightning. ZmnSCPxj also thinks that the destination should choose the nodes on its half of the route and pay for fees, with the source only required to deliver the specified amount to the first hop node of the destination half of the rendezvous route.</p>
