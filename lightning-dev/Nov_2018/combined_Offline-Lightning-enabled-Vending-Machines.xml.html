        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A solution has been proposed to prevent theft in vending machines, even when they are offline and lack secret keys. Each machine contains a predetermined number of hashes and corresponding invoice signatures, with each hash having a 1-bit flag that is set to 1 once claimed. When a customer requests a purchase, the machine generates an invoice, and the customer pays normally. The owner of the vending machine receives the payment and releases the preimage as proof-of-payment. If the preimage is valid, the product is released, and the claim flag is set for the corresponding hash. The supply of hashes can be replenished by the owner, but refunds are not possible in case of mechanical failure.A meta-vending machine idea has also been shared by ZmnSCPxj, which contains vending machines and dispenses them for proof-of-payment. The boxes in the machine are empty initially, and their contents are visible. A seller can rent one of the boxes by paying the meta-vending machine owner and requesting an invoice. When someone purchases the product, the meta-vending machine provides the invoice and opens the box in exchange for the preimage to the hash in the invoice. If the product remains unsold, the seller can provide the preimage and retrieve their item. This system could be used to sell small items or serve as an anonymous rendezvous point for exchanging small items for money. However, trust in the meta-vending machine owner is necessary since they have the ability to open any box and take its contents.</p>
