    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Lightning-dev post by Rene Pickhardt discusses the Base AMP proposal, which could be implemented via PR for BOLT04 and BOLT11. Pickhardt details three issues that need verification, clarification, and proposing with the community. The first two issues pertain to how nodes signal support for Base AMP and multipath payments respectively. The third issue is whether to create paths that need to be merged by intermediary nodes, which is not recommended as it may not be possible or practical. Pickhardt proposes an algorithm for executing a multipath payment, which involves dividing and conquering available routes to send payments within the network. Another idea, which Pickhardt admits is not ideal, is to allow nodes on a partial path to send hints of additional capacity they can forward if they see that the partial payment feature bit is set. In the same thread, Anthony Towns opines that simplicity and reliability are crucial aspects to improve in Lightning Network. He suggests having the flag included in invoices rather than gossiped to increase simplicity. Furthermore, he believes endpoint-only merging is better for reliability than in-route merging. In the case where fees rise later, the approach can be revisited.</p>
