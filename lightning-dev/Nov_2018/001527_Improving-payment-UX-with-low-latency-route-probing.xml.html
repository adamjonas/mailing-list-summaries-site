    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Laolu and Fabrice, Pierre suggests that HORNET could potentially address an issue brought up by Fabrice. However, Pierre questions whether HORNET would fully solve the problem as it operates at a lower layer and may not be able to handle cases where a peer is unresponsive but still has a valid circuit. Pierre also brings up the possibility of peers not sending revocations but still responding to pings. Upon re-reading Fabrice's proposal, Pierre wonders if the 0-satoshi payment would require the commit_sig/revoke_and_ack dance and if implementing this would improve confidence in the availability of peers in the route. Amidst the discussion, Pierre suggests disconnecting from nodes that take too long to send a revocation, which he believes would substantially improve the issue at hand. Pierre proposes adding this suggestion to BOLT 2 as a "SHOULD" clause. He notes that he had previously suggested doing this in lnd but it was not implemented in eclair.</p>
