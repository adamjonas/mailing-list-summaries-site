    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email correspondence on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, Rusty Russell discussed what the lightning payment flow might look like in the future. He suggested that v1.1 of the Lightning Network specification should include experimental/optional support for using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages. However, he acknowledged that since every intermediary needs to support it, considerable buy-in would be required before committing to it in 1.1. Russell outlined several components that would need to be included, such as invoices and channel announcements that support both sha256 and secp256k1 preimages, as well as global feature bits that preferentially establish channels with nodes supporting specific features. He believes that this is a necessary precondition for payment decorrelation, AMP, and third-party verifiable proof-of-payment. Russell also touched upon Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP), which splits and joins incoming payments, and proposed a general scheme involving a random group-marker and encrypted data for low-AMP.</p>
