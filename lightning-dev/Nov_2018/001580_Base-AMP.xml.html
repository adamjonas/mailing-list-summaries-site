    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj proposed a new feature to support Base AMP. The proposed feature called `multipath_merge_per_hop` type (`option_base_amp`) would allow arbitrary merges of paths but not arbitrary splits, as ZmnSCPxj is uncertain about the safety of arbitrary splits. The proposal includes a detailed description of the `multipath_merge_per_hop` type, which indicates that payment has been split by the sender using Base AMP, and that the receiver should wait for the total intended payment before forwarding or claiming the payment. If the receiving node is not the last node in the path, then succeeding hops must be the same across all splits. The contents of this hop will be the same across all paths of the Base AMP. The `intended_total_payment` is the total amount of money that this node should expect to receive in all incoming paths to the same `payment_hash`. The receiver must impose a reasonable timeout for waiting to receive all component paths and fail all incoming HTLC offers for the `payment_hash` if they have not totaled equal to `intended_total_payment`. The sender must use the same `payment_hash` for all paths of a single multipath payment.Johan asks whether they should name the payments accordingly since they are no longer atomic. It is unclear what Johan is referring to specifically, but it may relate to the proposed Base AMP feature. The email thread provides technical details about the new feature, including the data format and behavior of nodes in the network.</p>
