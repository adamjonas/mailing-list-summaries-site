    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj proposed the concept of link-level payment splitting and re-routing. Even with a single channel to the next node (c-lightning), it is possible to perform link-level payment splitting/re-routing. The idea involves routing payments through alternative channels if the primary channel is saturated in favor of the destination. For example, in a graph where B needs to route a payment from C to D to E, but the channel direction is saturated in favor of D, C can route to D via A instead. It holds the encrypted route from D to E, which can be taken as a partial route-to-payee under rendezvous routing. This allows for re-routing or payment splitting over multiple hops. Although C may not know the number of remaining hops between D and the destination, it is an alternative to failing the routing and earning nothing.</p>
