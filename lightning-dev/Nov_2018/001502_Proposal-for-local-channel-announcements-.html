    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange between ZmnSCPxj and Rusty Russell, ZmnSCPxj proposed that the incentives for non-public channels are flawed. Non-public channels are intended to keep public maps small, but users of these channels are not paid for providing this service. In fact, they pay for their non-public channels by revealing to the other user of the channel that they are the only possible source/destination of payments. Instead, ZmnSCPxj proposed a different mechanism where on channel open, the initiator of the channel indicates a "local" or "global" channel. "Local" channels are only gossiped up to some small number of nodes away, say 3. This still reduces the sizes of maps, while providing an increased anonymity set in the number of possible users of the local channel. ZmnSCPxj suspects that a "last mile" problem exists with non-public channels and their incentives. Rusty Russell agrees that there is an information advantage for public nodes in this scenario, but believes that more routes mean more fees.</p>
