        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The context of this message relates to the complexity of the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) system and its impact on fee payment responsibilities. The proposed changes to RBF have been simplified for clarity, but multiple exclusive splices will still require extensive testing. The initiator of a splice should ensure that each splice_input refers to an existing UTXO, and a null splice is allowed to reset parameters or discard history. Splicing is risky as it may lead to channel closure due to extenuating circumstances like a fee spike, and only one splice can be in progress at a time. Once a splice_initiator indicates satisfaction with the splice, the other party can add their own splice-ins and outs. However, RBF adds a new dimension as it requires multiple exclusive splices at once. It is suggested to define a dual-funding RBF protocol first to practice for splice RBF.The email exchange between Lisa Neigut and Rusty Russell discusses the `splice_confirm` feature in the Lightning Network protocol. They suggest that the `signature` field may not be required since the signatures for inputs can be provided through the witness stack. Commitment transactions need to be duplicated for every splice transaction, and it is questioned whether HTLCs should also be duplicated. CPFP is suggested as a neater construction than RBF, but using RBF is better for on-chain space. It is also suggested to move towards using TLV.Regarding message changes during splicing, the `commitment_signed` and `channel_reestablish` messages are relevant. If a reconnection occurs between sending and receiving splice_confirm or splice_closed, there is a new field in channel_reestablish to flag that the end considers themselves to be splicing. The recipient must handle `splice_commitment_signature` on the new splice transaction and continue negotiation as before. The option_data_loss_protect fields should be set if option_splice is used.Overall, the context highlights the proposed changes to the RBF system and its impact on fee payment responsibilities. The email exchange between Lisa Neigut and Rusty Russell discusses various aspects related to the `splice_confirm` function in the Lightning Network protocol, including the use of signatures, commitment transactions, and the option to move towards using TLV.</p>
