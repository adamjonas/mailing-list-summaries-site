    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns and Jim Posen discussed the possibility of charging for liquidity in a channel on Bitcoin's lightning network. Posen suggested charging for the amount in mSAT/BTC times time, which means the longer the channel remains open, the more fees are charged. Towns proposed a market could be established by creating a channel with a payment of 32 msat per 500 satoshi per hour for the first 3 days. If the channel fails before the three days is up and payments stop, the other party would not receive payment. However, a second node could potentially game the system by sending payments through the channel to meet the rate and capture the fees for the first node. To make the attack less feasible, Towns suggests charging higher transmission fees. The idea is still in its early stages and may require a complicated addition to the protocol.</p>
