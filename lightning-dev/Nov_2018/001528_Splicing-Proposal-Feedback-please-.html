    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty Russell discussed the limitations of their descriptor language. Extracting descriptions from the spec for each message is not easy due to the current tools/extract-formats.py which requires constants in the field lengths, and these would be variable. They also talked about messages within messages that they have to teach it. Rusty Russell mentioned that they are co-generating a transaction like shutdown but instead, it's funding a new replacement channel. He suggested that they anchor down this splicing transaction given that they may only allow a single outstanding splicing operation to begin with. This way, they can speed up the process if they want to queue another operation up right afterwards. However, he added that it means they will almost always have to CPFP, which is unfortunate for chain bloat.</p>
