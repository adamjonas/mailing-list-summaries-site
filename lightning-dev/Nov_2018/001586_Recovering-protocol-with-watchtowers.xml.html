    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The use of a node public key as the key for backup in a solution and its incompatibility with watchtowers, which are currently designed to be keyed to a txid, is discussed. The use of txid is important for privacy reasons as it does not identify the node. A scheme that encrypts payload information on the public key of the node and uses channel ID to prevent malicious activity is suggested. However, this solution is vulnerable to corrupted backup data, which would render the operation of the node irrecoverable. It is also noted that each watchtower must have a distinct payment channel, thus raising questions about why the watchtower is keyed to the node rather than something specific to each payment channel. DHT is recommended as a better alternative for distributed backup implementation.</p>
