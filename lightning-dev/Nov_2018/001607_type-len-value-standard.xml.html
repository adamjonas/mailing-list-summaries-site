    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the structure of `type,len,value` sequence where the `type`s must be in ascending order. Even though descending would make just as much sense, it's better to have them in ascending order for a naive parser. The length of `type` is suggested to be one byte instead of two to avoid creating a new message type for 256 optional fields. For an even `type` that is not known, it is suggested to crash and burn to maintain consistency. However, this could depend on the context of the gossip messages or link-level messages. It is also proposed to use varint for the length of `len` since one byte is not enough for all lengths, but two seems excessive for uint8 or even uint32. A separate BOLT document is proposed for `type,len,value` to add new fields proposed in 1.1 and to help spec and verify the t-l-v data structures (a mapping from u16 to binary blobs) separately. At the t-l-v level, there would only be binary blobs for the value, and separate parts of the software would understand what the actual meanings of those blobs are.</p>
