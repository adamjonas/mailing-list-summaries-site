        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>René Pickhardt, a member of the Lightning Network team, proposed implementing an additional routing algorithm to address slow and failing payments on the network. The proposed solution involves local payment fragmentation or local AMP, allowing intermediate nodes to fragment a payment and find alternative paths to forward it without compromising privacy. One strategy suggested is using friend-of-a-friend information to determine whether the original HTLC can be forwarded from Alice to Bob in a fragmented way. The autopilot could also benefit from this approach by creating many triangles in the network for friend-of-a-friend nodes to exist. The sender can still choose the basic route, while the full route remains private. However, the original payer must allow a package to be locally fragmented by including more fees at each hop and increasing the CLTV deltas in each hop so that an additional hop can be included and financed. If this approach is too complex or expensive, two nodes that fail to forward the HTLCs could work together to find a path between them and return this information as a routing suggestion to the payer. To further improve payment reliability, ZmnSCPxj suggested using active probing and ping before commitment. Ping before commit reduces the window for stuck payments by pinging the next node before offering an HTLC, allowing us to figure out if the connection dropped before sending the HTLC.</p>
