        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rene Pickhardt, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed implementing a second routing algorithm for the system. The new algorithm would work through local payment fragmentation or "local AMP", allowing intermediate nodes to fragment an HTLC to forward payments. One suggested approach to finding paths would be sharing friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) information, which could enable Alice to look at nodes that she and Bob are connected to and use them as bridge nodes for the payment. While this would require additional fees and increased CLTV deltas, it would still allow payers to select a basic route and keep the full route private. Meanwhile, active probing and "ping before commitment" have also been proposed as measures to improve payment reliability on the Lightning Network.</p>
