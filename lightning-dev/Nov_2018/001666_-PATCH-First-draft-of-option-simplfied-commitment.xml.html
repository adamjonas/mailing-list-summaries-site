    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the implementation of a change that assumes two things, firstly, a change in relay policy around CPFP and secondly, a basic package relay in Bitcoin Core. The first change requires further discussion but has gained support and is easy to implement, while the second one requires more work but has been a long-standing goal. The discussion then moves on to the issue of how the commitment transaction gets relayed for its 'to_*_pushme' outputs to be spent for CPFP fee bumping. The concern is that if mempools fill up again and BIP133 feefilters are increased by any amount, nodes will no longer relay transactions with minimum feerates, making it difficult to relay the commitment transaction. There is currently no provision in Bitcoin Core to relay transaction packages consisting of parents below the relay fee limit and children sufficiently above the limit to pay for their parents, although it has been discussed previously.</p>
