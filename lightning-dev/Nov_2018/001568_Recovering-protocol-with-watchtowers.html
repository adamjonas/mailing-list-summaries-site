    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Margherita, a member of the dev-lightning community, shared an update on her thesis project which focuses on the recovering mechanism of false positive in the Lightning network. In her design, she considers a watchtower as a full node that is online 24/7 and uses it to back up commitments data. Margherita defines two new concepts, nonce-time Tn, and payload P, and encrypts the payload with the public key of the node A so that watchtowers cannot know the status channel of A. Margherita proposes sending the actual nonce-time and the actual payload to one of the watchtowers and just send the new nonce-time to the others to split the data into different watchtowers without sending the payload after each transaction to all of them. When Alice needs to have the backup of all her data, she has to ask all her watchtowers the information connected to her node. Margherita suggests using more than one watchtower to mitigate the risk of a single watchtower being attacked and all data inside being deleted. She also proposes sending a small fee through the lightning channel every time a node requests data to the watchtower for the backup to encourage the watchtowers to guarantee the service every time.Margherita's design mitigates risks such as a watchtower sending an older payload instead of the last one and watchtowers changing the nonce-time. However, there is still a risk if 51% of the watchtower agrees to cheat and sends another nonce-time to the node. Margherita asks for feedback on overlapping the concept of watchtower with the mechanism of backup.</p>
