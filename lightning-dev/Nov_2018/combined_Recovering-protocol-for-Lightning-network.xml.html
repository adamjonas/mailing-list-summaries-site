        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Margherita Favaretto attended the recent "LightningHackdayNYC" event and presented her project on a recovering protocol for Lightning Network. The project aims to address the issue of false positive nodes in the Eltoo mechanism, which does not cover the scenario where the other node shares an older transaction that is more favorable for their balance. Margherita's solution involves using other connected nodes as a backup for one's recent status. She has created a GitHub project where she welcomes feedback and comments on her draft research.For each transaction between two nodes connected to a third node, A sends an encrypted information about the last commitment transaction with B to C, and for each commitment transaction with C, A sends an encrypted information about the last commitment transaction with C to B. This allows A to retrieve the information from the other connected node if it loses the last transactions, enabling it to update the status. Margherita believes that this idea can solve the current lack in Eltoo and is keen to analyze it further in the next few days.Johan, another member of the community, suggested that Margherita should look into "data loss protection" as defined in the BOLTs, which is similar to her proposal, as well as watchtowers and static and dynamic channel backups. Margherita invites thoughts and suggestions for proceeding in the wisest way and finding a solution that can also cover all needs. She is open to sharing more details about the design of her idea and collaborating to work together with anyone interested in this research.</p>
