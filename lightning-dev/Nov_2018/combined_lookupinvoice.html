        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Sarat G has been working on the LN repository and is searching for a way for a payee to look up an invoice that has been paid, similar to the 'lookupinvoice' command provided by lnd (Golang). However, it is unclear which LN repository Sarat is referring to as there are several. Rusty provides information on the different APIs available for LN repositories and mentions that lnd has 'lookupinvoice', eclair has 'checkpayment', and c-lightning has 'listinvoices' or 'wait(any)invoice'. Sarat's problem is that there is a hub where players make payments of different amounts, and the hub node needs to keep track of which player paid which invoice. Sarat is seeking assistance in finding a combination of commands that can help with this task. Sarat had been working on the C lightning repo for a while and was looking for a way to determine whether an invoice created by it is paid or not.Rusty Russell pointed out that Sarat could use listinvoices to look up invoices created at the node, or wait(any)invoice for polling. Rusty also provided information on similar commands in other LN repos, such as lookupinvoice in lnd, checkpayment in eclair, and listinvoices in c-lightning. Sarat mentioned that using waitinvoice makes the process hang until the invoice gets paid, but is currently using a workaround where he looks up the difference in amount of the label "msatoshi_to_us" while running the listpeers command. To summarize, Sarat G is searching for a way for a payee to look up an invoice that has been paid, similar to the 'lookupinvoice' command provided by lnd (Golang), across different LN repositories. Rusty Russell suggests using listinvoices or wait(any)invoice in c-lightning while pointing out similar commands in other LN repos. Sarat is facing difficulty in keeping track of which player paid which invoice, and is seeking assistance in finding a combination of commands that can help with this task.</p>
