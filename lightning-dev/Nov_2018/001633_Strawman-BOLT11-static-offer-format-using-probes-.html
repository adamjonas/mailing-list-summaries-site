    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to Rusty Russell, René Pickhardt asked for clarification on the term "lightning probe message" which he couldn't find in the current BOLTs. Rusty responded that it would be a new message and one was proposed for liveness testing of routes pre-payment. He also explained that the payer should create an onion package which triggers the offering of HTLCs with additional metadata so that the recipient of the final onion can answer with a BOLT11 invoice. Rusty clarified that there is no need for payment hash to offer HTLCs. René further suggested having a connection-oriented communication layer on top of the current protocol which could allow payer and payee to communicate more efficiently about the payment and routing process. Rusty responded by recommending reading the paper on HORNET and explained the lack of incentives as well as privacy concerns. He admitted that the message is the camel's nose in the tent but they're building a payment network, not a generalized communication network.</p>
