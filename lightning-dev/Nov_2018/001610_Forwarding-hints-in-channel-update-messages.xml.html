    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, Rusty Russell announced that extra channel_updates will be allowed in errors for "upselling" purposes. However, it was questioned how this would be useful for non-strict forwarding nodes, as sending a channel_update in certain cases may not actually be helpful. Joost added that perhaps the forwarding hint that non-strict forwarding was applied could be communicated as a node property via a global feature bit, which would save time for the sender in trying other channels from that node to the next if they receive a TemporaryChannelFailure. This suggestion is more practical and less specific than using extra channel_updates for upselling.</p>
