        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread discusses a potential solution to freeing up scarce resources on the network by making probing routes more efficient and cancelling stuck probes from both the sending and receiving direction. The risk of probing is that if a probe discovers a failing node/channel, it will get stuck, using up HTLC slots and memory for each of the well-behaved nodes. The proposed solution suggests generating a 128b random number X, calculating H=bitwise-not(SHA256(X)), making a probe payment over path P, hash H, amount V, and waiting for response.To ensure reliability in payment routing, one could allow cancelling stuck probes from both directions. This can involve generating a payment hash as SHA256("something") XOR 0xFF..FF or similar, and sending a packet saying this was a probe along with the "something" to verify, and freeing up the slot/funds from the probe. However, an attacker may still choose not to do this. Overall, this solution provides an option for someone making an honest effort to probe the network to not inadvertently attack it in case a probe fails.</p>
