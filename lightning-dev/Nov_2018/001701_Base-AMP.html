    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggested using a 2-byte "number of total pieces" to split the bill, but this method wouldn't work well in all cases. For example, it wouldn't work with a dynamic algorithm that tries to pay the whole amount at once and then splits it if it doesn't fit. Rusty Russell explained that using `numpaths` overcommits to what you will do in the future, and is unnecessary anyway. The payee is interested in the total value, not the details of the split.They also discussed a network where there are four paths between payer and payee; three paths have low capacity but negligible feerate, while the fourth has high capacity with expensive feerates. In order to minimize fees when paying a large amount, it would be rational to split among the three low-cost paths. However, if two of those paths fail, it would be better to merge them into a single payment along the expensive fourth path. The remaining succeeding path has already given `numpaths`=3.</p>
