        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj, a member of the Lightning Development Summit 2018, discussed that every Lightning implementation needs to have its own onchain wallet implementation. SIGHASH_NOINPUT would allow Lightning implementations to be "walletless". The first pair of commitment transactions will need to be signed with SIGHASH_NOINPUT, then the funding transaction can be created using a normal wallet. This would reduce the number of transactions needed when users prefer to use a specific wallet implementation that may have features unavailable in the Lightning implementation. Additionally, this would reduce implementation complexity for Lightning implementations, as there would only need to trace status (unconfirmed/confirmed, spent/unspent) specific transaction outputs, not scan the blockchain for specific `scriptPubKey`. However, Dave Harding raised a concern that committing to the transaction fees for various delayed-broadcast transactions could lead to committing to an undesirable high feerate. Therefore, better ways to integrate onchain wallets with protocols that delay between signing and broadcast should be considered instead.</p>
