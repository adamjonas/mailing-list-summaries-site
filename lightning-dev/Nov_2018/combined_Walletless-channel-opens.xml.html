        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Development Summit 2018 will not be discussing SIGHASH_NOINPUT as it is out of scope, but it is still an interesting topic to consider for future use. Currently, every Lightning implementation must have its own onchain wallet implementation due to the specific order in which transactions are signed and broadcast during the channel opening protocol. However, with the use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT, Lightning implementations could become "walletless". The first pair of commitment transactions would need to be signed with SIGHASH_NOINPUT, then the funding transaction could be created using a normal wallet. This would reduce the number of transactions needed if users prefer to use a specific wallet implementation that has features unavailable to the Lightning implementation. It would also reduce implementation complexity for Lightning implementations.In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a user suggested that SIGHASH_NOINPUT could allow for walletless Lightning implementations. However, another user pointed out that this would require committing to transaction fees for delayed-broadcast transactions, such as the Eltoo trigger transaction, since adding additional inputs through RBF would not be possible without a wallet. This could lead to committing to high fees for a channel that may be open for weeks or months but needs to be closed quickly to prevent fraud. In an email exchange between David A. Harding and ZmnSCPxj on November 7, 2018, a discussion arose regarding Lightning implementations being "walletless".ZmnSCPxj had suggested that SIGHASH_NOINPUT would allow for this, but David A. Harding pointed out that without a wallet, committing to transaction fees for delayed-broadcast transactions would be necessary as additional fees cannot be added through RBF without a wallet. Therefore, they agreed that better integration of onchain wallets with protocols that delay between signing and broadcast should be considered instead.</p>
