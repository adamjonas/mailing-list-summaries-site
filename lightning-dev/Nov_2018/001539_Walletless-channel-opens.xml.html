    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Development Summit 2018 will not be discussing SIGHASH_NOINPUT as it is out of scope, but it is still an interesting topic to consider for future use. Currently, every Lightning implementation must have its own onchain wallet implementation due to the specific order in which transactions are signed and broadcast during the channel opening protocol. However, with the use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT, Lightning implementations could become "walletless". The first pair of commitment transactions would need to be signed with SIGHASH_NOINPUT, then the funding transaction could be created using a normal wallet. This would reduce the number of transactions needed if users prefer to use a specific wallet implementation that has features unavailable to the Lightning implementation. It would also reduce implementation complexity for Lightning implementations.</p>
