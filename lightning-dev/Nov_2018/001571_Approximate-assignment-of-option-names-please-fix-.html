    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post, Rusty Russell shared his thoughts on global vs local bit feature masks. In the post, he mentions that he has made up option names for the feature masks, but has not yet assigned numbers to them. He then goes on to describe the difference between local and global features. Local features only affect the protocol between two nodes, while global features can affect HTLCs and are advertised to other nodes. Rusty suggests that there may be instances where one would want to promote their local bit to a global bit in order to advertise it, specifically mentioning "wumbo." However, he notes that if every node is expected to eventually support a certain bit, it should probably stay local. Rusty concludes the post by asking users to edit their bits as appropriate so that he can assign bit numbers soon. The link to the Lightning Specification 1.1 Proposal States can be found in the post for those who wish to make edits.</p>
