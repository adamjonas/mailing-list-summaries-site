    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Anthony Towns and Rusty on the issue of payer-supplied data case suggests that a signature for a key only the payer knows should be included in 'm' to help prove that they made the payment. This would prevent sock puppets from claiming delivery by providing proof of payment. The discussion also covers how secp256k1 AMP works with the scheme, which requires the customer to send three payments to the vendor conditional on preimages for A, B, and C, calculated with H(,) construction. Additionally, the discussion explores the possibility of source-directed splits and joins, which is deemed impractical. Finally, the idea of including URLs is dismissed due to its unsigned externality and poor privacy properties.</p>
