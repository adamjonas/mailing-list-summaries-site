    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list discussion, Rene suggested creating a wiki page to make the process transparent and link it from README.md. He expressed that the current process is new to him and newcomers cannot be expected to read through the entire mailing list. Matt Corallo expressed his preference for substantive discussions to happen on GitHub or the mailing list rather than in live meetings, which he believes is unfair to those who cannot regularly attend or miss the meeting where the topic they care about is discussed. Rusty Russell proposed revisiting the current process rules as they approach 1.1, suggesting moving to an IRC meeting and having a more formal approval method for PRs. He also added milestones to PRs as 1.0/1.1 and aims to clear all 1.0 PRs this week for tagging in the next meeting. The discussion thread ended with a link to the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
