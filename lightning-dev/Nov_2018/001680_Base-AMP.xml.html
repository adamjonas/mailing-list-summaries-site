    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion about the implementation of Partial Payments (PP) in spontaneous payments, Johan Tor√•s Halseth suggested the addition of an optional field to the invoice and letting the recipient wait until all funds have been received before pulling the payment. This proposal would not require any changes to the onion. The suggestion was discussed briefly in a previous call and it was determined that the extra bit set in the onion would be necessary to support PP in spontaneous payments.During the discussion, the use case of splitting a bill came up. It was noted that if a BOLT11 invoice does not specify an amount, it must include a specific minimum amount for successful payment. Initially, a 2-byte "number of total pieces" was suggested, but it was found that this wouldn't work well for splitting the bill since each payer is unrelated and doesn't know how the others are paying.As a solution to this issue, Rusty has written up an onion proposal to cover it.</p>
