        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj proposed adding two feature bits to the Lightning Network protocol on the Lightning-dev platform. The first feature bit, `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo`, would indicate that a node is willing to "wumbo" with its counterpart in a connection, while the second feature bit, `option_anyone_can_wumbo`, would indicate that the node is willing to wumbo with any other node. Laolu pointed out an inconsistency in the newer section of the spec concerning the optional max_htlc value and suggested that the wumbo bit should also encompass wumbo payments.ZmnSCPxj noted that much of the wumbo payments would be implemented by AMP, and if there is no direct path of wumborama nodes from payer to payee, then wumbo payments will have to be done by AMP. It would be nice if we could have AMP merge into intermediate nodes instead of always at the destination, so that only the suffix of the path needs to be wumborama. Rusty Russell chimed in with a suggestion to name `option_anyone_can_wumbo` to `option_wumborama`.The proposal includes creating a local feature bit `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` to indicate that the node is willing to wumbo with its counterparty in the connection and a global feature bit `option_anyone_can_wumbo` to indicate that the node is willing to wumbo with any node. A node must set the local feature bit if it sets the global feature bit in its announcement and may clear the global feature bit even if it sends a set `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` to its peer. Additionally, a node may report different values for `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` to different nodes. If a node did not set the `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` feature bit reported to its counterparty, it must respond with an `error` if it receives an `open_channel` with a `funding_satoshis` value beyond the indicated limit for the chain.To address concerns over limited channel sizes, the proposal suggests creating a whitelist of node pubkeys that the node owner considers safe to accept making wumbo channels with. Reckless users could set an option in the software to be willing to wumbo with any node. Overall, the discussion focused on how to ensure that wumbo channels and payments are properly implemented and how to address any inconsistencies in the spec.</p>
