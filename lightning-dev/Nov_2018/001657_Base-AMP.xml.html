    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Rusty Russell, Rusty gives advice on modifying a pull request. He warns ZmnSCPxj against playing with the `amount_to_forward` signal, which indicates to the final node that the previous node did not offer less value for the HTLC than it was supposed to. Instead, he suggests using the `incomplete_payment` flag to ensure that final nodes only claim HTLCs if the sum of incoming HTLC amounts is greater than or equal to the amount to be paid. Rusty argues that this approach eliminates the assurance that this particular HTLC hasn't been skimmed by the previous node. Rusty further explains that recipients do not need to know the total amount meant to be paid; they just need to return the receipt once it exceeds the amount they want.</p>
