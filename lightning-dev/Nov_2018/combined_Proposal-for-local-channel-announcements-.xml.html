        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell has proposed creating "local" channel announcements to increase payment deniability for nodes with only private channels. Currently, such nodes lose deniability of payments as unannounced channels reveal the sender. The proposed mechanism would allow a public node to suggest a fake short channel id unique to it and the private node can reply with its signature on the `local_channel_announcement` message using its chosen key. The announcement can be generated by the public node, but it cannot be propagated, and `Channel_update` works as before.ZmnSCPxj proposed that the incentives for non-public channels are flawed and users of these channels are not paid for providing this service. He proposed a mechanism where the initiator of the channel indicates a "local" or "global" channel on open. "Local" channels are only gossiped up to some small number of nodes away, say 3. This provides an increased anonymity set in the number of possible users of the local channel while reducing the sizes of maps. Rusty agrees that there is an information advantage for public nodes in this scenario, but more routes mean more fees.ZmnSCPxj also seeks clarification from Rusty on a topic related to private and public nodes in a channel, where the public node initiates the protocol. Rusty confirms that having more routes means more fees, but a peer can always offer substandard service, so he doesn't think the situation is worse. Feedback on the proposal is welcome.</p>
