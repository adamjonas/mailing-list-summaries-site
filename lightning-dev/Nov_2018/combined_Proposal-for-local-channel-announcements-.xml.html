        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj and Rusty Russell have been discussing the topic of private and public nodes in a channel. Currently, there is a "private" node that keeps all non-published channels, and a public node that benefits from knowing everything passing through the channel with the "private" node comes only from it. Rusty confirms this understanding and notes that having more routes means more fees. To increase deniability of payments for nodes with only private channels, Rusty has proposed creating "local" channel announcements that only propagate one hop, which would increase deniability. The public node would suggest a fake short channel id unique to it, and if the private node wants to use this id for the channel announcement, it replies with a signature on the `local_channel_announcement` message using its chosen key.In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj proposed that the incentives for non-public channels are flawed, as users of these channels are not paid for providing the service of keeping public maps small. Instead, ZmnSCPxj suggested a mechanism where on channel open, the initiator indicates a "local" or "global" channel. "Local" channels are only gossiped up to some small number of nodes away, say 3. This still reduces the sizes of maps while providing an increased anonymity set in the number of possible users of the local channel. Rusty agrees that there is an information advantage for public nodes in this scenario, but believes that more routes mean more fees.</p>
