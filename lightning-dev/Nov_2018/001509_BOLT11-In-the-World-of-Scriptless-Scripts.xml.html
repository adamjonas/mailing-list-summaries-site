    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Lightning-dev mailing list, a member named "ZmnSCPxj" raised concerns about the uniqueness of identification required to verify payments in Bitcoin. He gave an example where AJ posts on Reddit that he has made a payment and demands goods, but a sock puppet claims to be AJ from Australia and provides the same proof. Another member responded by explaining that technically, all AJ in Australia needs to show is that they know the private key behind the public key indicated on the invoice. However, using Reddit as a court is not considered viable, and there are multiple types of "proof of payment" people might desire.The four types of "proof of payment" discussed are: deniable payments, ability to prove directly to payee that an invoice was paid, ability to prove to a different business unit of the payee that payment was made, and third-party verifiable payment so you can associate a payment with real-world identity information and take them to court as a contract dispute. The latter requires a PKI infrastructure for mapping pubkeys to the real-world people.</p>
