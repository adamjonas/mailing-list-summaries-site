        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is facing challenges in terms of onboarding and usability, specifically when it comes to offering liquidity. Several proposed solutions have been discussed by experts. One suggested solution is to charge for the amount of liquidity provided multiplied by time, rather than a flat payment. Another model involves pre-paying on fees, where a large merchant can put up liquidity for a channel and earn fees on payments routed through that channel. However, this requires factoring in reputation, as HTLC withholding/loop attacks could occur.To address the issue of offering inbound capacity, a proposal has been made to allow nodes to advertise initial liquidity matching, which would create a market of inbound capacity that any node can take advantage of, reducing out-of-band negotiation needed to obtain inbound capacity. This proposal involves adding three new feature flags to the node_announcement and allowing nodes to advertise that they will match liquidity and a fee rate for incoming open_channel requests. The proposal depends on dual funding being possible, and nodes unable to provide the requested liquidity must return an error.However, concerns have been raised about potential attack scenarios involving capturing fees. To mitigate these risks, modifications to channel commitment transactions and imposing minimum channel lifetimes have been suggested. Additionally, there have been debates over whether a node should be able to request more liquidity than they put into the channel on their half. While some argue that this could be dangerous, others believe that if the fee for liquidity is high enough, it may not matter whether the attacker uses the locked funds or not.In recent discussions, Anthony Towns and Jim Posen proposed the idea of charging for liquidity in a Bitcoin Lightning network channel. This would involve charging for the amount in mSAT/BTC times time, meaning that the longer the channel remains open, the more fees are charged. They also proposed creating a market by establishing a channel with a payment of 32 msat per 500 satoshi per hour for the first three days. However, there is concern that this could be gamed by a second node, and so further work may be needed to refine the proposal.In an email thread, Cezary Dziemian expressed frustration with the implementation of a project he had been working on for over a year. He initially built a prototype based on c-lightning but switched to LND due to issues with the former. However, he faced problems with LND as well as there were some missing API methods. To resolve the issue, he suggested building a cross-implementation group to work together. Cezary also mentions that his friend is willing to pay for the development of the project, and he prefers to write it in Java.Overall, the discussions among experts highlight the importance of considering potential attack scenarios and finding ways to align incentives to create a fair and secure way to offer liquidity on the Lightning Network.</p>
