        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developers have deferred the implementation of packet switching in the BOLT specification, but some features that could enable packet switching were not deferred. These features include multi-hop onion packets, identifying the "next" node by node-ID instead of short-channel-ID, and onion ephemeral key switching.A new packettype is proposed where the "next" node is identified by its node-ID. This would enable packet switching, increase anonymity set of rendezvous routing, allow mapless Lightning nodes to ask a peer to be their pathfinding provider with some uncertainty, and justify multiple features having a single feature bit. ZmnSCPxj proposed a method for packet switching in BOLT spec via multi-hop onion packets, identifying "next" by node-id instead of short-channel-id, and onion ephemeral key switching. The proposed packet types include packettype 0 (same as current realm 0), packettype 2 (ephemeral key switch), and packettype 4 (identify next node by node-id).During a discussion on Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian Decker pointed out that it won't be possible to have spontaneous ephemeral key switches while forwarding a payment. However, ZmnSCPxj suggested using packet switching as a way to route payments through multiple channels, allowing for more anonymity and increasing the network's capacity. In a discussion on the Lightning Network mailing list, Olaoluwa Osuntokun brought up the question of whether spontaneous ephemeral key switches would be possible while forwarding a payment. Andrew Poelstra replied that if this were possible, it could allow nodes to create unbounded path lengths and sidestep the 20 hop limit altogether by controlling multiple nodes in a route.</p>
