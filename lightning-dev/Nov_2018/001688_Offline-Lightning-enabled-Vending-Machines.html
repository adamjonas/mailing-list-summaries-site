    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj shares an idea of a meta-vending machine that contains vending machines and dispenses them for proof-of-payment. Each box in the machine is initially empty and the contents of each box are visible. If a seller wants to sell a product, they can rent one of these boxes by paying the meta-vending machine owner and then the box requests for their invoice. When someone decides to purchase the product, the meta-vending machine provides the invoice and opens the box in exchange for the preimage to the hash in the invoice. If the product is not sold, the seller can provide the preimage and get their product back. Such a system would be useful for selling small items and can also be used as an anonymous rendezvous point for transferring small items in exchange for money. However, trust is needed in the meta-vending machine owner as they have the ability to unlock any arbitrary box and take the item inside.</p>
