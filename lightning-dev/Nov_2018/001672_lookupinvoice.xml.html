    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sarat G has been working on the C lightning repo for a while and was looking for a way to determine whether an invoice created by it is paid or not. Rusty Russell pointed out that Sarat could use listinvoices to look up invoices created at the node, or wait(any)invoice for polling. Rusty also provided information on similar commands in other LN repos, such as lookupinvoice in lnd, checkpayment in eclair, and listinvoices in c-lightning. Sarat mentioned that using waitinvoice makes the process hang until the invoice gets paid, but is currently using a workaround where he looks up the difference in amount of the label "msatoshi_to_us" while running the listpeers command.</p>
