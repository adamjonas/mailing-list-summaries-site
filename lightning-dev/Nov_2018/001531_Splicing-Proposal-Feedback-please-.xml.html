    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Christian Decker have different opinions on the need to create multiple channels to a single peer or increase capacity with a specific peer. Osuntokun believes that it becomes less of a network and more like some channels to specific big businesses one transacts with regularly. However, Decker clarified that he wasn't referring to any "big businesses," only the utility that arises when one has multiple channels to a given peer. Having multiple channels allows for sending larger amounts of BTC and accommodating increased HTLC bandwidth load due to sharded multi-path payments. Even with bolstering the bandwidth capabilities of links to other nodes, maintaining a diverse set of channels is essential for fault tolerance, path diversity, and redundancy reasons. It is important to note that increasing limitations negotiated with a peer, such as max HTLC in flight and max channel capacity, through multiple channels is a roundabout way of doing so. Lifting those limitations would be a better solution.</p>
