        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev community is discussing the process rules for their 1.1 iteration as they approach the end of 1.0. The current process rules include biweekly Google Hangouts, requiring unanimous approval at the meeting before any substantive spec change can be applied, implementation changes requiring two interoperable implementations, and typo fixes requiring only two acknowledgments without a meeting necessary. They are considering moving to an IRC meeting, which would be more inclusive and better recorded but could be lower-bandwidth. Furthermore, they are considering having a more formal approval method for PRs with a "CONSENSUS:YES" tag that applies once they have acknowledgments from two teams and no Naks, followed by a meeting to review consensus, a "FINAL" tag, and commit the next meeting. Matt Corallo expressed his preference for substantive discussions to happen on GitHub or the mailing list instead of live meetings. He believes that textual communication poses fewer barriers than audio/visual meetings and that finalization during a live meeting is unfair to those who cannot attend regularly or missed the discussion. Peter Todd supports Matt's idea and adds that some people may not want their face or voice to be seen or heard during meetings. Rusty Russell suggested revisiting the current process rules as they approach 1.1 and aims to clear all 1.0 PRs this week for tagging in the next meeting. Despite the benefits of live meetings, it is acknowledged that doing finalization in a live meeting is unfair to those who can't find the time to attend regularly or happened to miss the one where the relevant discussion occurred. In a mailing list discussion, Rene suggested creating a wiki page to make the process transparent and link it from README.md. The latest call doc seems to be only somewhat sparsely attended. Matt suggests holding an IRC meeting at the same time as the regular calls on #lightning-dev.
