    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list is discussing the process rules for their 1.1 iteration, as they approach the end of 1.0. Currently, they have biweekly Google Hangouts, which require unanimous approval at the meeting before any substantive spec change can be applied. Implementation changes require two interoperable implementations before being considered final. Typo, formatting, and spelling fixes can be applied after two acknowledgments without a meeting necessary. As they approach 1.1, they are considering moving to an IRC meeting, which would be more inclusive and better recorded but could be lower-bandwidth. They are also considering having a more formal approval method for PRs with a "CONSENSUS:YES" tag that applies once they have acknowledgments from two teams and no Naks, followed by a meeting to review consensus, a "FINAL" tag, and commit the next meeting. This gives at least two weeks to comment on the final draft.Despite the benefits of live meetings, it is acknowledged that doing finalization in a live meeting is unfair to those who can't find the time to attend regularly or happened to miss the one where the relevant discussion occurred. Therefore, substantive discussions should preferably happen on GitHub or the mailing list. The current process rules will need to be revisited as they approach 1.1. Rusty Russell has added milestones to PRs as 1.0/1.1 and hopes to clear all 1.0 PRs this week for tagging in the next meeting, then start on 1.1 commits.</p>
