    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj, Rusty and aj, the topic of channel announcements was discussed. The question arose whether secp256k1 for hashes is supported or just sha256. ZmnSCPxj suggested that it is possible to have a route with channels alternating between 2p-ECDSA and Schnorr contingent payment schemes. He then went on to discuss a hypothetical scenario where Alice wants to pay Delilah some satoshis in exchange for k, but there is no direct channel between them. However, there is a route from Alice to Bob to Carol to Delilah. The problem is that Bob is using old software and all channels Bob has use only sha256. In the onion packet for Carol, Alice can put "the secret preimage k is known by Delilah, with the secp256k1 public key P, here's the proof (P == k * G) && (h == sha256(k))". This lets us make routes that are partially in secp256k1 and partially in sha256.</p>
