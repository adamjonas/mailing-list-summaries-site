    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a forum post, ZmnSCPxj provides some advice to Rusty on the importance of the `amount_to_forward` signal when sending payments over the Lightning Network. The signal indicates that the previous node did not offer less value for the HTLC than it was supposed to. ZmnSCPxj warns against playing with this signal, as it could lead to partial payment and lost assurance that a specific HTLC has not been skimmed by the previous node.ZmnSCPxj goes on to explain that if the `incomplete_payment` flag is set, final nodes must only claim HTLCs if the sum of incoming HTLC amounts is greater than or equal to the amount to be paid. This total includes all incoming HTLCs terminating at the final node with the same payment hash.However, Rusty argues that it may be unnecessary for the recipient to know the total amount intended for payment. They just need to return the receipt once it exceeds the amount they want. Rusty suggests reducing the outgoing HTLC amount to 1 satoshi if they suspect a payment is using Base-AMP. If it doesn't fail immediately, then the next hop is the final destination.</p>
