        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing various proposals related to payment routing in the Lightning Network. One proposal involves using multiple rendezvous nodes, but there were concerns about possible security degradation due to this added flexibility. Another proposal involves an additional ECDH at the rendezvous point, one ChaCha20 encryption, and one scalar multiplication to generate the next ephemeral keys. Despite issues with this proposal, there is still potential for using link-level payment splitting and rendezvous routing, even if a node has only a single channel to the next node.During the email conversation, potential issues with the mechanism described during the spec meeting were also discussed. These issues could violate the wrap-resistance property of the ideal onion routing scheme. Christian Decker suggested rebalancing the D->C->A cycle so that the CD link can pass the payment through, which neither earns nor loses money for C. A proposal was made to use HORNET, which supports rendezvous routing and is formally proven in a model. Furthermore, there was discussion around the concept of link-level payment splitting and re-routing. It was noted that even with a single channel to the next node, it is possible to perform link-level payment splitting/re-routing by routing payments through alternative channels if the primary channel is saturated in favor of the destination. This allows for re-routing or payment splitting over multiple hops.However, in a routing scenario, it is possible that C may not have the information regarding the number of remaining hops between D and the destination. In such cases, C has an alternative available in the form of attempting the routing instead of giving up and earning nothing. Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list discussed several proposals and potential solutions related to payment routing in the Lightning Network.</p>
