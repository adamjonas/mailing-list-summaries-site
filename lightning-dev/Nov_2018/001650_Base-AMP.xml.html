    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Johan Tor√•s Halseth suggests restricting the changes to BOLT11 by having the receiver assume Non-Atomic Multi-Path (NAMP) for incoming payments. However, this would require the receiver to assume NAMP even when the sender is signaling it. The alternative solution proposed is to have a flag both on BOLT11 and inside the onion, which would make it explicitly opt-in for both sides and wouldn't affect existing nodes in any way. This would effectively become a probe for Base AMP, and if a partial payment error occurs, it's because the recipient didn't support Base AMP. Rusty supports this proposal as it seems cleaner.</p>
