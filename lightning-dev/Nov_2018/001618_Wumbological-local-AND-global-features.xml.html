    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent Lightning-dev mailing list, Laolu raised the point that the wumbo bit should also encompass wumbo payments. The purpose of having a wumbo channel is defeated if it does not allow for wumbo payments. If the bit is signalled globally, then it should also signal the willingness of the node to forward larger payments up to their max_htlc limit within the channel_update for that link.Laolu also reviewed a newer section of the specification concerning the optional max_htlc value and noticed an inconsistency. The new section states that the value should be below the max capacity of the channel but makes no reference to the current pre-wumbo _max HTLC limit_. As a result, one may interpret signalling of the optional field as eligibility to route wumbo payments in a pre-wumbo channel world.ZmnSCPxj proposed a solution which includes a local feature bit, `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo`, indicating that the node is willing to wumbo with its counterparty in the connection, and a global feature bit, `option_anyone_can_wumbo`, indicating that the node is willing to wumbo with any node. Rusty Russell suggested renaming `option_anyone_can_wumbo` to `option_wumborama`.</p>
