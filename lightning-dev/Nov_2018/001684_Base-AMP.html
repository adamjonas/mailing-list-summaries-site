    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to a group, ZmnSCPxj proposed using a 2-byte "number of total pieces" for splitting payments. However, he later discovered that this solution would not work well in the case of splitting bills where each payer is unrelated and does not know how the others are paying. This approach would also not be suitable for a dynamic algorithm that greedily tries to pay the whole amount at once, then splits it if it does not fit, with each split also being liable to splitting. While such an algorithm would not know how many splits it will take, it will know the total amount it intends to deliver.</p>
