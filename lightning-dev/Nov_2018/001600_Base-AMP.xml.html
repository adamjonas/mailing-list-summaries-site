    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj made a pull request for Base AMP. He proposed a change regarding `intended_payment_amount` which can be removed since it is unnecessary for both intermediate nodes and the payee node to have it. Rusty suggested sticking with BOLT #4 which requires the following: type: `per_hop`, data of [`8`:`short_channel_id`], [`8`:`amt_to_forward`], and [`4`:`outgoing_cltv_value`]. ZmnSCPxj proposed an even simpler solution where if `amt_to_forward` plus fees charged by this node are greater than the actual incoming HTLC, this is an AMP attempt. If `amt_to_forward` is greater than the incoming HTLC value, this is also considered an AMP attempt. However, an explicit flag is more sensible as it is more explicit. ZmnSCPxj suggests using a new `per_hop_type` or a byte in padding for flags, but notes that either option is fine with him. He proposes that a new `per_hop_type` should have a 2-byte `flags` and a 10-byte `padding` explicitly specced as "MUST be all 0". An explicit flags field would allow delivery of higher-layer application data in each payment.</p>
