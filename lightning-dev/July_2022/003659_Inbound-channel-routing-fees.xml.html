    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion regarding the Lightning Network on Github, the issue of traffic imbalance was brought up. Some nodes receive more traffic than they send, which can cause liquidity issues and failed payments. The current fee structure is designed to incentivize people to open channels to these imbalanced nodes by providing routing fees in exchange for locking funds and paying on-chain fees. However, one participant expressed concern that changing this incentive structure could make the network less reliable. Another participant argued that if merchants charge inbound fees, they may not attract enough liquidity and suggested that setting up a fee-charging gateway with a private channel to the main node accepting payments would be a better solution.</p>
