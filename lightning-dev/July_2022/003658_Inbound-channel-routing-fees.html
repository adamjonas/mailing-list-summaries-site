    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion focuses on the topic of inbound fees in Lightning Network and whether they are necessary or not. The argument is that inbound fees can be a tool for malicious nodes to misbehave and prevent routing through certain channels. However, it is also mentioned that selective failure of HTLCs by malicious nodes can also cause problems. The concept of setting high fees on outbound channels is also discussed, which affects traffic coming from all peers. The idea of compensating for locked up capital in less interesting channels is introduced as a reason for implementing inbound fees. It is argued that lack of inbound fees requires more trust and leads to centralization. Finally, the proposal of making the opener of a channel pay a fee to compensate for risk is suggested as an alternative.</p>
