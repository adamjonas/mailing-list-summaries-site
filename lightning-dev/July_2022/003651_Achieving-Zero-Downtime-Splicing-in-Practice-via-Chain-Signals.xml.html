    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion between Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Rusty Russell revolves around the reliability of signaling a splice in progress during routing. While waiting for reliable gossip is important, it may not be foolproof, and waiting for a certain number of blocks before closing channels can be wishful thinking. Olaoluwa suggests that if a close looks a certain way, it is a splice, and the channel size can be updated accordingly. However, Rusty questions the need to spam the chain and the reliability of waiting for the latest gossip. Instead, he suggests treating every close as signaling "stay tuned for the gossip message" and marking a channel as a zombie if no message is received after two weeks. While an on-chain signal would be helpful, it is not 100% reliable, and using existing methods may be more reliable and simpler.</p>
