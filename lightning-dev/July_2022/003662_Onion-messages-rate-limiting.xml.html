    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Joost Jager raised concerns about the potential for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Jager suggested that the ability to generate spam indefinitely after opening a channel might be a problem. Similarly, if an attacker has enough channels to hit the rate limit on an important connection, they can sustain the attack indefinitely. However, another participant in the conversation, Matt, disagreed with these concerns and argued that backpressure works fine and applies pressure automatically until nodes are appropriately ratelimiting the source of the traffic. Matt also pointed out that lightning ties between nodes are much stronger than ISPs on the internet as you are generally at least loosely trusting your peer with your money, not just your customer's customer's bits.</p>
