        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email exchange revolves around potential design choices for splicing transactions in the Lightning Network. One suggestion is to add a delay between when nodes see a channel closed on chain and when they remove it from their local channel graph. However, this arbitrary delay won't address the issue due to various factors. Instead, relying on the primary splicing signal being sourced from the chain itself is suggested, using options such as reusing anchors.There is also discussion about the reliability of signaling a splice in progress during routing and the potential for lost routing fees in case of communication failure. Waiting for reliable gossip and the appropriate number of blocks before closing channels is also discussed.The move towards taproot/gossip v2 aims to make lightning's on-chain footprint indistinguishable from any other on-chain usage, which runs counter to the proposal of adding an on-chain detectable signal. In the world of blockchain, staying up-to-date with the latest news and updates is important but can be time-consuming and inefficient. Researcher Vlad Zamfir suggests treating every close as signaling "stay tuned for the gossip message." This means that participants can simply wait for a message to come to them instead of actively seeking out updates. If no message is received after two weeks, the channel can be marked as a zombie. While an on-chain signal would be helpful, Zamfir acknowledges that it's not 100% reliable. Therefore, using existing methods may be more reliable and simpler. By adopting this approach, participants can save time and energy while still staying up-to-date on important information in the blockchain community.</p>
