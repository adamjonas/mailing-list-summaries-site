        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network has been a topic of discussion for many researchers and developers, with the rebalancing of the network being one of the main topics. The post questions the benefits of sending cycle transactions to oneself to rebalance the network. It is unclear what benefits are gained from rebalancing. However, there have been many discussions on this topic on the Lightning Network mailing list and other places online. One argument is that by maintaining balance, one is likely to reduce the number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding as a channel is equally likely to be able to carry an HTLC in either direction. In a discussion between Dmytro and Olaoluwa, they argued about whether active rebalancing is necessary in the Lightning Network. According to one participant, rebalancing is not necessary if nodes plan their send and receive activities based on available balances in channels. Additionally, the directionality of payment flows in the network can determine whether passive rebalancing is necessary or not. In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against active rebalancing, the existing literature shows that it's not a new problem and has been explored before.Dmytro Piatkivskyi suggests that a smart fee strategy might be more effective in balancing the network than sending cycle transactions. He also references a paper that states that the distribution of funds in channels does not significantly affect network liquidity. However, Rene Pickhardt argues that balanced channels may increase the probability of finding a working route and suggests Atomic Multipath Payments and splicing as potential solutions. Additionally, routing fees in the Lightning Network would require a new approach to mathematical analysis, according to a 2010 paper.Finally, the privacy requirements of the Lightning network are still uncertain, and the network's routing may become more difficult as it grows.</p>
