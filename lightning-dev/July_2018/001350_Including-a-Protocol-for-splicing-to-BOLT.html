    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about the importance of having a proper proof of payment in a system without intermediaries. Although there is currently a "proof that someone paid", a proper proof would be "proof that Bob paid Carol". The topic of spontaneous payments is also discussed, which is a highly requested feature among users and developers. Dlog based AMPs are suggested as a possible solution to achieving this. Hash-based AMPs may require more interaction and something like zkboo to achieve stronger binding, but they may lose the "one shot" property that dlog based AMPs allow. Meanwhile, the introduction of Schnorr-Eltoonicorn is expected to be a major update that will bring several trade-offs. However, it is believed that everything that can be done with Schnorr can also be done with ECDSA today.The conversation also touches on the importance of splicing, which allows the user to ignore differences between on-chain and off-chain funds and show a single balance for all use-cases. Multi-channel was considered a hack because splicing does not exist, and the implementation of multi-channel is not preferred. AMP is viewed as an important feature, but there are limitations to its current form, and a compromise has to be made. The conversation concludes with Rusty Russell suggesting that with the arrival of Schnorr-Eltoonicorn, it may be possible to have one's cake and eat it too.</p>
