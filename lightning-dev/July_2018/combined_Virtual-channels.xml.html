        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about virtual channels within Lightning Network implementations, Rusty suggests using the BOLT-11 'r' fields to advertise private or virtual channels. Dmytro Piatkivskyi brings up the idea of allowing heterogeneity in LN transactions, which would allow companies to transact with entities they have a trust relationship with. However, source routing could be an issue, and one solution could be advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels to constantly figure out respective balances. The author seeks advice on how to approach a situation involving virtual channels in the Lightning Network. They believe that LN should allow for more heterogeneity and transactions between entities that have a trust relationship. The main issue is source routing, where Alice creates the payment chain, so she needs to be aware of the author's relationship with their trusted contact. One solution proposed is advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels as suggested by Rene. The author acknowledges that using the word 'trust' may be repulsive but points out that it could be applicable in situations where a company runs multiple nodes. The author is asking if there is any way to do this or if there are other solutions.</p>
