        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The post discusses virtual channels in Lightning Network and how they can be used by companies with multiple nodes to transact between them. The author seeks advice on how to approach the situation involving virtual channels where the entities have a trust relationship. They provide an example where Alice wants to send a satoshi to Bob, but the author does not have a channel with Bob. However, the author trusts someone who has a channel with Bob. The main issue here is source routing, where Alice creates the payment chain, so she needs to be aware of the author's relationship with their trusted contact.Rusty suggests that we can use the BOLT-11 'r' fields to advertise private or virtual channels. He also notes that an advertisement of a channel's existence does not require its use and that it is possible to transact without opening a channel by having a trust relationship. Dmytro Piatkivskyi brings up the idea of allowing heterogeneity in LN transactions, which would allow companies to transact with entities they have a trust relationship with.One solution proposed for the source routing issue is advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels to constantly figure out respective balances. The author acknowledges that using the word 'trust' may be repulsive but points out that it could be applicable in situations where a company runs multiple nodes. Overall, the discussion revolves around finding ways to improve virtual channels in Lightning Network to enable seamless transactions between entities that have a trust relationship.</p>
