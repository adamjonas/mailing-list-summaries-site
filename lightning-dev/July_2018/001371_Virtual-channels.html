    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this post is seeking advice on how to approach a situation involving virtual channels in the Lightning Network. They mention that Rene's article [1] discusses virtual channels and how they can be used by companies with multiple nodes to transact between them. However, the author believes that LN should allow for more heterogeneity and transactions between entities that have a trust relationship. They provide an example where they trust someone who has a channel with Bob and Alice wants to send Bob a satoshi. The author receives an HTLC from Alice and gives the image to their trusted contact who creates an HTLC with Bob, which he executes after checking everything is ok. The main issue is source routing. In the given scenario, Alice creates the payment chain, so she needs to be aware of the author's relationship with their trusted contact. One solution proposed is advertising their trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels as suggested by Rene. The author is asking if there is any way to do this or if there are other solutions.The author acknowledges that using the word 'trust' may be repulsive but points out that it could be applicable in situations where a company runs multiple nodes.</p>
