        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Christian Decker and Robert Olsson have been discussing proposals related to Lightning Network. Decker suggests that proposals should be judged independently rather than grouped together for convenience. Rusty proposes adding an optional funding transaction and merkle proof to channel_announce or introducing a new channel_announce_with_proof message. He also suggests tunneling bitcoin block headers through the network, which would benefit lite nodes.The absence of channel capacity in the channel_announcement message is being questioned, leading to low routing success rates, particularly for larger payments. The only way to determine channel capacity is by checking the blockchain which is not feasible for mobile and light wallets. A proposal has been made by Robert Olsson to add an HTLC maximum value to channel_update, along with htlc_minimum_msat. However, Christian believes that it's about adding the total channel capacity to the channel_announcement. This eliminates the need for an on-chain lookup, and since the channel's capacity is fixed for its existence, the announcement is the right place to put it.The discussion revolves around potential issues of abuse and bandwidth in relation to blockchain nodes. One solution proposed is for nodes to discard erroneous messages and broadcast updates wisely instead of after every packet. Christian Decker suggests tracking an internal UTXO set to avoid asking for full blocks from bitcoind to check a channel's capacity. The lack of channel capacity information in the channel_announcement message makes it difficult for mobile and light wallets to determine the capacity of channels. To address this issue, one user suggested appending an htlc_maximum_msat value to the channel_update message, which would show capacity minus fees. Christian responds by saying that he thinks it would be better and more flexible to append a max to channel_update. However, the idea of adding the total channel capacity to channel_announcement is reasonable. The channel's capacity is fixed for the existence of that channel, so it is important to include it in the announcement.</p>
