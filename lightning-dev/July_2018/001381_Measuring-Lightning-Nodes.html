    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Alex Evanovic asked for suggestions on how to measure lightning nodes in their current state. In response, Artem Litvinovich suggested several ways to get information about Lightning Network (LN) nodes and channels. If someone wants to know how many nodes and channels are available on the LN network, they can connect to any LN node and set an initial_routing_sync flag in the init message. This will prompt the peer to send the whole gossip dump containing node and channel info of every public node/channel (sans channel capacities). Alternatively, if someone doesn't want to make anything but simply query their c-lightning node, they can use the listnodes and listchannels commands with lightning-cli. And if someone wants to just get the information without doing anything or running a node, they can look it up on explorer sites such as 1ml dot org. However, there is a small confusion regarding the website name as someone corrected that it is actually 1ml dot com instead of 1ml dot org.</p>
