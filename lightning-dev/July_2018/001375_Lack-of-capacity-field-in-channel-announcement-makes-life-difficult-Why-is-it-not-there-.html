    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made by Robert Olsson to add an HTLC maximum value to channel_update, along with htlc_minimum_msat, which is already present. Christian responds by saying that this isn't about the maximum HTLC value, but rather adding the total channel capacity to the channel_announcement. He believes that it's a reasonable idea as it saves an on-chain lookup and since the channel's capacity is fixed for its existence, the announcement is the right place to put it. This was the main reason for tracking an internal UTXO set to stop asking bitcoind for full blocks just to check a channel's capacity.</p>
