    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On July 22, 2018, René Pickhardt proposed the creation of LIPs or Lightning Network Improvement Proposals. He suggested that they should be placed on the Github Lightning account in a repository called "lips" until it is integrated into the Lightning RFC repo. René created a draft for LIP-0001, which describes the process and is mostly influenced by BIP-0002. The idea behind the proposal is to have a central place where future enhancements for BOLT1.1 can be collected. René suggested watchtowers, autopilot, AMP, splicing, routing protocols, broadcasting past routing statistics, eltoo, among others as potential LIPs.René volunteered to work on a LIP for splicing. However, there was no need for a separate repository for lightning since lightning is already covered by BIPs. Existing BOLTs should be submitted to the BIPs repository too.</p>
