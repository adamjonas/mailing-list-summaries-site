    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A junior developer and Bitcoin user is expressing concern over the use of "SIGHASH_NOINPUT" which could make reuse addresses more dangerous. Donate addresses are often used as reuse addresses, with fans constantly sending Bitcoins to these addresses. If a user imports their address (keys, seeds) to an enabled Bitcoin/LN wallet and signs a transaction using "SIGHASH_NOINPUT", it will immediately disable their donate address, causing future loss of coins, though the input amount is included by the signature. "SIGHASH_NONE" only affects the current coin in a single transaction. However, "SIGHASH_NOINPUT" affects the whole wallet and future coins, and its intention is to be widely used in Bitcoin/LN wallets. The user believes "SIGHASH_NOINPUT" could put many users at risk. Meanwhile, Luke Dashjr does not believe that address reuse should be assumed safe or works. He intends to possibly use "SIGHASH_NOINPUT" for ordinary Bitcoin transactions in a wallet he is writing, which explicitly does not support address reuse.</p>
