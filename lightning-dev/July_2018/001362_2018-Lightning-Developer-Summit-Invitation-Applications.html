    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Lightning Summit is being organized by the people involved in the BOLT process for the last two years. The summit will be held in Adelaide, Australia on November 8-9, and it will set priorities and assess concrete proposals for the 1.1 version of the spec. Anyone who wants to participate can apply on the provided link. However, the organizers are aiming for less than 20 participants to keep it small and focus solely on protocol design. Representatives from lnd, c-lightning, and Eclair projects have already been selected to participate. It is a highly technical event, and the committee members organizing this event are Elizabeth Stark, Pierre-Marie Padiou, Rusty Russell. People looking to build applications or contribute to lightning-related projects will have other opportunities.</p>
