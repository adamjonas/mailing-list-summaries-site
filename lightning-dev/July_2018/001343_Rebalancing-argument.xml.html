    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on whether active rebalancing is necessary in the Lightning Network (LN) has been ongoing. According to a developer who attended a meetup with cdecker, active rebalancing becomes necessary when a node wishes to receive a payment but the channels they have available do not have enough capacity. Pre-AMP, active rebalancing was usually necessary to ensure that nodes could receive payments, but post-AMP, multi-path payments make it less necessary. Passive rebalancing, which involves maintaining an equilibrium state among the available balances of channels, can also help reduce the number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding. However, the directionality of payment flows in the network can determine whether passive rebalancing is necessary or not. In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against active rebalancing, the existing literature shows that it's not a new problem and has been explored before.</p>
