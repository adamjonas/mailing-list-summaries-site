        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>René Pickhardt, a contributor to the Lightning Network, proposed the creation of Lightning Network Improvement Proposals (LIPs) similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). He suggests that these proposals be placed in a new repository called lips within the github.com/lightning account or within the lightning rfc repo. The purpose of this proposal is to have a centralized location for future enhancements for BOLT 1.1, the current Lightning Network protocol. Potential LIPs could include watchtowers, autopilot, AMP, splicing, routing protocols, broadcasting past routing statistics, eltoo, and more. To address concerns about the process of creating, modifying, and drafting BOLT documents, Laolu suggested announcing before running an experiment with a new feature bit. A unique identifier for the feature, such as a hash of the feature name, can be used to avoid requiring centralized number assignment. To address these concerns, a rough draft of the idea for experimental features protocol has been shared. This protocol is intended for testing protocol features that are not necessarily intended to become standard BOLTs. By moving all experimental features to a new message where they are wrapped in a unique feature name, this eradicates the chance of conflicting implementations.In addition, there is a suggestion to start having Lightning Network Improvement Proposals (LIPs) placed on the github.com/lightning account in a repo called lips, which would fill the gap between distributed ideas within the community and a centralized place to collect future enhancements for BOLT1.1. Some potential LIPs could include Watchtowers, Autopilot, AMP, Splicing, Routing Protocols, Broadcasting past Routing statistics, eltoo, and more. René Pickhardt volunteered to work on a LIP for Splicing. However, another member of the community pointed out that BOLTs already function as improvement proposals and are historically proposed initially as issues or PRs when ultimately accepted.The email thread also discusses the proposal for an experimental features protocol. The proposed protocol includes lightning base protocol messages, general experiment messages, and an overview. The experiment message has a unique ID for each feature supported. A sending node must send the `init_experiments` message before any other `experiment` message for each connection. The receiving node should enable the feature for communication with this peer. Overall, the email thread discusses various concerns and proposals for improving the process of creating, modifying, and drafting BOLT documents, including addressing collisions in feature bit assignments, proposing an experimental features protocol, and suggesting a central repository for collecting future enhancements for BOLT 1.1. There are also some TODOs, including defining gossip/query messages related to nodes/channels that support features by experiment_hash_name.</p>
