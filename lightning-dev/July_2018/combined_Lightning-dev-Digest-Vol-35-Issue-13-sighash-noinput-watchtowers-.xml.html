        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread in question discusses the use of sighash_noinput, an application that reduces the number of stored signatures. However, there is concern about the potential trade-off of privacy when using this method for watchtowers, as it reveals which states are related. Eltoo is mentioned as a solution to this problem, but it requires SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which means that only the latest transaction is needed instead of a penalty tx for every state change. The txid_half + encrypted blob model ensures that no information is learned about each state and how they relate unless a revocation must happen, but this method does not scale well. With the reuse of signatures for multiple states with sighash_noinput, there is a question of how to minimize information being disclosed to third parties. Encryption using the txid is suggested as a possible solution, although no full design has been done yet.A twist is that the watchtower may need to consider transactions that have already been spent by one or a chain of SIGHASH_NOINPUT transactions, but this is considered easy. In response to these concerns, Rusty Russell suggests that a wallet should never create a SIGHASH_NOINPUT to spend its own UTXOs, as it is only useful for smart contracts with unique conditions such as lightning.</p>
