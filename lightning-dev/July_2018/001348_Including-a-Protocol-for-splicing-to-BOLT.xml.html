    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network developers are discussing the priorities for their network improvements. Multipath routing is a priority, but splicing is just as important since it allows users to ignore the differences between on-chain and off-chain funds. However, multi-channel was a hack because splicing doesn't exist yet, and implementing multipath routing without splicing would be difficult. AMP (Atomic Multi-Path payments) is also important, but it's a nasty compromise with current limitations. The Lightning Network developers hope to have their cake and eat it too with Scnorr-Eltoonicorn, which will be a big update switching to dlog based HTLCs. This update may cause them to lose proof-of-payment, which is vital in a system without intermediaries. Therefore, they need to decide what the lesser evil is.</p>
