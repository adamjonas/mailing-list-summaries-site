    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Alex is seeking advice on how to measure lightning nodes in their current state. The context of the request is not clear, but it is likely related to assessing the performance or health of these nodes. No further information has been provided to suggest whether Alex is referring specifically to lightning network nodes or some other type of lightning node.Without additional context, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to Alex's question. However, there are several tools and methods available for measuring lightning network performance and identifying potential issues. These include Lightning Labs' LND Dashboard and Node Launcher, as well as third-party solutions such as RTL and ThunderHub. In addition to these monitoring tools, it may also be helpful to analyze the network traffic and node behavior using packet sniffing or other network analysis techniques. This can provide insights into the data being transmitted between nodes and help identify any bottlenecks or other network issues that may be impacting performance.Overall, accurately measuring the performance of lightning nodes requires a combination of tools, analysis techniques, and expertise in the lightning network protocol. With the right approach, however, it is possible to gain a detailed understanding of the health and performance of these nodes and take steps to optimize their operation.</p>
