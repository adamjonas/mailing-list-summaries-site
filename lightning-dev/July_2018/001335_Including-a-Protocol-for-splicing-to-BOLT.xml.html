    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the difficulties of extending the gossip protocol for Lightning Network. If channel_announce is extended, it won't propagate through old nodes until the new channel is 6 deep and it will be wasted space once the splice is old news. Similarly, if channel_update is extended, it won't propagate once the new spend is seen on the bitcoin network. A new message type won't propagate at all through old nodes. Instead, a new `channel_announce_reopen` could inform everyone that an old scid will eventually become a new scid. The channel is closed for some blocks, but a new channel between the two nodes is then announced. The priority should be given to AMP which retains proper ZKCP, and with AMP, size of channels is less important. On-to-offchain and off-to-onchain bridges form a different layer and moves complexity from the Lightning protocol to a different "bridge" layer, making dual-funding channels less necessary.</p>
