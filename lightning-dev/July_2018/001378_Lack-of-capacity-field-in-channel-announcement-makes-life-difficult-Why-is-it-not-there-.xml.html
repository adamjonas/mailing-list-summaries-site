    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian Decker responded to Robert Olsson's suggestion of adding a maximum HTLC value field, stating that he thinks it would be better and more flexible to append a max to channel_update. However, the idea of adding the total channel capacity to channel_announcement is reasonable as it allows them to save an on-chain lookup and the announcement is exactly the right place to put it. Christian agrees with the addition but believes it should get its own proposal and discussion. The channel's capacity is fixed for the existence of that channel, so it is important to include it in the announcement.</p>
