    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Joost Jager and Peter Todd regarding sender authentication in Lightning, Jager suggested using a solution that exists completely within the protocol without using an additional channel. Todd argued that there's no reason to use diffie-hellman once a secure channel is established as providing the sender with payment information is sufficient for authentication. Todd also warned against creating the ability to prove to a third party who made a particular payment, citing potential issues in cases like government raids. While routing nodes learn pre-image hash as well, this is solved by the payment secret that is also part of the invoice.</p>
