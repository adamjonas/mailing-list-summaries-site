    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Bastien TEINTURIER raised concerns about the "toxic waste" issue that arises with HTLCs in Bitcoin. This issue is due to committing to the payment_hash directly inside the transaction scripts, which requires remembering all payment_hashes seen to recreate the scripts and spend the outputs even if they are revoked. In response to a suggestion regarding dust and local_anchor, it was indicated that using revkey would prevent bumping the current remote commitment if it appears on-chain as the private revkey is not yet known for the latest commitment. However, if someone else's commitment is being bumped, the remote_anchor they provided will be used instead of the local_anchor.</p>
