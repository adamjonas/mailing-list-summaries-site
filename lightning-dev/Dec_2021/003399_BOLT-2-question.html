    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the post has a question about BOLT #2 and specifically what it means to "fail the channel". They have provided an excerpt from the section for "update_add_htlc," which outlines four scenarios where a node "SHOULD fail the channel". The first scenario involves receiving an amount_msat equal to 0 or less than its own htlc_minimum_msat. The second scenario involves receiving an amount_msat that the sending node cannot afford at the current feerate_per_kw while maintaining its channel reserve and any to_local_anchor and to_remote_anchor costs. The third scenario is when the sending node adds more than the receiver max_accepted_htlcs HTLCs to its local commitment transaction or adds more than the receiver max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat worth of offered HTLCs to its local commitment transaction. Finally, the fourth scenario is when the sending node sets cltv_expiry to greater or equal to 500000000. The author asks whether failing the channel means closing the channel (unilaterally or mutually) or ending the TCP connection or something else entirely.</p>
