        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A temporary solution for adding identification information in BOLT11 payment requests was suggested in a discussion between fiatjaf, Peter Todd, and Joost Jager. The solution can be found in the lnurl-rfc repository and involves providing a lone pubkey, a domain-specific pubkey along with a signature of a challenge provided by the receiver, or an unauthenticated name or email within the BOLT11 payment request using the 'h' tag. However, concerns were raised about the privacy implications of using signatures in payment requests as they could allow the receiver to prove to a third party that the payment was made. In terms of sender authentication in Lightning, Peter Todd argued that diffie-hellman is unnecessary once a secure channel is established as providing the sender with payment information is sufficient for authentication. He also warned against creating the ability to prove to a third party who made a particular payment, citing potential issues in cases like government raids. Joost Jager proposed deriving a shared secret using ECDH with the sender and receiver node keys and attaching a custom record to the payment containing the sender node key and an HMAC of the payment hash using the shared secret as a key as an alternative approach to sender authentication. While sender authentication is not a requirement in the Lightning network, it may be useful in some cases such as chat over lightning or donation payments where a donor may want to reveal themselves. An ECDSA signature or deriving a shared secret using ECDH with the sender and receiver node keys and attaching a custom record to the payment were suggested as ways of implementing opt-in sender authentication. Technical opinions are being sought on the best way to implement sender authentication while considering cryptographic authentication and non-repudiation issues.</p>
