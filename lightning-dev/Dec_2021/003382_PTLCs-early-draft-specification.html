    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj is discussing a new feature being added to the Lightning Network which requires an additional round-trip for certain transactions. The example given shows that if A wants to sign a new commitment, she cannot immediately send it to B as B can broadcast this new commitment and A would not be able to claim PTLC_BA from B's new commitment since she wouldn't have B's signature for the new PTLC-remote-success transaction. Thus, B needs to send a new message `remote_ptlcs_signed` to A containing his adaptor signatures for the PTLC-remote-success transactions that would spend B's future commitment before A can safely send her `commitment_signed`. Similarly, A must send `remote_ptlcs_signed` to B before B can send its `commitment_signed`. ZmnSCPxj also discusses some alternatives such as `SIGHASH_NONE | SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, like fast-forwards which avoids these changes as it does not change commitment transactions on the payment-forwarding path.</p>
