        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin has proposed a rule to allow 0 value outputs, which must be used as intermediate outputs and spent by another transaction in order for the creating transaction to be in the mempool. The policy would require the parent to have a higher feerate after CPFP'ing the parent than the parent alone, allowing 0 value outputs to be used for Anchor Outputs while avoiding pinning and preventing their proliferation. To discourage their use, it is suggested to incentivize miners and users to save the transaction spending the 0 value output or set a flag on the UTXO to expire if not used in the block it was created. Another solution proposed is to have 0 value outputs present only for attaching fees in the mempool and treating them like an op_return otherwise, achieved through two cases: one bare segwit version and one equivalent to taproot. Ruben and Jeremy also discussed the possibility of 0 sat outputs entering the mempool and not being spent. While Jeremy argued that this is not a big problem, Ruben added that it is possible for a user to unintentionally behave in a way that causes the 0 sat output to not be spent. He proposed the idea of a UTXO with drop semantics, which would expire and become unspendable if not spent in the block it was created. Two cases could be added for this: a bare segwit version and one equivalent to Taproot. While Ruben acknowledged the potential benefits of this solution, he noted that it may require a consensus change.Furthermore, the email thread discusses the issue of Decker Channels and how anchor outputs can be problematic due to RBF pinning and at-dust outputs. A congestion-control tree setup can be used to avoid needing N of them, where log(n) data is needed for one bumper and 1.25x the data if all N want to bump. Since these could be chains of IUTXO, they don't need to carry any weight directly. The carve-out would just be to ensure that CPFP 0 values are known how to be spent. Overall, the focus should be on making 0 value outputs inconvenient enough to discourage their use and prevent bloat in the mempool.</p>
