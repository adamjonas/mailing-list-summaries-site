    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange, Joost argued that adding a choice of seconds expectation to the user interface (UI) for Lightning payments would not make for a great user experience. Instead, he suggested giving users an estimate of fees necessary to succeed within a reasonable time and providing an option to optimize for fees only if they are cheap and the user doesn't care about payment success. Stefan disagreed with this approach, stating that in the current state of Lightning, some kind of control is needed to bridge the gap between fast and cheap payments. He proposed a checkbox as a minimalistic control lever. The two debated whether users would prefer paying a higher fee for a faster payment or a lower fee for a longer wait time.</p>
