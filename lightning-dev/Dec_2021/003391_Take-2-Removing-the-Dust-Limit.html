    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the issue of 0 value outputs and their potential impact on the Bitcoin mempool. The concern is not necessarily if a 0 value output enters the mempool, but rather if it is never spent. However, there are steps that can be taken to prevent this from happening, such as incentivizing miners and users to save the transaction spending the 0 value output, or setting a flag on the UTXO so that it expires and can never be spent if not used in the block it was created. Another solution proposed is to have 0 value outputs present only for attaching fees in the mempool and treating them like an op_return otherwise. This could be achieved through two cases: one bare segwit version and one equivalent to taproot. While a consensus change involving sponsors may make more sense, expiring utxos would be simpler and less disruptive to the tx-graph validation process. Overall, the focus should be on making 0 value outputs inconvenient enough to discourage their use.</p>
