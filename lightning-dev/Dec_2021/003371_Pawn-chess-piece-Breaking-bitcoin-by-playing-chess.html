    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the provided context discusses a project that involves testing Bitcoin transactions while also having fun and increasing demand for block space. The primary goal is to create an app for developers to play chess, with friendly competitions and opportunities to learn and share new things. However, if chess does not appeal, any two-player game that can be played patiently over a few hours or days could be used instead. The author notes that zero fee transactions no longer work, and all transactions will require fees long-term, with a minimum fee rate of 1 sat/vbyte. OP_RETURN is excluded from the UTXO set, but many projects still use it. The author will not be working on this project as they are busy with another project and have recently begun contributing to Wasabi.</p>
