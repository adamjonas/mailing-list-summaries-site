    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Earlier this year, Ryan emailed the Lightning mailing list about bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposals (bLIPs) as a way to help standardize community-driven app layer and protocol extension development. The first two bLIPs specifying the process have been merged and they are ready to start receiving proposals. Ryan mentioned several example proposals he has his eyes on like Val's Keysend bLIP, Sphinx team's LUMO messaging format, Satoshi's Stream's TLV registry, Lightning Node Connect, niftynei's accounting standardization work, Impervious's LN-native communications work, and LND's Static Channel Backup system. A bLIP is a design document that provides information to the Lightning community or describes a new feature for the Lightning Network. It should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. Importantly, if a feature is intended to become universal or near-universal, it must be a BOLT. Because of this distinction, the bLIP editors do not pass judgment on bLIPs but only monitor bLIP changes and update bLIP headers as appropriate. As long as one checks the mailing list to ensure nobody has made a similar proposal before, fills out the required sections specified in bLIP-0001, and reserves the required feature bit, message type, or TLV in the bLIP-0002 registry, they are more than happy to merge proposals into the repo. Interested individuals can reach out to Ryan if they want help writing a bLIP.</p>
