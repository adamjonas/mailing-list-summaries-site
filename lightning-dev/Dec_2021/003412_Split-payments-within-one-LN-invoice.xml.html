    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between William Casarin and Ronan McGovern, they discussed the possibility of developing a protocol for splitting Lightning Network payments. However, Casarin noted that this is typically done at the application level. The Fountain podcasting app uses this approach, but handling partially failed payments can be tricky. Casarin suggested trying with exponential backoff until the payment completes for all parties. Designing a protocol-level solution would require handling complex business logic. Currently, it's reasonable to handle this at the application level, but standard protocols might be useful in the future.</p>
