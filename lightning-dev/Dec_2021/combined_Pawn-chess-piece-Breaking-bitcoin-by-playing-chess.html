        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email begins with an inquiry about the necessary email address to obtain approval or permission for opening and closing lightning network channels or performing OP_RETURN transactions with bitcoin. The sender emphasizes that frivolous use of block space is not encouraged, using the example of writing chess moves on a dollar bill and sending it to friends. They provide two related links: one for Koala Studio's failed attempt to play chess on LN in 2019 which shut down in August, and another for Etleneum, a platform that still offers chess but works differently. The sender states that their primary goal with this project may be different and focused on testing Bitcoin transactions, while the secondary goal is to have fun and contribute to increasing demand for block space. They suggest that if chess sounds boring, it can be replaced with any two-player game that can be played patiently over a few hours or days. The sender also notes that zero fee transactions no longer work and all transactions will require fees long-term. They mention that OP_RETURN is excluded from the UTXO set, but many projects still use it. The email is signed by Lord His Excellency James HRMH of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire, along with Mr. Damian A. James Williamson from Willtech. The email includes links to various websites such as willtech.com.au, go-overt.com, and duigco.org. Contact information for the sender is provided. The email concludes by stating that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered.The email references a GitHub link that provides information on a project involving playing chess using Bitcoin transactions. The primary goal of the project is to test Bitcoin transactions, while the secondary goal is to contribute to increasing demand for block space while having fun. The email mentions that zero fee transactions are no longer functional and all transactions must pay fees that are required long term. The sender suggests that chess can be replaced with any two-player game that can be played over a few hours or days. The email ends with the sender's signature and contact information.The author of the provided context discusses a project that involves testing Bitcoin transactions while also having fun and increasing demand for block space. The primary goal is to create an app for developers to play chess, with friendly competitions and opportunities to learn and share new things. However, if chess does not appeal, any two-player game that can be played patiently over a few hours or days could be used instead. The author notes that zero fee transactions no longer work, and all transactions will require fees long-term, with a minimum fee rate of 1 sat/vbyte. OP_RETURN is excluded from the UTXO set, but many projects still use it. The author will not be working on this project as they are busy with another project and have recently begun contributing to Wasabi.</p>
