        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email is focused on a project that aims to test Bitcoin transactions while having fun and increasing demand for block space. The author's primary goal is to develop an app for developers to play chess, but if chess is not appealing, any two-player game can be used instead. The email notes that zero fee transactions are no longer viable, and all transactions require fees long-term. OP_RETURN is excluded from the UTXO set, but many projects still use it. The email emphasizes that frivolous use of block space is not encouraged.The email is signed by Lord His Excellency James HRMH of Hougun Manor & Glencoe & British Empire, along with Mr. Damian A. James Williamson from Willtech. The email contains links to various websites, including willtech.com.au, go-overt.com, and duigco.org. Contact information for the sender is also provided. The email concludes by stating that it does not constitute general advice and should be disregarded if misdelivered. Furthermore, the email references a GitHub link that provides information on a project involving playing chess using Bitcoin transactions. The project's primary goal is to test Bitcoin transactions, but its secondary goal is to contribute to increasing demand for block space while having fun. The email notes that zero fee transactions no longer work and that all transactions must pay fees that are required long term. The email suggests that chess could be replaced with any two-player game that can be played over a few hours or days. The author will not be working on this project as they are busy with another project and have recently begun contributing to Wasabi.</p>
