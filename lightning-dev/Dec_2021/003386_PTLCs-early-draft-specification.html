    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on Lightning-dev, ZmnSCPxj stated that fast-forwards could be an alternative to updating the commitment transactions on the payment-forwarding path. However, if two PTLCs exist between parties A and B, and A wants to update the commitment transaction, she needs to follow several steps, including producing a signature for B to spend the funding tx and receiving an adaptor signature from B, which can only be done after B has received a signature from A. This creates a problem where previous adaptor signatures would be invalidated, even if the B->A PTLC conditional on Y is within a fast-forward child-transaction. In this case, any way of spending without an adaptor sig would cause B to lose funds. The problem would persist regardless of whether the commitment transaction that A and B will publish is the same or different. The author suggests doing a synchronous update of commitments to the channel state, which involves half a round-trip compared to the current protocol. The timings change so that Bob can use the new commitment after 1.5 round-trips and Alice can use the new commitment after 1 round-trip. Making the funding tx a musig setup would mean supplying 64B of musig2 nonces along with the "adaptor sigs" in one direction.However, the same protocol should work fine with the revocable signatures on a single tx approach as well. Fast forwards would reduce the 2 round-trip protocol to update the state commitment to a 0.5 round-trip update, reducing latency when forwarding by the same amount as before (1.5 round-trips to 0.5 round-trips).</p>
