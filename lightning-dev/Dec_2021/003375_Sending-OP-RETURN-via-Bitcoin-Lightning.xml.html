    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the use of OP_RETURN to create and trade NFTs on Bitcoin. The possibility of making transactions via Lightning with this opcode is explored, including whether it could be included in a channel's opening or closing transaction and whether it could be divisible. While OP_RETURNs do not have ownership according to the Bitcoin network, it is possible to define a protocol that associates them with ownership and allows ownership to be transferred via Lightning by sending associated currency. However, such a protocol layer would need to store and read all Bitcoin transactions and those involving the node's channels as well as those with the OP_RETURN. For more information on this topic, the RGB website is recommended.</p>
