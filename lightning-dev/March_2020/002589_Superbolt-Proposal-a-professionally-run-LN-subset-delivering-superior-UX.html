    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses ways to ensure usability and decentralization of the network, particularly regarding the SBN (Submarine Swap Network). One suggestion is to limit the maximum node size with enforced minimum liquidity requirements per channel. Another proposal is to use OpenTimeStamps for self-attestation, which has a low risk of being coordinated against by an attacker. However, the risk of a minority OTS-server censoring specific nodes remains a possibility. Additionally, proof-of-uptime may not be enough to ensure node correct behavior since it only measures uptime. The issue is presented in the fable of the rat-tail program, where measuring the number of rat tails shown does not necessarily lead to the reduction of rats in the city. Finally, there are suggestions to make proof-of-uptime more expensive and to require groups of independent citizens to put a fund in a k-of-n address and continuously spend that address to themselves on every block, with the proof-of-uptimes of the group embedded in a Merkle tree committed to in the `R` of the signature.</p>
