        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email conversation on the Lightning-dev mailing list is about the construction of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) in the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Subhra Mazumdar asks why multiple HTLCs are needed for a simple transfer of funds from A to B when one should suffice. LL responds that punishment cannot be enforced in an HTLC from A->B->C and shares a link to a relevant document on atomic swaps. The terms of the HTLC itself are proposed as a way to enforce penalties on the counterparty to prevent griefing attacks, with the HTLC output following either of two paths. However, the problem identified is that this approach doesn't work across multiple hops, only for the final hop. The paper on fair atomic swaps is shared as a reference. Finally, Subhra raises a question on whether imposing penalties will lead to a spool out of penalties along the path of the transaction. Lloyd responds that it's only fair if both penalties are set up at the same time.</p>
