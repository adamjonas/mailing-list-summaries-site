    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal to split the network into a central network of specially-chosen nodes surrounded by second-class and third-class nodes is criticized as disturbing. The maximum node capitalization limit could be worked around by running multiple virtual nodes, so it is suggested that such limits not be imposed. Disallowing Tor .onion addresses would also be bad. In terms of attestation, there are questions about how SBN would be bootstrapped, who are the first members, and how "random selection" works. To attest to uptime, a censorship-free way is proposed using OpenTimeStamps. Nodes that want to declare themselves as members of SBN sign the current block and put their signatures in OpenTimeStamps for the next block. To be accepted as an SBN member, a node needs to show proof of liquidity and high uptime by giving proofs to anyone who asks. However, there are concerns about the risk of attacks on OpenTimeStamps server.</p>
