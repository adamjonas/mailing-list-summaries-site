    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Bastien Teinturier and Rusty are discussing the possible use of additive tweaks in a cryptographic protocol which could potentially be faster. The proposed change involves replacing a multiplication operation with an addition operation in a specific step of the protocol. While multiplication is known to be secure, it is not clear whether addition would offer the same level of security. However, Rusty agrees to have a real crypto expert review the proposal to ensure its security. If additive tweaks were used, it would be possible to use x-only public keys, which may save some space. Rusty confirms that it is indeed trivial to switch to x-only public keys, but they may not provide significant savings since they are not stored on-chain. Overall, the discussion centers around making the cryptographic protocol faster and more efficient without sacrificing security.</p>
