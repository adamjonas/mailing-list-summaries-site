        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Lightning Labs has launched Lightning Pool, a new system that allows users to buy and sell "channel leases" that package up inbound liquidity for a fixed duration. The system builds on earlier ideas of creating a market for dual-funding channels for the network. Live testnet+mainnet markets have been released giving routing nodes a new stable revenue source, and allowing those who need inbound to bootstrap their new Lightning Service in a new automated way. The first alpha release includes limits/simplifications, and future iterations will implement streaming interest payments and side-car channels among other things.The author proposes a new idea for leased channels to improve risk-sharing and system health by charging 0 fees initially and then setting a nonzero channel feerate once the "should" fee matches the original lease cost. However, enforcing this is difficult since channel updates are unilateral and the lessee cannot afford to close the channel it leased if the lessor sets a nonzero feerate ahead of time. Additionally, the author notes that if all onchain UTXOs were signed with n-of-n, there would be no need for a fixed orchestrator, as all n participants would cooperatively act as an orchestrator. The writer responds to a set of questions regarding Loop and Pool client/server protocol, channel leasing, and orchestrator functionality. While long-form documentation on the client/server protocol has not yet been written, the current client/server protocol can be found in a set of protobufs listed at the provided link. In regards to channel leasing, the writer agrees with the idea that the purchaser of a lease should be able to receive a fee rate guarantee along with channel lifetime enforcement. The protocol may need to be extended to allow nodes to advertise certain pair-wise channel updates that are only valid if both sides sign off on each other's advertisements. Regarding orchestrator functionality, the writer notes that if all onchain UTXOs were signed with n-of-n, all n participants would cooperatively act as an orchestrator. In a recent conversation, participants discussed the possibility of charging 0 fees for initially leased channels. However, this idea raised concerns about enforcing such a policy and ensuring that both parties sign off on each other's advertisements. To address these issues, the protocol may need to be extended to allow nodes to advertise certain pair-wise channel updates only valid if both sides sign off on them. Lightning Pool can use a node rating system to protect lease buyers from nodes that ramp up their fees after selling a lease. Effective utilization of the leased capital is another factor to consider. In rebalancing away incoming capacity, the channel lessor pays the lessee the forwarding fee and creates incoming capacity on another channel of the lessee.</p>
