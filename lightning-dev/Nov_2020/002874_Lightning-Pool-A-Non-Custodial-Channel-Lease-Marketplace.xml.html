    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Lightning Labs has released a new system called Lightning Pool, which focuses on current uni-directional channels and allows users to buy and sell "channel leases" that package up inbound liquidity for a fixed duration. This concept builds on earlier ideas concerning creating a market for dual-funding channels for the network. The white paper provides a deeper understanding of the system's architecture. Live testnet+mainnet markets were also released, giving routing nodes a new stable revenue source and allowing those who need inbound to bootstrap their new Lightning Service in a new automated way. This is just the first alpha release with limits/simplifications, and future iterations will implement streaming interest payments and side-car channels among other things.</p>
