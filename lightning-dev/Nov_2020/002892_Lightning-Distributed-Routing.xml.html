    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>João Valente has come up with a new concept for routing in the lightning network. The concept involves nodes utilizing information on the distribution of funds in their channels to maximize the probability of success for a payment. Each node shares this information with its neighbors through a routing table, updating it periodically as new tables are received. These tables associate destination addresses with the next hop in the maximum capacity path to reach them.When a new payment is made, a payment probe is forwarded by the payer and collected along the way by every node in the path until it reaches the payee who returns it to the payer. This knowledge can then be confidently used by the payer to route LN payments through the discovered path.João has written a 10-page paper on the subject and is seeking feedback, which can be found at the provided link.</p>
