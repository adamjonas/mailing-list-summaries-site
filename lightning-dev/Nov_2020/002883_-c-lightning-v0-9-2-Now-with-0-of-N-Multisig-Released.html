    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The latest release of c-lightning, version 0.9.2, introduces new features such as CLI-level notifications, better channel state reporting, and stable plugin-hook call ordering. Additionally, the release notes highlight that as of this version, c-lightning-generated PSBTs are only considered valid by bitcoind v0.20.1 and above. Users can now track channel closure rationales, receive CLI/RPC notifications for slow closes, and set a commitment fee rate on the multifundchannel command. Furthermore, two new commands have been added to hsmtool, generatehsm and dumponchaindescriptors, allowing users to create an HSM hsm_secret from a BIP39 pass phrase and output the xpub for the HD wallet master key. For the network, c-lightning no longer supports receiving full gossip from ancient LND nodes and has fixed the re-transmission order of multiple new HTLCS which was causing channel closures with LND. Developers will benefit from plugin hook call ordering, pyln-client handling and sending RPC command notifications, and a pure python implementation of the sphinx onion creation and processing in pyln-proto. Moreover, PostgresSQL key-value DSNs are now supported and the plugin hook htlc_accepted can return a custom failure_onion. Finally, the release notes express gratitude towards contributors and bug reporters, including 4 first-time contributors.</p>
