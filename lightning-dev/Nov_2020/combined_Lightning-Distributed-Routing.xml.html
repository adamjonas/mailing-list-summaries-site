        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>An academic paper on routing in the Lightning Network has received feedback from a reviewer suggesting that nodes could cheat and share biased or invalid information to attract more payments and collect more fees, putting honest routing nodes out of business. The author proposes changing the way nodes choose the next best hop for a certain destination to diminish this incentive. They suggest randomizing the best next hop from the group of next hops for that destination where the maximum volume allowed is higher than the payment's volume. In addition, the author discusses how dishonest nodes could fake competing routes within the capacity range provided by honest nodes, stealing routing paths that would otherwise belong to them.There is a discussion about the `feeadjuster` plugin for C-Lightning and its similarities to LDR in terms of allowing for better routes by signaling channel balance availability. However, LDR goes one step further by sharing channel balance information explicitly. ZmnSCPxj believes that LDR may have a performance edge due to its ability to share more information. They also discuss the implementation of an LN overlay network and how it could work without a spec change. João Valente responds to the feedback from ZmnSCPxj regarding the Lightning Dynamic Routing (LDR) protocol. He shares his extended version of the paper defining the new specification and early beginnings of the LDR-spec compliant software targeting lnd and bitcoind.João Valente has come up with a new concept for routing in the lightning network that uses information nodes have on the distribution of funds in their channels to maximize the probability of success for a payment. Each node shares this information with its neighbors through a routing table, updating it periodically as new tables are received. When a new payment is made, a payment probe is forwarded by the payer and collected along the way by every node in the path until it reaches the payee who returns it to the payer. This knowledge can then be confidently used by the payer to route LN payments through the discovered path. However, concerns are raised about nodes gossiping biased or invalid information to their peers to attract more payments through their nodes. In conclusion, the Lightning Network is constantly evolving as researchers and developers work to improve its efficiency and security. The proposed changes, such as randomizing the best next hop for a certain destination and creating an LDR overlay network, aim to address issues such as cheating nodes and improve routing by signaling channel balance availability. João Valente's new concept for routing in the lightning network has the potential to maximize the probability of success for a payment, but concerns about dishonest nodes need to be addressed. Feedback from other experts in the field is crucial in developing and refining these proposals.</p>
