        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network has developed a 2-of-3 party escrow system that allows for a third-party mediator to verify payment for goods and services without being a custodian for any funds. The system requires two parties to agree on the transaction before it is fulfilled, with each hop in the payment requiring the 2-of-3 condition and long timeouts for security and enough time for the escrow service. The sender and receiver can authorise payment in most cases where there is cooperation, but the escrow is only contacted if there is non-cooperation. From an inter-node transport perspective, all that matters is how many values per contract, with the sender and receiver agreeing on an escrow agent and communication with them. The proposed HTLC wire message determines the type of resolution states, including recipient paid, sender refunded via timeout, and payment immediately cancelled with sender refunded. The author congratulated Tadge, Laolu, and Joseph for their work on Lightning and plans to wade through this week and try to create a list of wire protocol differences to get closer to a final version.</p>
