        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In recent news, a new scala implementation of "deployable lightning" has been released on Github by ACINQ. The implementation is designed to have an actor per lightning channel and keep everything non-blocking, making it fully compatible with Rusty&aj's implementation. It uses the same protobuf messages and a similar state machine. There is also some prototyping on the soon-to-be-replaced onion routing. Earlier today, the -wizards IRC channel revealed two repositories that Bryan had not reviewed for quality, security or functionality. The repositories are <a href="https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd">https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion">https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion</a>. Additionally, Bryan provided links to other git repositories with related work such as <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning">https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork">https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork</a>. However, he has not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security, or functionality. Bryan's contact details were also included in the context: <a href="http://heybryan.org/">http://heybryan.org/</a> and 1 512 203 0507. It is important to note that Pierre expressed his excitement for an agreement on the wire protocol.</p>
