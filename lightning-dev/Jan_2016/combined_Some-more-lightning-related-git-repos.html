        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ACINQ has released a new scala implementation of "deployable lightning" on Github. The implementation aims to have an actor per lightning channel, ensuring non-blocking operations and compatibility with Rusty&aj's implementation. It utilizes the same protobuf messages and a similar state machine. ACINQ has also conducted prototyping on onion routing, which is soon to be replaced.On the Lightning-dev mailing list, Bryan Bishop shared several related git repositories. These include lnd, lightning-onion, lightning, and thundernetwork. However, it should be noted that Bryan has not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security, or functionality.Furthermore, two repositories were discovered in the -wizards IRC channel today, which Bryan had not reviewed for quality, security, or functionality. These repositories are <a href="https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd">https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion">https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion</a>. Additionally, Bryan provided links to other git repositories with related work, such as <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning">https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork">https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork</a>.
