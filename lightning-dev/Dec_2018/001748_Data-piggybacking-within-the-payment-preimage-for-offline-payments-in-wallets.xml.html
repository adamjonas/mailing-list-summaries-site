    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj proposes a piggybacking scheme for vending machines and toll booths. This scheme would allow the vending machine to only send the product or service ID to the remote Lightning Network Node, while the price can be adjusted in real time. The concern is raised about selling products with widely fluctuating BTC value. However, ZmnSCPxj states that they sell products with fixed BTC value and because BTC is deflationary, BTC value of the product will never change. The technician is still required to periodically check the vending machines for mechanical damage or attempts to pay via crowbar. This way, invoices can be replenished with up-to-date prices ensuring limited risk. Static QR codes are deemed unimportant as long as the invoice can be generated at the vending machine and a QR code is shown to pay and claim the product.</p>
