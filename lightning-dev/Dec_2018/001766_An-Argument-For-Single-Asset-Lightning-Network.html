    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer is discussing the potential for a decentralized exchange system and how it compares to the current centralized exchanges. They acknowledge that the trusted third party in a decentralized system may charge high fees, but the proposal is still an improvement over the current situation. The writer argues that their proposal is more competitive because trust requirements are lower, allowing smaller companies to participate, and users can easily switch between different RM parties. They also note that the potential damage that an RM can do to trading parties is less than what a centralized exchange can do by stealing deposited funds. The writer suggests the possibility of punishing misbehaving RMs but doubts its feasibility.</p>
