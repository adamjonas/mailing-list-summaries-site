        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Matt Corallo, a proponent of Lightning development updates, recently expressed his preference for holding IRC meetings instead of regular calls. He argued that substantive discussions should happen on GitHub or the mailing list to avoid excluding those who cannot attend regularly or miss important discussions. Peter Todd supported this idea and added that textual communication poses fewer barriers compared to audio/visual meetings. The current process rules for version 1.0 include biweekly Google Hangouts, unanimous approval for substantive spec changes, and two interoperable implementations for implementation changes. During the approach to version 1.1, they are considering a more inclusive and better-recorded IRC meeting but acknowledge that it could be lower-bandwidth.They are also considering having a more formal approval method for PRs with a "CONSENSUS:YES" tag. Rene suggested creating a wiki page to make the process transparent and link it from README.md. Rusty Russell proposed revisiting the current process rules as they approach 1.1 and aims to clear all 1.0 PRs this week for tagging in the next meeting. Despite the benefits of live meetings, conducting finalization in them is unfair to those who cannot attend regularly or miss relevant discussions. Therefore, substantive discussions should preferably happen on GitHub or the mailing list.</p>
