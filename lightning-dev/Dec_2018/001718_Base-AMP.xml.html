    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the message revolves around invoices that do not have a specified amount, where the payer dictates how much to pay. In such cases, it is necessary to send the total amount to the payee as part of the onion final hop, in case the invoice has no specified amount. This discussion follows an earlier proposal for signaling temporary underpayments with the "more is coming" bit. ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about what happens if two payment paths fail and suggests merging them into a single payment along the expensive fourth path. However, using 'numpaths' overcommits to what you will do in the future and is unnecessary anyway. The payee is interested in the total value, not the details of the split. Rusty Russell acknowledges this point made by ZmnSCPxj.</p>
