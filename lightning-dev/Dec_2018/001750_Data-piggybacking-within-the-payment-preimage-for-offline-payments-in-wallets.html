    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, ZmnSCPxj and Jose discuss the possibility of not having to replenish invoices for machines that offer services instead of physical products. ZmnSCPxj suggests that a cheap EEPROM could store several hundred thousand invoices, and it would be beneficial to replenish them at each checkup. However, they acknowledge that the person who replenishes the machine is typically not a technician. They propose adding instructions to make the process easier. The conversation shifts to payment decorrelation, which will be fixed by moving to points and scalars. This will eliminate the need for storage of invoices in the offline machine and allow for hierarchical derivation. Overall, the conversation discusses ways to streamline the process of invoice replenishment for service-based machines.</p>
