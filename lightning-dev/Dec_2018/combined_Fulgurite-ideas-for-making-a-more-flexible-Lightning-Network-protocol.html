        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Trey Del Bonis has proposed a new Lightning Network extension called Fulgurite that aims to make the network more flexible and fault-tolerant. The proposal merges user balances and HTLCs into different types of "channel partitions" that can be tracked on a graph moving forward in time. This simplifies splicing and subchannels and enables discreet log contracts in channels, improving anonymity. Trey has provided a document describing Fulgurite and a toy implementation of its core parts for experimentation.The email thread discusses the validation of channel data and how to loosen restrictions on what information is validated. The validation only requires signatures from one or both endpoints proving that both sides of the channel have agreed. For Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories, a single channel announcement will be done for all channels within the factory. Each channel within the factory would then need channel updates only signed off by the two direct participants in the channel.The conversation between Trey and ZmnSCPxj revolves around the implementation of multiparty channels in LN, specifically Fulgurite as a nested channel in BDW. The standard should only care about effective balance between parties in each subchannel regardless of implementation. Lying on gossip is not possible in LN since it would allow giving fake channels that cannot route payments. On-chain funds must be visibly locked to ensure lying attacks are costly. BDW subchannels can produce announcements that say there's much more balance than there is but this is not a problem when routing payments since large payments would fail there anyway.In the future where the public mainnet LN is very large, nodes with limited working memories will drop channels below a specified capacity from their in-memory routemaps since the capacity is something they can verify. The email also discusses Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories, which are multiparty channels with multiple child 2-party channels. It is noted that having multiple channels between the same two participants is not as valuable, which is why Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer only has two levels in the hierarchy, and why the parent level is multiparty while the child level is 2-party. Additionally, the existing update protocols can carry almost any Bitcoin-enforceable contract, including the same contracts used to enforce them, allowing update protocols to "nest" as in Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer.The email notes that Decker-Wattenhofer and Decker-Russell-Osuntokun impose an extra CSV on their transported contracts, and most contracts cannot be transported across systems. Building transactions might not be able to be 100% transparent to the partition behavior, but it is not considered a major restriction at the moment. However, it is important to worry about CSV requirements earlier rather than later since it becomes possible as an attack point if not taken care of properly.It is proposed that time-sensitivity be moved to Fulgurite rather than to higher layers. Higher layers could simply be concerned about what contracts it wants to enter into. The higher layer informs the Fulgurite layer of the shortest absolute timelock in each contract it enters into. The Fulgurite layer then returns to the higher layer the latest block height at which it can still safely collapse the Fulgurite system, or an error that the absolute timelock is too near and already not enforceable at the Fulgurite layer. This helps with periodic re-signings and operations like ExpireHtlc should calculate an earlier deadline at which they'd become accepted and be the thing to actually remove the in-channel HTLC "the right way".The update mechanism can always cancel any contract if all participants in the updateable cryptocurrency system have agreed. One can consider the fulfillment of the hashlock in an HTLC to actually cancel the contract and put its fund into whoever fulfilled it. Similarly, if the timelock on an HTLC is about to expire, then both sides can agree to simply cancel it back to the beneficiary of the timelock branch. Under Poon-Dryja there is no CSV requirement, but under Decker-Wattenhofer and Decker-Russell-Osuntokun, this becomes complicated.The balancing of the cost of transmitting DLC signatures vs. the benefit of earning a little money for routing is up to the Fulgurite user. It would be nice to publish update_channel messages with balances and fees in each direction in a channel, signed by both sides instead of only one side. However, current implementations already work well without this information and it greatly increases bandwidth use for gossip.The conversation between Trey Del Bonis and ZmnSCPxj also revolved around the Fulgurite system, which is designed to allow discreet log contracts (DLCs) and Lightning-visible routing nodes to coexist.</p>
