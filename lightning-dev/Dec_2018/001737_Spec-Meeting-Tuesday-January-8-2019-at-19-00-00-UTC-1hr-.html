    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The next Lightning Development Specification Meeting will be held on IRC's freenode channel. The meeting was deferred from Christmas Eve to January, and all are welcome to attend. The agenda will be posted 12 hours prior to the meeting, and anyone can suggest additions or request edit access. All spec changes must pass without objection at this meeting to be included, with the exception of spelling and wording fixes, which only require two positive reviews from contributors. During the meeting, they generally walk through each pending PR and issue, noting which ones are acknowledged, and someone applies the approved ones post-meeting. They also share concerns, upcoming events, and implementation headaches on Other Business. While most of the work occurs on the mailing list and GitHub, this meeting has given them a chance to nag each other, discuss directly, and contribute greatly to the bonhomie of Lightning. You can find a timezone converter and Google Calendar link in the provided links.</p>
