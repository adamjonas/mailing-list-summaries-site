    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo is in favor of having IRC meetings instead of regular calls for Lightning development updates. He believes that substantive discussions should happen on GitHub or the mailing list rather than in live meetings, which can be unfair to those who cannot attend regularly or miss important discussions. Peter Todd supports this idea and adds that textual communication poses fewer barriers for many people compared to audio/visual meetings. Some people may not want their face or voice to be seen or heard during meetings. The latest call doc seems to be only somewhat sparsely attended. Matt suggests holding an IRC meeting at the same time as the regular calls on #lightning-dev.</p>
