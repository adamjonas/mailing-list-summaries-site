    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The c-lightning team has released version 0.9.1, which includes major bugfixes to multi-part payments and various speedups and improvements. Multi-part payments have been made more robust and official plugins create commands multiwithdraw and multifundchannel to easily produce a single transaction that does multiple things. There is now less log spam when log-level is set to debug, and startup checks confirm that bitcoind is the correct version and relays transactions. Builtin plugins are now nominated as important, and you can nominate others as important too. The daemon will stop if these fail. Channels that are not updated in both directions every two weeks are pruned, and invoices now supply more than one routehint if necessary. PSBT APIs are fleshed out with utxopsbt and locktime arguments, and plugins can mark commands and options deprecated. Also, a new channel_state_changed notification lets plugins easily track channel behavior. More details can be found on their GitHub page.</p>
