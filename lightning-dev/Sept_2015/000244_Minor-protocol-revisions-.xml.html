    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Rusty Russell and aj discussed the state coverage testing for a certain code. Although Rusty suggested drawing diagrams to perform exhaustive testing, he acknowledged that it was not enough. However, he was unsure of what the code actually does with the exhaustive testing as there were many asserts which may only be testing if things "don't crash" instead of whether they "make sense". He proposed having optional output of traces for successful test cases to make it more evident. Furthermore, aj speculated on the behavior of the CLOSE protocol when there are HTLCs in progress. Despite being expected and normal protocol behavior, aj suggested that CLOSE should track HTLCs and spend when timeouts hit or Râ€™s become known, similar to when a commitment is published.</p>
