    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the implementation of a beacon network in Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Anthony Towns suggests using n*k beacons at any point in time, with the oldest k replaced every d days. The group discusses ideas to scale and modify parameters as the network grows, including scaling n with log2(number nodes) and utilizing DHTs for routes/fees.In terms of route prices, two cheapest beacons and three beacons from cohorts 3-n with recent currency and long term visibility would work okay. They also talk about the selection of new cohorts of beacons and leakage of routes from nearby almost-beacons. The payment protocol will likely be used in the future, and there is also discussion around the possibility of doing economic stimulus by randomly selecting some people, giving them a million dollars, and announcing their home addresses.Finally, they discuss the possibility that the entire network could become corrupted and alternatives that could lead even faster to centralization. This conversation centers around the medium-to-long term implementation of onion routing and its various intricacies. The discussion touches on the use of beacons, error messaging, and route finding. One individual suggests that beacons may not be robust enough to handle routing and proposes an alternative method. The conversation also touches on lightning nodes and their relationship with Bitcoin fees. They discuss the possibility of differentiating between local and global payments but ultimately decide it is unnecessary at this stage.</p>
