    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about routing in Lightning Network, there is a consensus that the network topology would have each wallet connected to only one node, implying that there would be multiple paths to a target user and some nodes might even be connected only to other nodes. However, this puzzles one of the participants since he expected the network topology to look different. Routing should reduce the number of hops as it is faster and cheaper. The goal is to optimize a formula that minimizes the number of channels and the number of hops. There are concerns about blocking payments, especially by regulatory bodies, and if there's a communication blockage, there's no ability to route around it. This means that having an application-level routing on top of IP routing is necessary.</p>
