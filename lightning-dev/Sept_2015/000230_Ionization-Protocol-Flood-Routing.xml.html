    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mats Jerratsch and Pieter Wuille had a conversation about the design of a payment channel network. They discussed various topics such as the number of beacons required, the efficiency of using beacon nodes for transactions, and the use of IRC channels for node discovery. The possibility of adding a reputation or web-of-trust system was also explored. The group discussed the issue of centralization with reputation systems and the need for a priority mechanism for information packages. They also talked about developing a Lightning Network node, which included discussions on channel setup and network robustness. The use of protobufs and separating nodes and clients in head-design were also considered. However, they found difficulties in implementing and proving anchor transactions in the blockchain as a map of the network. One member is working on a simulation project for lightning to determine whether a reputation system is necessary.They exchanged apologies for the inconvenience caused by opening a new thread. The possibility of using basic peer discovery schemes like IRC or stable-nodes was also discussed to solve the problem of connecting to the network. Overall, the conversation provided insights into the technical aspects of designing a payment channel network and developing a Lightning Network node.</p>
