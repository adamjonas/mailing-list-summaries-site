    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, various updates and concerns regarding the Lightning Network protocol are discussed. Close now has a second ACK stage which indicates that the close ACK has been received. The rationale behind existing closing flows and states is difficult to understand, prompting a request for an updated version of the svg. An HTLC rejection has been added for cases such as bad routes or insufficient fees. Additionally, there is now an upper bound of 0.04 BTC (about $10USD) on each HTLC which covers micropayment uses of lightning. However, the low ceiling raises concerns that the micropayment use case is the primary target while scalability and speed are more interesting properties of lightning. It's suggested that a higher limit of 1 BTC may have been preferred but this can be changed later. Furthermore, it's noted that one cannot lose more than the channel capacity due to bugs, so this parameter can also be adjusted.</p>
