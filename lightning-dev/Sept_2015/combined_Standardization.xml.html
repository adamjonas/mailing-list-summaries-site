        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The communication between Pierre and CJP revolves around the need for a well-organized process of collecting and documenting design ideas and trade-off argumentation to increase interoperability between several pieces of software being developed. CJP proposed using a Git repository containing all concepts and standards, exchanging new ideas, amendments, etc. Rusty suggested an RFC-like process for Lightning, which is good for nailing down proposal details. However, they're not so good with brainstorming future stuff or concepts. CJP loves separating concepts and standards. There are plenty of interesting concepts which may eventually percolate into standards once they get some kind of consensus, and he doesn't want to lose track of them all because they're not an immediate priority. The writer notes that there are some differences in how different people think certain problems should be addressed. While design decisions in Lightning do not require the same "consensus" as block validity rules in Bitcoin, some decisions carry a strong network effect and may be hard to reverse once made.</p>
