    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Jasper Hugunin proposed an idea to address the problem with high/low priority in which two users, Alice and Bob, send PKT_UPDATE and transition to WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_ACCEPT. Both receive the other's update, but are unsure which one is the official update. Hugunin suggests that Alice and Bob agree on a new update that combines both updates, allowing for bidirectional updates. However, this solution would add complexity to the protocol. A potential alternative solution would be to batch updates for better performance. Rusty notes that the duplicated state issue is due to the way the code was written for simpler testing purposes, but in practice, it could be resolved with a one-liner.</p>
