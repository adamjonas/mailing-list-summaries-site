        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin subreddit, Andrew Miller asks about any drawbacks of an alternative proposal to lightning paper. The main difference is the use of timelocks to guarantee revocability instead of a key/hash scheme, but this requires stronger malleability fixes which are unlikely anytime soon. Additionally, the decreasing timelock on the channel limits its lifetime compared to relative lock time lightning channels. Every HTLC on the channel has to have a larger timelock on the refund side. The proposal may be worth looking into further if the chained revocation secrets turn out to be insecure or too heavyweight. However, setting Delta T to 1 hour seems irrelevant and bogus.The discussion surrounding the proposed fast and scalable payment network for Bitcoin in the paper seems to have been derailed due to concerns about the alternative solution presented. It is unclear if there are any downsides to the proposal, and the link to the paper is not provided. Anyone interested in reading the Reddit thread can access it through the provided URL.</p>
