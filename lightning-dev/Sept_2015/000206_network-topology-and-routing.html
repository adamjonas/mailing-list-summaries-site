    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The sender apologizes for the delay, explaining that Blockstream had a big meeting after the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin workshop. The recipient mentions meeting Fabrice at the event and is interested in attending the Hong Kong event. The sender says they started where the recipient is currently, but had to throw it away to make it more distributed-by-default. They aim to make all nodes equal by design and be clever with routing. The recipient shares a link to a discussion they found, admitting that the path they are taking is ambitious. The sender responds saying they have a method too, but it won't scale infinitely. The conversation ends with Pierre expressing excitement to see their method.</p>
