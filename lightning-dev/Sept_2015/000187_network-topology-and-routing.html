    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network is an off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin that aims to increase transaction speeds and reduce fees by creating a network of interconnected payment channels. A consensus has emerged regarding the target network topology, which implies the existence of multiple paths to a target user and the need for several hops to reach them. Some nodes may even be connected only to other nodes. However, this puzzles Pierre, who expected the network topology to look different. He believes that nodes connected only to other nodes shouldn't exist and that payments should go through at most two hops or just one if the users are connected to the same node.Pierre argues that reducing the number of hops is incentivized because it makes transactions faster and cheaper. He questions why routing needs to be more complicated than agreeing on a standard port, as in the way the internet works currently. He asks why there is a need for application-level routing on top of IP routing.</p>
