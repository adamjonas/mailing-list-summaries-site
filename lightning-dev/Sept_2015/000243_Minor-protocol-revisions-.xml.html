    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A discussion is taking place between Anthony Towns and Pierre regarding the updated version of svg. Aj, previously designed a flow which has been updated by Towns to work more efficiently. The updated svg can be viewed at <a href="http://azure.erisian.com.au/">http://azure.erisian.com.au/</a>~aj/tmp/lightstate/simplified-states-20150929.svg. However, some transitions are still missing. The discussion continues with Towns explaining the issues he faced while testing states coverage. He explains that thorough testing requires more than throwing every packet at it and recording what happens, stating that state doesn't quite encapsulate everything. Furthermore, he says that simulating pairs and covering all combinations of states between them, as well as taking into account non-packet events, like timeouts and bitcoin watch events, are also important. Finally, he adds that injecting errors is also necessary. After updating the final result, Towns pushed it online.</p>
