        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin subreddit, Andrew Miller raises a question about the potential drawbacks of a proposed alternative to the lightning paper. The main distinction between the two papers lies in the use of timelocks in the alternative solution, which ensures revocability instead of employing a key/hash scheme. However, a significant drawback is the necessity for stronger malleability fixes, which are not expected to be implemented in the near future. Moreover, the alternative approach imposes a decreasing timelock on the channel, thereby limiting its lifespan when compared to relative lock time lightning channels.Another drawback of the proposed alternative is that every Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) established on the channel requires a longer timelock on the refund side. This requirement may pose challenges and complexities in practical implementations. Despite these concerns, the proposal might warrant further investigation if the security or efficiency of the chained revocation secrets is found to be compromised.However, a point of contention raised by Miller is the seemingly irrelevant and questionable decision to set Delta T to 1 hour. This aspect of the proposal casts doubt on its validity and practicality.Overall, the discussion on the Bitcoin subreddit regarding a fast and scalable payment network with Bitcoin appears to have deviated from its original focus. While the link to the specific paper is not provided, interested readers can access the Reddit thread through the URL provided.</p>
