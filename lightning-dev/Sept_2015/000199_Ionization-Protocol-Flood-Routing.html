    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between two individuals, Rusty and Amos, discussed alternative routing schemes for Lightning Network. Rusty proposed an alternate scheme which involves a set of randomly selected "beacon" nodes to propagate the cheapest route to and from those nodes. To receive payment, B picks a few beacon nodes at random and sends those routes to A who chooses the best option. Some details that need clarification include the number of beacon nodes, how long before a beacon becomes active, how long before a beacon node is invalid, how to avoid fake beacons, and how to update beacon routing. For now, they will use a global comms mechanism like IRC as a prototype hack. On the other hand, Amos proposed a scheme for flood-based route finding that could allow efficient route finding while keeping the shape of the network hidden and giving onion-like anonymity. However, the scheme has a trivial denial of service attack that needs to be solved.</p>
