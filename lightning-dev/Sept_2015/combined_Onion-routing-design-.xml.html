        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a series of email conversations and discussions on the Lightning Network mailing list, Rusty Russell discusses the vulnerability of the network to route probing attacks. The lack of MAC protection leaves the system open to nosy nodes replacing routing entirely and guessing the final destination correctly. Russell suggests several partial defenses, including disallowing two HTLCs with the same R value and probabilistic backoff for duplicate R values. However, these solutions have potential probing attack issues, and parallel probes are limited by channel capacity.To address the problem, Russell proposes having two R values, one known only by the recipient and one by the sender, making htlcs payable on presentation of both R and S. He also suggests re-padding the onion blob when forwarding and encrypting 0 padding using a pubkey.Anthony Towns suggests combining this approach with using OFB or CTR mode for the symmetric cipher and setting S as sha256(H+X) where X is the plaintext routing message. The format of a route should require bytes of data decrypted by each node using its own pubkey to reveal where the data should go next and how much fee can be taken.Zooko Wilcox-OHearn requested notes about requirements/desiderata from Rusty for a network that is a source routing network. In this type of network, the sender details the payment path because fees vary with path and the sender pays. To maintain financial privacy, an onion routing-style setup where each node only knows prev and next seems most sensible.Rusty is currently working on test code in which there are one node hop and full route description in the onion structure. The receive on a node works by using ECDH on onion→hop[0]→pubkey and Rusty's privkey to extract the secret key. Then deriving enckey (SHA256(seckey || 0)), hmackey (SHA256(seckey || 1)), iv (SHA256(seckey || 2)) and pad_iv (SHA256(seckey || 3)).After checking HMAC of every part of struct onion after hmac (including pubkey) and decrypting (AES 256 CTR mode, using enckey and iv above) struct onion from pubkey onwards, first struct hop is for us and to forward, remove first hop, and append padding (thus keeping total length the same). Finally, padding is generated by AES-256-CTR encrypting all-zeroes with enckey and pad_iv, resulting in even the final node having no idea of path length. However, generating this onion correctly is a bit tricky, but it is perfectly possible. Unused hops are filled with random garbage.The purpose behind all these processes is to garble the padding and render the payment unredeemable without relying on any verification or cooperation from anyone else on the network. Overall, onion routing offers limited protection against correlating HTLCs by R value, and signing errors and using the 'sum' field as a secret key seems sensible to prevent information leakage to passive observers on the route.</p>
