        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a proposed off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin that aims to increase transaction speeds and reduce fees. There is a consensus that the network topology should have multiple paths to a target user, and some nodes may even be connected only to other nodes. However, Pierre suggests that having nodes connected only to other nodes shouldn't exist, and payments should go through at most two hops or just one if the users are connected to the same node. This is because reducing the number of hops makes transactions faster and cheaper.There are concerns about blocking payments, especially by regulatory bodies, and if there's a communication blockage, there's no ability to route around it. Therefore, having an application-level routing on top of IP routing is necessary. Pierre suggests having a limited number of specialized supernodes strongly typed as mainly sending or receiving money to optimize efficiency, but this could be detrimental to privacy. Setting up channels isn't free, so minimizing the number of channels and hops for a transaction is important. In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Pierre, the idea of a flatter design for Lightning Network was discussed. The two agreed on the advantages of having everyone running a node despite initial thoughts of having a limited number of specialized supernodes. It was suggested that users should only have a handful of channels set up with well-connected nodes to minimize blockchain transactions and locked-up bitcoins. However, Pierre raised concerns about the reliability and low latency of having many small nodes constantly appearing and disappearing. When asked about the need for application-level routing on top of the IP routing, Rusty explained that non-IP routing is still necessary because the lightning network is an overlay network of channels across multiple networks, and there's no logical grouping to make routing tables smaller than "every node". The conversation also touched on the potential issues of joining the Lightning Network, payment blocking, and communication blockages. Rusty believes that these issues can be mitigated by having every participant of the network connected to a few nodes and being clever with routing. He also mentioned that he has a method that might work for a few million nodes but won't scale infinitely. The sender apologizes for the delay, explaining that Blockstream had a big meeting after the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin workshop. The conversation ends with Pierre expressing excitement to see their method.</p>
