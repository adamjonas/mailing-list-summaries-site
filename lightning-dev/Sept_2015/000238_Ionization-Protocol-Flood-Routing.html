    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns discusses the potential issues that beacons will face in the lightning network. It is suggested that fees erode channels and, as a result, beacons may raise their fees to 1% or 2%. The number of beacons and bandwidth also puts a limit on the transactions per second of the lightning network. A maximum of around 73k lightning transactions per second is estimated, which is about the same as VisaNet stress tests. It is suggested that increasing the number of beacons with network size would help improve the situation. Additionally, the conversation discusses the possibility of routing by proximity but highlights that it may not be efficient and could lead to banks being able to directly correlate payments. Suggestions are made for further research into these issues.</p>
