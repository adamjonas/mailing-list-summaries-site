        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation, a user named v e enquires about using Lightning Charge API for a merchant app and consumer wallet app. They want to know if they need to run a Bitcoin Core node and how to tie the merchant wallet to the invoice. Christian Decker responds by outlining that to use Lightning Charge, the user needs a full bitcoind node synced with the network, a c-lightning node, and npm + lightning-charge running to give access to the REST API. He also mentioned that invoices are tracked by c-lightning, and customers will need their own Lightning client and open channels to the network to send payments.V e also asks if they need a bitcoin node, c-lightning + charge node per merchant for their server-client model, to which Christian advises against as it is not advisable due to security issues. Instead, he recommends building a layer in-between that differentiates tenants and controls access to individual resources. The conversation then shifted to building a server-client model where multiple merchants could accept payments from end customers. However, it was stated that neither c-lightning nor Lightning Charge (or any other implementation) is multi-tenant, which means someone with access to the RPC has full control over all channels and funds in the daemon.It was emphasized that every user, whether customer or shop, should run their own nodes instead of relying on large managed infrastructure. In addition, the email thread discusses various aspects of the Lightning Network implementation, including c-lightning, lnd, and eclair. The thread also covers questions related to the deployment of merchant wallets and consumer wallets in a multi-tenant environment. There is a request for code examples related to tying up merchant wallet to an invoice and sending satoshi to that invoice id.</p>
