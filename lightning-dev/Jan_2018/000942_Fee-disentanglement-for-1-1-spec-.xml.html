    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion between Johan and Rusty regarding the Lightning Network implementation, they discussed the current problem of one side (funder) setting fees while the other side needs to ensure they are sufficient. The solution proposed is to have both sides set fees independently, which will work well with dual-funder proposals. The implementation involves both sides setting an initial fee in 'open_channel', where the counterparty checks it's reasonable. An 'update_fee' message has no effect on the other side but is applied to the sender when they 'revoke_and_ack'. Any new HTLCs added must be paid for by the sender, and if the recipient cannot afford the fees, they must pull from their reserve and the other side. Another issue raised was predicting future fees, which can be solved by allowing multiple simultaneous fee levels, although this requires more work and storage due to multiple signatures in each 'commitment_signed' message.</p>
