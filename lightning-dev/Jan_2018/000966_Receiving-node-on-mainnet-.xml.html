    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The sender of the email thanked Adán for his help and informed him that they would share their node_id on Discord to avoid creating an off-topic conversation on the dev mailing list. Adán recommended the #mainnet channel on the LN Discord platform and offered to open a channel and play "the invoice game" back and forth if the sender shared their node_id and IP address with him. Adán is the CTO of Stampery Inc., which has offices in San Francisco and Madrid. The email was sent to the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. No information was provided in the email attachment, which was in HTML format.</p>
