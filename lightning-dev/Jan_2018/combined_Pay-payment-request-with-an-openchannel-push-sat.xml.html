        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jonathan Underwood has proposed a new feature for the Lightning Network, which he has discussed with Roasbeef. The feature involves allowing payment recipients to set their payment status to "WAITING_OPEN" if they receive an "open_channel" message with push_msat greater than or equal to the value of the payment request and where the temporary_channel_id contains the r_hash. Once the channel is open, the payment moves to a "PAID" status. If while waiting for the channel to open in the WAITING_OPEN state, a routed payment is received with the r_hash, it should be accepted and the payment status changed to PAID. Jonathan has suggested this feature due to the long wait times for opening channels, which can take up to 10 minutes. He also believes that such a feature would allow people to signal intent to pay, thereby enabling payment processors that generate payment requests with short expiration times to react accordingly. However, Rusty Russell, another member of the community, has expressed concern about the proposed feature, stating that it introduces trust into the system and proposing instead that users simply open a channel and make a payment rather than using push_msat.</p>
