    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the usefulness of RFCs, Benjamin Mord suggests that a brief explanation of terms such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" would be helpful in protocol definitions. In response, Rusty Russell explains that these terms are already covered by RFC2119. He goes on to discuss how a "MUST" requirement should be treated: nodes violating a "MUST" should be considered non-compliant with protocol consensus and even hostile. However, a "MUST" does not guarantee that other nodes will adhere to it. Rusty also notes that requirements can be divided into sender and receiver, with different consequences for each. Finally, he acknowledges that the specification does not always adhere to these principles, but bugs are fixed as they are found.</p>
