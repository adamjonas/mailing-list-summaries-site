    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation between Benjamin Mord and Christian Decker revolves around the use of source routing in lightning transactions. Although Mord is yet to complete his review of BOLTs, he points out that the concept of source routing opens up many potential use cases that involve collaborations with intermediaries of various sorts. He praises the explicit extensibility addressed in the BOLTs. In response to Mord's question, Decker mentions that the payment hash is the only constant information kept along the entire route and they plan to remove it for further decorrelation of hops. However, they have the possibility of adding some information in the onion packet that can be read by all intermediate nodes or only specific ones. Decker asks Mord about his intended use case for this feature.</p>
