        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In recent discussions on the Lightning-dev mailing list, participants debated the necessity and potential drawbacks of payment limits for Bitcoin's Lightning Network. While some view these limits as necessary to prevent centralization, others argue that they hinder important use cases, such as large payment channels and routing of LN payments. Some suggest that removing the limits in the future would encourage the growth of a mesh network.However, concerns were expressed about the risks associated with larger channel sizes and the potential for attacks. Additionally, there were concerns that businesses may not be able to operate using Lightning due to the small channel sizes and payment limits. The upper 32 bits must be zero for channels with chain_hash identifying the Bitcoin blockchain, which gives a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC. However, this limit is not imposed for other similar cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin.Discussions also touched on the issue of avoiding "super nodes" in the network and the possibility of keeping most funds in cold storage. Bitcoin developers Christian Decker and Andy Schroder exchanged emails discussing the concept of promoting a healthier network in the long term by discouraging "super nodes" from existing. Schroder suggested avoiding making connections to nodes that have large channel capacities with other parties to achieve this goal. However, Decker questioned the effectiveness of this method since it is easy for a large node to masquerade as smaller ones, resulting in UTXO fragmentation.They also discussed the ability to split up large payments into smaller ones without incurring too much cost or trouble, but mentioned that this is not possible when creating channels. Schroder argued that many small channels would be partially self-regulating because people would have to pay more for on-chain transaction fees when opening and closing channels, which could encourage growth towards a mesh network rather than more central forms. Decker disagreed with this approach, noting that he doesn't see why he would care about a remote channel's capacity aside from it being large enough to cover the amount he wants to transfer. He also sees the limit as purely self-defense on how much value he's confident enough to keep in a channel.Multipath payments were suggested as a solution to splitting single payments into multiple invoices, which has bad semantic properties. The article concludes that while current protocol limits may seem restrictive, they are necessary for security reasons and to encourage the growth of the network towards a mesh network. Changes to these limits can be made on a per-channel level using feature bits without the need to fork lightning. Overall, the email exchanges provide insights into the ongoing discussion around the capacity limit on Lightning channels. While differing opinions exist, most agreed that more experience with the network was needed before making any final decisions.</p>
