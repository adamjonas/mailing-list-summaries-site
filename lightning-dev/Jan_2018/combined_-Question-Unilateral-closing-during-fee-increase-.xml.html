        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, a user asked if one side of the channel has 100% of funds, can the last message give that user complete control over the channel to close it unilaterally without any interaction from the other side. The only trustless way to transfer control of funds from one-sided back to both parties would be an on-chain transaction. This puts trust into the system and if one is going to trust anyway, they can probably trust that the other side will inform them of pending shutdown on their side and cooperatively close. Another user inquired about what course of action to take if a commitment transaction will never confirm due to low fees. They suggested using out-of-band fee payment mechanisms such as confirmtx.com and pushtx.btc.com to get the transaction mined without an on-blockchain payment. In the future, SIGHASH flag magic could be used to add an extra input that could go to fees or add both a new input and output, where the difference goes to fees. However, this would change the TXID of the commitment transaction. If keeping the TXID intact is important, one solution would be to always add a small output to every commitment transaction that anyone can spend.</p>
