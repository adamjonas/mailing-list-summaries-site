        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin development mailing list and Lightning-dev mailing list have been discussing issues related to closing channels on the Lightning Network. One problem is when a channel partner disappears, leaving behind transactions that may never get confirmed at the expected fee rate. The only remedy in this situation is to wait for the other person to come back online and use CPFPs to redeem the to_remote output. However, since CSV will cause script verification to fail, a CPFP transaction will not be propagated. Some solutions suggested include using out-of-band fee payment mechanisms such as Confirmtx.com and Pushtx.btc.com or using a Lightning transaction to pay for those services more cheaply than on-chain payments.Another issue discussed is the possibility of one side of a channel having complete control over it. This would allow them to unilaterally close the channel without input from the other side and potentially change the fee size. The only trustless way to transfer control of the funds from one-sided back to both parties would be an on-chain transaction, which assumes that the other party will inform you of any pending shutdown and cooperatively close the channel. Thus, the discussion highlights the importance of trust in the Lightning Network. Overall, the discussions revolve around potential problems with closing channels and possible solutions to overcome those issues.</p>
