        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email exchange, Johan and Pierre discuss a corner case in which a node may fail the channel due to insufficient fees. Pierre notes that this situation is similar to a race condition described in BOLT 2 and specifies that it may be appropriate to fail the channel if the fundee would end up with all funds in an unpublishable transaction. Johan agrees and adds that these cases are unlikely to occur with the right choice of parameters. They conclude that it is less error-prone to fail the channel instead of trying to recover from it.The links provided in the email include BOLT 2 and BOLT 3, which specify how to handle these situations, as well as the Lightning Network RFCs. Additionally, Johan posted a question on how Eclair and c-lightning handle a specific scenario involving Alice and Bob adding HTLCs simultaneously with low balances. This could potentially violate the channel reserve requirement or deplete the entire channel if the reserve is set to zero. Johan asks for the expected way of handling this situation from both Alice and Bob's perspective. Pierre suggests that an appropriate choice of channel parameters mainly max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat, channel_reserve_satoshis, max_accepted_htlcs could probably reduce the probability of insufficient fees happening. Two links are also provided: [1] for updating fees and [2] for fee payment in lightning transactions.</p>
