        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network allows annotations to be added to a lightning transaction that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route. Furthermore, specific annotations readable only by certain known intermediaries are possible. The payment hash is the only piece of information that is kept constant along the entire route, but it will be removed in order to further decorrelate hops of a payment and make it harder for forwarding nodes to collate hops into a route. It is, however, possible to add information in the onion packet, even giving every hop its specific details. For example, if a node converts currency, the desired exchange rate may be specified in the onion. The concept of source routing opens up potential use cases that involve collaborations with intermediaries of various sorts, but flexible communication capability would be desirable or necessary. It is impressive how cleanly and explicitly the BOLTs address extensibility. There was a BOLT#6, which was a trivial bootstrapping mechanism set up using IRC, but it was retired in favor of DNS seeds and gossiping.</p>
