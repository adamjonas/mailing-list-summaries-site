    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses the use of RFC2119 and its intent. The author argues that the use of MUST in RFC2119 invites lazy thought in protocol design, where details need not be sold as beneficial to individuals. However, the author clarifies that the idea behind RFC2119 is that implementations must follow MUSTs, but there is no enforcement by vendors or any governing body. The only enforcement is by the community at large, where an implementation that does not follow a MUST may harm the implementation financially or not be purchased by network operators. Private implementations are not bound by these rules, but if they become significant enough, they go through the standardization process before becoming an issue within the community.</p>
