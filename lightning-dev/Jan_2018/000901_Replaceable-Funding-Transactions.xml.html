    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around the possibility of opening Lightning Network channels using replaceable transactions. The participants agree that it should work as long as implementations on both ends support channel multiplexing. However, the accepting node expresses concerns about receiving too many channel requests that never confirm and hopes for a future BOLT spec to include a cancel_channel message. The idea of developing a wallet that keeps transactions replaceable is also brought up, but it would require waiting for funding_signed from all counterparties before broadcasting a replacement transaction. Finally, the lack of ways to control transaction fees after a broadcasted transaction contributes to frustration surrounding blockchain transaction fees.</p>
