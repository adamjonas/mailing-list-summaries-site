    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this email is inquiring about the possibility of using replaceable funding transactions (replace-by-fee) in BOLT v1.0 to address the issue of slow transaction confirmation on the blockchain level. The BOLT spec suggests that a non-funding node should forget the channel if it does not see the funding transaction after a reasonable timeout. The author believes it is possible to do RBF funding transactions as long as the counterparty allows multiple channels per peer. The suggested consideration includes sending an open_channel for channel #1, receiving accept_channel for channel #1, creating an RBF-able funding transaction for low feerate, sending funding_created for channel #1, receiving funding_signed for channel #1, waiting on the blockchain, increasing the fee rate, sending open_channel for channel #2 to the same party, receiving accept_channel for channel #2, creating a replacement funding transaction for high feerate, sending funding_created for channel #2, receiving funding_signed for channel #2, waiting on the blockchain, sending funding_locked for channel #2, receiving funding_locked for channel #2, and letting the counterparty forget channel #1. The author asks if this is possible in the current BOLT spec, except for the fact that c-lightning restricts channels.</p>
