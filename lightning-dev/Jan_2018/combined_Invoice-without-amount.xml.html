        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A user on Lightning-dev has raised a point that c-lightning currently does not allow users to create amountless invoices via the "invoice" command. They note that c-lightning is capable of paying amountless invoices using the "pay" command and request for this issue to be addressed. Rusty Russell responded by acknowledging the issue and filing it on GitHub so that it wouldn't be lost. He also provided a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning via the "lightning-cli pay" command, but noted that he would prefer the "msatoshi" field to have a magic string instead of being omitted to avoid bugs. In an email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Rusty Russell, Cezary asked if Lightning Labs had plans to introduce a feature soon or if they would have to switch to c-lightning. Rusty pointed out that the issue should be addressed on lnd's issue tracker rather than through emails. ZmnSCPxj via Lightning-dev mentioned that currently, c-lightning can pay amountless invoices but cannot create them via the invoice command. Rusty filed an issue for this on Github and provided a solution to pay an amountless invoice in c-lightning. He also suggested that the "msatoshi" field should be a magic string rather than omitting the parameter since it could lead to bugs. The Lightning Network's c-lightning command has the ability to pay invoices without an amount, but cannot create them through the "invoice" command. The "pay" command can be used to pay an amountless invoice by specifying the Lightning Network Invoice (LNI) and the number of satoshis to pay. While the JSON-RPC command requires an amount, the rest of the code treats it as optional, meaning that the internals of c-lightning should be able to handle creating amountless invoices. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, stated that he will investigate how to enable the creation of amountless invoices in c-lightning. A user expressed their preference to stay with Lightning Labs' implementation, lnd, but inquired about whether c-lightning would introduce a feature soon. Specifically, they wanted to know if c-lightning would be able to create invoices via the "invoice" command, as it currently only allows for payment of amountless invoices through the "pay" command. Rusty Russell responded to this inquiry by acknowledging the issue and filing it on GitHub so that it wouldn't be lost. He also provided a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning via the "lightning-cli pay" command, but noted that he would prefer the "msatoshi" field to have a magic string instead of being omitted to avoid bugs.In conclusion, a user on the lightning-dev mailing list was seeking confirmation that the value for an invoice would be optional or if there is another way to send payment when the sender specifies an amount. Olaoluwa Osuntokun invited the user to make an issue on lnd's issue tracker. A link to the Github page detailing the payment encoding process for the Lightning Network was also referred to. Rusty Russell acknowledged the issue and filed it on Github for c-lightning, which currently cannot create amountless invoices via the invoice command.</p>
