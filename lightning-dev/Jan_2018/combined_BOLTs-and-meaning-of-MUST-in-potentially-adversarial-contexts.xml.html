        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The use of RFC2119 and its intent is discussed in this context. The author argues that using MUST in RFC2119 invites lazy thought in protocol design, where details need not be sold as beneficial to individuals. However, the idea behind RFC2119 is that implementations must follow MUSTs, but there is no enforcement by vendors or any governing body. The only enforcement is by the community at large, where an implementation that does not follow a MUST may harm the implementation financially or not be purchased by network operators.The traditional approach to protocol design assumes cooperative nodes and later tries to retrofit security when it is discovered that not all nodes are operating in good faith. The initial definition of MUST in RFCs presumes good faith and inadvertently invites implementers to lower their guard. It may be worth explicitly stating somewhere along with definitions of SHOULD and MAY. Violation of a MUST should be considered hostile, and it encourages nodes to fail a channel or connection upon observing a violation of that MUST.The RFC 2119 protocol, written in 1997, is harmful to lightning and cryptocurrency protocols as it assumes a world of good guys and bad guys, whereas Satoshi saw every node as pursuing self-interest alone. Cryptocurrency protocol specifications are 100% advisory, so there is no RFC 2119 MUST - only self-interest. Therefore, every detail must be sold, as there is no other source of authority at our disposal. Rusty Russell suggests dividing requirements into sender and receiver, with the former setting X and the latter closing the channel if X is not set or performing another action if X is set.While the spec does not live up to this property in all places, bugs are fixed where found. In conclusion, the article highlights that the initial definition of MUST in RFCs presumes good faith and inadvertently invites implementers to lower their guard. While the use of RFC2119 is useful, it may encourage lazy thought in protocol design. However, the community at large enforces MUSTs, where an implementation that does not follow a MUST may harm the implementation financially or not be purchased by network operators. Cryptocurrency protocol specifications are 100% advisory and there is no other source of authority at our disposal. Rusty Russell suggests dividing requirements into sender and receiver for better implementation.</p>
