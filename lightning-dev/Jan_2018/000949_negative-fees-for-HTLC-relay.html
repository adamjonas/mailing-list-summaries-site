    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mark Friedenbach discusses the possibility of negative fees in Lightning Network. He argues that not all instances where negative fees might be useful have loops, which are necessary for channel rebalancing. Without a cycle, one would simply be paying for someone else's payment to go through their channel. However, Mark acknowledges that there are situations where negative fees could be helpful, such as when the network becomes too weighted on one side of the graph or when the other side is a non-routable endpoint. In both cases, it would be useful to signal to others that one is willing to pay to rebalance, but this feature should not be baked into the gossip protocol itself. Mark suggests that the better solution would be to change the topology of the network or move a sink to the other side of the cut.</p>
