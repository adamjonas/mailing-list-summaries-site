        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ben has inquired about the presence of SegWit in btcd and whether it is possible to run lnd on bitcoind. The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) has merged Segwit into btcd and can now run with bitcoind. Olaoluwa Osuntokun confirms that segwit has already been merged into btcd and encourages the reader to check out the documentation provided in the link. In lnd, the chain backend has been abstracted, which allows it to run with any of the three supported chain backends: btcd, bitcoind, and neutrino. Benjamin Mord had also expressed interest in using Golang but was unsure about the layer 2/layer 1 protocol binding and if it could be abstracted away from the implementation through SPI or other means. The original installation instructions state that btcd with segwit support is yet to be merged into the master branch, but it is possible that they need to be updated. Olaoluwa Osuntokun invites the conversation to continue on #lnd on Freenode for more clarity.Overall, the context revolves around the installation of btcd and segwit support for ln, with Olaoluwa Osuntokun providing clarification on the current status of segwit in btcd and the abstracting of the chain backend in lnd.</p>
