    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this post, the author presents two problems with the current Lightning Network protocol and proposes solutions for each. The first problem is that only one side (funder) sets fees, which can result in disagreements over whether the fees are sufficient or too high, leading to channel closures. The proposed solution is to have both sides set fees independently at the beginning of the channel creation process. This has been implemented in c-lightning. The author suggests disallowing any fee updates that the other side cannot afford based on their current HTLCs and max accepted HTLCs. They also suggest disallowing any new HTLCs that cannot be paid for based on the same calculation. The second problem addressed is that predicting future fees is difficult, so multiple simultaneous fee levels should be allowed. This means including multiple signatures in each commitment_signed message, which requires more work and storage. The post concludes by requesting feedback on these proposals.</p>
