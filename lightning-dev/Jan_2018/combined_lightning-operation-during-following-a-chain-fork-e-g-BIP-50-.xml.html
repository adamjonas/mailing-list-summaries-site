        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email thread among Lightning Network developers discusses the issue of maintaining consensus during or after a fork of the underlying blockchain(s) in lightning nodes. While channel_announcement messages use a chain_hash to identify the currency in use, it is unclear which hash identifies BTC as opposed to BCH. The priority is to get implementations to a state where they can be safely deployed on Bitcoin Mainnet, and greater support for altcoins can be done later. Short channel IDs contain the block height at which the funding transaction confirmed, which might be used to judge if a channel contains forked coins or not.There are concerns about safety despite BIP 50 scenarios, forks with more legitimate contention than seen so far, and also system stability in the face of an increasingly unsophisticated/gullible user base. Resilience against forks is critical to safety, particularly when there are entities financially motivated to fracture that consensus. Adversarial forks that remove segwit or maliciously do not change their signature algorithm are impossible to defend against. However, the focus should be on forks that use strong replay protection in the form of FORKID.The Lightning Network protocol is designed to be robust against nodes failing to broadcast expected blockchain transactions, which provides fork protection as a byproduct. The work remains on analyzing and designing solutions for handling intentional and unintentional forks. Altcoin support is considered a low priority until after optimization and integration of features like RBF and multi-channel funding. Despite concerns about system stability, the safety and resilience against forks are core to cryptocurrency safety.</p>
