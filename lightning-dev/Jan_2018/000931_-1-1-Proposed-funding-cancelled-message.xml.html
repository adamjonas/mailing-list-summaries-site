    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between two members of the Lightning Development mailing list, the issue of channels timing out was discussed. The lack of a protocol-required minimum timeout was identified as the problem, and one member suggested that it would be useful to have something like "a receiving node MUST keep a channel ready to be used for at least a week prior to funding transaction confirmation." Additionally, a potential problem could arise from a malicious node continuously sending `open_channel` -> `funding_created` with random numbers for transaction ID, which could make the cost of tracking an unopened channel arbitrarily high. To avoid this issue, a node implementation could limit the number of pending channel opens for each peer. The proposed `funding_cancelled` message would allow an honest party to free up the limited resource "number of pending channel opens" without having to wait for the timeout.</p>
