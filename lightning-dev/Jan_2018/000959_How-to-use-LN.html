    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation between v e and Christian Decker revolves around the Lightning protocol. V e is trying to understand how a merchant wallet is tied up to an invoice and how a consumer wallet can send satoshi to that invoice id. Christian advises that Lightning Charge or any other implementation is not multi-tenant, which means that it should not be exposed to multiple tenants. He encourages users to run their own nodes instead of relying on large managed infrastructure. V e also asks if he needs to have a bitcoin node, c-lightning + charge node per merchant for his server-client model, to which Christian replies that it is not advisable as someone with access to the RPC has full control over all channels and funds in the daemon. Instead, a layer in between can differentiate tenants and control access to individual resources. There are no code examples provided.</p>
