    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange discusses the proposal of a limit on each peer to reduce the actual CPU, bandwidth and storage resources that each peer can consume on the attacked node. The proposed limit would allow the server to serve more peers and possibly shrug off a 10k or 100k attack that it otherwise would be unable to service if each peer could consume an arbitrary amount of resources on the server. The discussion moves on to the possibility of distributed denial of service attacks and the relative resource consumption differences on an attacker simulating multiple nodes versus one simulating a single node. The email points out that there is no perfect defense against DDoS attacks. It suggests several solutions such as coming closer to stateless on the server side during session setup before knowing the request is going to be followed through/is legitimate and having the ability to shift a transaction from one server to another without losing some essential state.</p>
