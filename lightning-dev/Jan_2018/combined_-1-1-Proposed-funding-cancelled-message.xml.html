        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal has been put forward by ZmnSCPxj via Lightning-dev to inform the fundee node that the funder node is certain that the channel funding transaction can never confirm. The lack of a protocol-required minimum timeout for unopened channels is causing issues with replaceable funding transactions. To implement replace-by-fee funding transactions, one would need to keep track of all versions of the funding transaction and state of each version. The funder needs to keep track of all versions of the funding transaction broadcasted and delete such entries from its database that can never confirm. Sending `funding_cancelled` in this case is simply "being nice", and the fundee ignores this at its own detriment, wasting resources each block to check for a transaction that logically can never confirm.The proposed funding_cancelled message would allow an honest party to free up the limited resource of pending channel opens without having to wait for the timeout. It was suggested that a protocol-required minimum timeout could address the issue of varying concepts for acceptable wait times. However, there are concerns about unnecessary complexity in the protocol and potential denial-of-service attacks from failed channel opening attempts counting as a resource on the receiver.In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo expressed confusion about why a limit of 25 channels per node should cause any issues. The email exchange discusses the proposal of a limit on each peer to reduce the actual CPU, bandwidth, and storage resources that each peer can consume on the attacked node. The proposed limit would allow the server to serve more peers and possibly shrug off a 10k or 100k attack that it otherwise would be unable to service if each peer could consume an arbitrary amount of resources on the server.The discussion moves on to the possibility of distributed denial of service attacks and the relative resource consumption differences on an attacker simulating multiple nodes versus one simulating a single node. It is suggested that solutions like minimizing server-side state during session setup and designing a network of devices that can handle these problems could be useful in preventing similar attacks on the lightning network.Overall, it is important to address potential security risks and solutions before they happen to maintain the trust of the overall network. The proposal has received some criticism but also support for its potential benefits.</p>
