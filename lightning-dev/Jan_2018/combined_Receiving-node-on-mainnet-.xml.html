        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network subreddit is an excellent resource for those looking to test mainnet Lightning Network nodes. The subreddit contains many discussions among users with mainnet nodes and could provide ample individuals for testing. A user named Cezary Dziemian sent an email to the Lightning-dev mailing list asking for advice on becoming a receiving node on the mainnet. To become a receiving node, they suggested talking with existing nodes to convince them to "lock" funds on their side. In response, Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo, the CTO of Stampery Inc., recommended the #mainnet channel on the LN Discord platform. He also offered to play "the invoice game" back and forth if anyone shares their node_id and IP address. Stampery Inc has offices in both San Francisco and Madrid. The email was sent to the Linux Foundation-hosted Lightning-dev mailing list, and no information was provided in the HTML-formatted attachment named 'signature.asc.' The sender of the email thanked Adán for his help and stated that they would share their node_id on Discord to avoid creating an off-topic conversation on the dev mailing list.</p>
