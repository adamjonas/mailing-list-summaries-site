        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In recent discussions on the Lightning Network mailing list, there have been debates regarding the idea of allowing negative fees in payment channels. The proposal was initially suggested by Benjamin Mord and had previously been discussed by Rusty Russell, who found it to be a complicated concept that complicated routing. The discussion centered around the importance of negative shadow prices for optimal constrained network markets, particularly in regard to flows in opposite directions canceling out. However, some members suggested that the analogy may not hold completely, but it is still worth considering.The primary concern with negative fees is the lack of flexibility and special handling required for route finding. Christian Decker argued against negative fees, stating that although they could encourage rebalancing of channels, they were unnecessary and added complexity to routing. Rebalancing can be accomplished by finding a cycle and sending a payment back to oneself. Negative fees also result in less control over the rebalancing process, which can cause losses or forward rejections. It is better to route payments around exhausted channels rather than artificially rebalancing.Despite these concerns, Mark Friedenbach believes that there are instances where negative fees would be useful, such as when the network becomes too weighted on one side of the graph or when the other side is a non-routable endpoint. In both cases, it would be useful to signal to others that one is willing to pay to rebalance, but this feature should not be baked into the gossip protocol itself. The better solution would be to change the topology of the network or move a sink to the other side of the cut.The discussion has also raised questions about whether fees can be negative in the BOLTs and the go source code suggests that it is not possible. However, the author proposes the idea of allowing negative fees in situations where a payment channel has been fully committed in one direction, to incentivize unwinding rather than on-chain rebalancing. Overall, while exploring specific applications of lightning to the electricity markets is an opportunity for collaborative and complimentary work that could boost lightning adoption, it is important to be careful not to distract the lightning project from its already ambitious and laudable mission. Lightning must beware scope creep of a harmful sort, and it should still walk before it runs.</p>
