    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Olaoluwa Osuntokun, the latter invited Cezary to make an issue on lnd's issue tracker, stating that it is not the place for support requests/features for individual implementations. Cezary had previously made an issue five days ago which was initially interpreted as a bug filing but later updated by Johan to reflect that it is a feature request. Cezary also asked if Lightning Labs have plans to introduce this feature soon, preferring to stay with lnd if possible. Rusty Russell responded to a thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, noting that currently c-lightning can pay amountless invoices via the "pay" command but cannot create them via the c-lightning "invoice" command, and filed an issue for this. He also suggested using a magic string in the "msatoshi" field instead of omitting it altogether, as it is too easy for a bug to occur.</p>
