    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user expressed their preference to stay with Lightning Labs' implementation, lnd, but inquired about whether c-lightning would introduce a feature soon. Specifically, they wanted to know if c-lightning would be able to create invoices via the "invoice" command, as it currently only allows for payment of amountless invoices through the "pay" command. Rusty Russell responded to this inquiry by acknowledging the issue and filing it on GitHub so that it wouldn't be lost. He also provided a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning via the "lightning-cli pay" command, but noted that he would prefer the "msatoshi" field to have a magic string instead of being omitted to avoid bugs.</p>
