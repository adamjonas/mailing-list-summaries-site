    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Benjamin Mord regarding annotations on a lightning transaction, Christian confirmed that there was a BOLT#6, although it was eventually retired in favor of DNS seeds and gossiping. Benjamin was impressed by the technical creativity applied to the extensibility aspect of the BOLTs. When asked about the use-case for the feature, Benjamin explained that the concept of source routing could lead to collaborations with intermediaries where flexible communication capabilities would be required or desirable. Christian suggested that adding information in the onion packet would be possible, wherein specific information can be given to every hop, allowing nodes to add annotations that can be read along the route. For example, one could specify the desired exchange rate in the onion. However, Christian pointed out that currently, the only piece of information kept constant along the entire route is the payment hash, but this will also be removed in order to further decorrelate hops of a payment and make it harder for forwarding nodes to collate hops into a route.</p>
