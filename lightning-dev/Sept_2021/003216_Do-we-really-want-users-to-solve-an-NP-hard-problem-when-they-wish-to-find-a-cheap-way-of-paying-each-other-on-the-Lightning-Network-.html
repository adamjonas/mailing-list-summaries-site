    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed algorithm for the Lightning Network is not necessarily "optimal" since there are many factors to balance, such as CLTV, feed, estimated failure probability, and fees. Heuristics are used to approximate what the user wants and balance these factors into a score that can be fed into a routing algorithm. However, there is no guarantee of convergence to a single solution, which may lead to nonconstructive disagreement between LN developers in the future. Additionally, this approach may make the job of node operators less predictable and be perceived as a loss of decentralization to the developers. Despite this, some argue that users should be able to solve an NP-hard problem if necessary, similar to how the program "apt-get install" solves an NP-hard problem every time it runs.</p>
