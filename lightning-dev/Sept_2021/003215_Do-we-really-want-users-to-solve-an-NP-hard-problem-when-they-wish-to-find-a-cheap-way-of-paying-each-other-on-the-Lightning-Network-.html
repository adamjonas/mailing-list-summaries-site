    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, a variant of Pickhardt-Richter payments is proposed that can adapt to the reality of the current network where base_fee > 0 is common but is biased against it. The idea involves using amountprop_fee + amountbase_fee/min_flow_size as a component of the cost function, where min_flow_size is a suitable quantization constant. This solution solves the problem of splitting flows into HTLCs and allows for finding min-cost flows easily. However, it could be less accurate for channels with a larger base_fee and smaller min_flow_size. Despite this, the solution is practical and can work well for most people. The software engineering side of implementing this solution would take time and effort in terms of unit tests, edge cases, code review, and implementation, especially for C-Lightning, which has its own set of problems.</p>
