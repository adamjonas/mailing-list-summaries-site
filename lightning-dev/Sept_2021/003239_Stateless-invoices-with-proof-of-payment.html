    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the possibility of implementing a "pay-for-signature" protocol using PTLCs to reduce payment confirmation to one round. However, it is revealed that this cannot work as signing requires an 'R' and setting up a pay-for-signature requires the sender to know an 'R' from the recipient. Furthermore, if a sender requests for an 'R' and then initiates a PTLC, it would be more efficient to simply request an invoice. The sender generating 'r' and 'R' would result in revealing the privkey 'a'. It is suggested that any secure single-round multisignature Schnorr scheme can be adapted for this problem. Another mechanism is suggested where the receiver knows two scalars A=a*G and B=b*G. To make a payment, the sender adds A+B and locks an outgoing PTLC to that point. The proof-of-payment is the sum a+b. If keyed to some data, then the sender makes a payment to the receiver using d*A + B and receives the scalar behind the above point: d*a + b. Despite knowledge of d, the sender cannot learn a or b, thus locking the proof-of-payment to a specific d.</p>
