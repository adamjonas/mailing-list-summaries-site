        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The discussion is centered around the suitability of Lightning Network (LN) and apt repositories in terms of centralization. While the maintainers of apt repositories try to avoid `Conflict`-ing packages, PPAs can cause cascades of conflicting packages. In contrast, Nix and Guix are good alternatives as they avoid the `Conflict` issue. However, LN is decentralized, making complete control over the network of packages difficult. The risk with LN is that a centralized curator may provide payment solutions, leading to the centralization of the network to such an extent that evicting them becomes challenging.A variant of Pickhardt-Richter payments was proposed to adapt to the current network where `base_fee > 0`. The solution involves using amountprop_fee + amountbase_fee/min_flow_size as a component of the cost function, where min_flow_size is a suitable quantization constant. The software engineering side of implementing this solution would take time and effort, especially for C-Lightning, which has its own set of problems. The proposed algorithm for the Lightning Network is not necessarily "optimal" since there are many factors to balance, such as CLTV, fees, and estimated failure probability calculated from node online percentages at-open liquidity.ZmnSCPxj cautions against accepting the premise that a proposed algorithm is "optimal." ZmnSCPxj suggests that it may be possible to translate these considerations into a single unit of measurement: the millisatoshi. ZmnSCPxj proposes a variant of Pickhardt-Richter payments as a bridge from the current Lightning Network with base fee to a future with zero base fee. This variant can be created by adapting the cost function through the use of amountprop_fee and amountbase_fee/min_flow_size, where min_flow_size is a suitable quantization constant. The resulting function is convex and easy to find min-cost flows for it.In an email conversation between Rene Pickhardt and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed the possibility of users having to solve an NP-hard problem when they want to find a cheap way of paying each other on the Lightning Network. ZmnSCPxj suggested a routing method for Lightning Network that considers itself as routing on log(N) different networks and splitting payment if it fails. He also proposed a variant of Pickhardt-Richter payments that adapts to the reality of the current network where `base_fee > 0` is common, but is biased against `base_fee > 0`.</p>
