    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for Lightning Network to ask first before shooting an HTLC has been made. This replaces the current mechanism of shooting HTLCs first and then asking questions later, which requires multiple round trips per hop in case of failure along a route, with a single large round trip from the payer to the failure point. By allowing to ask first, the probability of HTLC failures due to a node or channel failing along the way is lessened, making it more palatable to charge for failing actual HTLCs. This improves payment latency and may be more advantageous as multipath payments become more common. However, this requires a whole-network upgrade, as intermediate nodes have to upgrade as well.</p>
