    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange on September 1, 2021, a user named ZmnSCPxj cautioned against accepting the premise that a proposed algorithm is "optimal." The algorithm in question was deemed optimal under a specific heuristic used to approximate what the user wants. However, in reality, there are a lot of different factors to consider such as CLTV, fees, and estimated failure probability calculated from node online percentages at-open liquidity. ZmnSCPxj suggested translating all these factors to a single unit such as millisatoshi, which is already being done in practice. However, this involves some heuristics on the part of the application developer. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for balancing competing costs, and different designs may lead to different score units. Thus, neither approach can be provably better than the other.</p>
