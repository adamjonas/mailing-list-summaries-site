    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Lightning Network developer has suggested creating DNS records for LN nodes to improve usability. Currently, users can shove data into DNS records and confirm from there, but standardization through a bLIP would ensure everyone does it the same way. The proposed format would allow assigning an alternate host name for the LN node for a domain, like an MX record, and storing the pubkey for the LN node in a DNS record. This would enable someone wanting to open a channel in advance to a company's LN node to find the information and make a connection using the familiar ybRK9h6OYmB3I4VroZBQogIadciFTw at ln.example.com format. The proposed format could be particularly useful when dealing with machines in the physical world where a human-readable string is printed on the machine, but QR codes or NFC are not available. Currently, host names associated with LN nodes found using peer-to-peer gossip are more on the honor system, but these proposed records could validate the information found using the peer-to-peer gossip protocol. Although the DNS root servers are governed by a centralized entity, this approach could complement the peer-to-peer gossip protocol, and DNS's hierarchically distributed nature may be more efficient long-term than every user having a full view of the LN via the gossip protocol to find needed information. The proposed format's definition could fit better in lnurl-rfc or as part of a BOLT.</p>
