    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author is proposing the creation of DNS records that can be used to serve the same information as the @host format for defining a connection to a LN node. These records would allow for alternate host names and storing the pubkey for the LN node in a DNS record. This could be particularly useful when dealing with machines in the physical world where an easy way to make a connection and channel with a human-readable string is needed. The current host names associated with LN nodes are found using the peer-to-peer gossip system which is on the honor system, but these new DNS records would validate the information found using the peer-to-peer gossip protocol. While this approach has its flaws due to the centralized nature of DNS root servers, it could be complimentary to the peer-to-peer gossip protocol and more efficient long-term. The author also questions if this definition fits better in lnurl-rfc or as part of a BOLT. Overall, this proposal aims to provide an easier and more reliable way to connect to LN nodes.</p>
