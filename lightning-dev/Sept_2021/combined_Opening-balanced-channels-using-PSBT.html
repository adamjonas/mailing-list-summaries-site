        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Ole Henrik Skogstrøm has discovered a method of opening balanced channels using LND's psbt option. This involves joining funded PSBTs before signing and submitting them, allowing for the opening of balanced channels between nodes or a ring of balanced channels between multiple nodes. However, Ole is unsure if this method is safe. Collaborating with other nodes and automating the process through a client is recommended for efficiency.Olaoluwa Osuntokun responds to Ole's message by explaining that out-of-band transaction construction and the push_amt feature in the base funding protocol can be used to simulate dual funded channels. He mentions that the 'balanceofsatoshis' tool has a command called 'open-balanced-channel' that simplifies the interaction. Osuntokun also notes that the balanced-ness of a channel is temporary, and if fees and channel policies are not set accordingly, normal payments or balance flows may shift the channel away from equilibrium shortly after it is opened.Lightning Pool uses a trick to allow users to purchase 50/50 balanced channels and channel leases for third parties (sidecar channels) to assist with onboarding onto Lightning. Osuntokun explains that Lightning Pool's process can be automatically batched with other channels created in that epoch, using the traits of the Pool account system to ensure atomicity. However, he cautions that when doing the process manually, lnd will only lock the UTXOs allocated for the funding attempt for a few minutes. It is crucial to finalize the process within that interval to avoid unlocking the UTXOs and risking accidental double spending.Ole Henrik Skogstrøm responds to Olaoluwa Osuntokun, expressing gratitude for his reply and acknowledging that opening balanced channels simplifies things for new routing nodes. He appreciates not having to balance them out through fee adjustments, considering that most channels are lopsided. However, he admits that he needs to learn more about this method.Bastien TEINTURIER responds to Ole Henrik's email and informs him that the dual funding proposal provides exactly what he was looking for. He shares a link to the proposal on Github, which can further assist Ole in understanding and implementing the concept of opening balanced channels.In summary, Ole Henrik Skogstrøm has discovered a method of opening balanced channels using LND's psbt option. Collaborating with other nodes and automating the process through a client is recommended for efficiency. Olaoluwa Osuntokun explains the temporary nature of channel balanced-ness and cautions about setting fees and channel policies correctly. Lightning Pool also utilizes a trick to purchase balanced channels and channel leases. Ole expresses gratitude and acknowledges the simplification this method brings, while admitting the need to learn more. Bastien TEINTURIER suggests the dual funding proposal as a solution and provides a link for further information.</p>
