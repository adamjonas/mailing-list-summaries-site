        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network (LN), a payment protocol designed to promote faster and more affordable transactions on the Bitcoin network, is vulnerable to payment correlation attacks. Such attacks allow adversaries to link the sender and receiver of a payment by monitoring traffic on the payment path. Centralized networks are more prone to these attacks than well-distributed networks. The LN payment correlations in order of severity are hash correlation, amount correlation, CLTV correlation, and timing correlation. Solutions to these vulnerabilities are being developed. Payment hash correlation is expected to be fixed with point time lock contracts (PTLCs). Splitting the payment amount into predefined values can decrease sub-path payment amount correlation, increasing anonymity set. Probabilistic Truncated Timelocks (PTLC) can also help minimize the probability of successful attacks and increase payment privacy when using the Payment Pointers (PP) protocol. It is important to minimize the probability of success for each attack to ensure the highest possible payment privacy. Further information on PTLC can be found at [1], and the topic has been discussed further in the Lightning-dev mailing list, as seen in [2].</p>
