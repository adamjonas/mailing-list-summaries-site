    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation begins with a request to explain the benefits of continuous solutions over binary. The writer wants to understand this before going in a more complicated direction. The second part of the conversation is related to rational behavior when reporting c truthfully. Thomas Huet responds to the first part by saying that giving high confidence to HTLCs increases the chance that they are relayed, which should be the goal. A high reputation is not a goal in itself, but a way to make HTLCs more likely to be relayed. If always reported as confidence 0, then the reputation would be one, but HTLCs would still be rejected at the first sign of congestion.In response to Thomas's example, Clara Shikhelman asks if there is anything to gain from giving high confidence. She suggests that by doing so, the node risks lowering its reputation, and it's not clear what is being gained. Clara wonders if the best selfish strategy is to report confidence 0 all the time, which maps to reputation 1.</p>
