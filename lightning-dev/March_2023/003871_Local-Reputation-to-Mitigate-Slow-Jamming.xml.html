    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a neighbor reputation setting recommendation as a jamming mitigation has been presented by Clara Shikhelman. The proposed solution aims to prevent full access to liquidity and slots in a channel that can result in jamming. The solution includes upfront fees together with reputation. Reputation-based forwarding is aimed at solving "slow jamming" where the jamming transaction takes a long time to resolve. Each node gives a binary reputation to its neighbor, and each channel has a quota of liquidity and slots dedicated to transactions coming from neighbors with reputation 0 or for transactions coming from neighbors with reputation 1 that were not endorsed by the neighbor.The main parameters for reputation that each node operator picks are S,L, and M, and recommendations suggest that S should be chosen as the maximum time an HTLC can be unresolved in any of Bob's channels. M is the revenue generated by Bob's node in the time S, representing the damage Alice could inflict, and L is the time in which Alice should generate M revenue for Bob for her to have a good reputation of 1. Alice has reputation 1 if, in the last L seconds, she has forwarded payments that generated M satoshi in fees.The reputation management happens locally, and the only protocol change needed is the ability to signal endorsement as a TLV in UpdateAddHTLC. The proposed formula treats all scores as continuous values between 0 and 1 instead of binary classes. The advantage of using more bits is that we can be more precise in which HTLCs we reject and reduce the number of innocent casualties.</p>
