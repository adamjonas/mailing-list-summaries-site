    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Clara Shikhelman asked for an explanation of the benefits of continuous solutions over binary. Thomas Huet explained that with a continuous solution, one can differentiate between an active attacker and someone who just sends to nodes with poor connectivity and only block the first. This is more precise than a binary solution, where a single attacker can easily fill your quota of low-confidence HTLCs and then all low-reputation nodes are blocked. However, if you report c truthfully too high or too low, there are penalties. Reporting it too high will lower your reputation, while reporting it too low penalizes your HTLCs. Clara was still not sure about whether the rational behavior is to report c truthfully. Thomas explained that giving a high confidence to HTLCs increases the chance that they are relayed, which should be the goal. Having a high reputation is not a goal in itself but a way to make HTLCs more likely to be relayed. If one always reports confidence 0, then their reputation will be 1, but their HTLCs will still be rejected at the first sign of congestion. Clara asked if there is anything to gain from giving high confidence because doing this risks lowering the reputation without any clear gain. She wondered if the best selfish strategy is to report confidence 0 all the time.</p>
