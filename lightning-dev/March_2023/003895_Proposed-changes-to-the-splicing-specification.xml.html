    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network developers have announced changes to the splicing protocol which will make it simpler and more robust. Splicing is a complex feature in which active commitments are made to valid commitment transactions, and updates can be applied to these as necessary. The new protocol will send one `commitment_signed` message per active commitment, in the order that funding transactions were created. Once a new splice is negotiated and interactive-tx protocol signing steps have been taken, a single `commitment_signed` is sent for the new commitment, without revoking previous commitments. This is conceptually the addition of a new commitment to the active commitments set. To ensure safe handling of disconnection scenarios, nodes must store data about the funding transaction as soon as they send their `commitment_signed` message. Funding amounts exchanged in `splice_init` and `splice_ack` should be relative amounts based on each peer's current channel balance. Implementing 0-conf splicing is tricky and can lead to vulnerabilities, so the developers are interested in discussing this further. More details and sample flows can be found at [2].</p>
