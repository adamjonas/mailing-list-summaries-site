    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been put forth to prevent jamming in Lightning Network transactions. The solution includes upfront fees and reputation-based forwarding, the latter of which aims to solve "slow jamming". Each node gives a binary reputation to its neighbor, and each channel has a quota of liquidity and slots dedicated to transactions. Alice gains and keeps her good reputation of 1 by continuously paying more fees to Bob than the damage she can inflict. Three main parameters for reputation are suggested: S, L, and M. Alice has a reputation of 1 if, in the last L seconds, she has forwarded payments that generated M satoshi in fees. The proposal suggests normalizing fees by resolution time to reward payments that resolve quickly and discount slow resolving payments.The fee from a single transaction is normalized by the time it took for the HTLC to resolve, counted in slots of 10 seconds. The reputation management happens locally, and only the ability to signal endorsement as a TLV in UpdateAddHTLC is needed. The proposed formula treats all scores as continuous values between 0 and 1 instead of binary classes, whereby a node that sends the same confidence c for all HTLCs is expected to have c equal to the probability p that its HTLCs succeed. If c > p, then this node is overconfident or lying to relay its HTLCs, and its reputation should be lowered. The proposal is compatible with other proposals, and the advantage of using more bits is that we can be more precise in which HTLCs we reject and reduce the number of innocent casualties.The Lightning-dev mailing list is a forum for discussing the development of the Lightning Network, a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin. The mailing list can be accessed via the email address lightning-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org or through the associated website lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev. The Lightning Network is designed to enable faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions by using off-chain payment channels that are secured by the underlying Bitcoin blockchain. Developers use the mailing list to share ideas, discuss technical issues, and coordinate efforts related to the ongoing development of the Lightning Network. Anyone interested in contributing to the development of the Lightning Network is welcome to join the mailing list.</p>
