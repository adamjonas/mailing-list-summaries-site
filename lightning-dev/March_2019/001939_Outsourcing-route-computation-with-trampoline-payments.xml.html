    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A new "Multi-frame sphinx onion format" has been suggested for trustlessly outsourcing the computation of payment routes. The format would allow users to send payments to an intermediate node, who would then find a route to the final destination and make the payment on their behalf. This could reduce the load on sending nodes in terms of memory, bandwidth, and CPU usage. Intermediate nodes would earn fees for participating in the routing process, creating an incentive for them to cooperate. However, fee computation would have to be pessimistic. The use of trampoline hops would also ensure privacy characteristics are maintained. The "Multi-frame sphinx onion format" can be found at the link provided.</p>
