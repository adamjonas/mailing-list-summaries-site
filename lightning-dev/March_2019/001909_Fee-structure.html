    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context of the message is a clarification by John-John Markstedt in response to an earlier discussion with ZmnSCPxj and Andrea. John-John clarifies that he agrees with both their arguments and now understands why the idea in question doesn't make sense in terms of scale and privacy. The initial point made by John-John was that the fee would be higher for every satoshi used closer to the far end of the channel, but ZmnSCPxj pointed out that the final state of the channel has a subtractive relationship from the payment size. John-John acknowledges that they were talking past each other and clarifies that he wasn't trying to argue, just seeking clarification.</p>
