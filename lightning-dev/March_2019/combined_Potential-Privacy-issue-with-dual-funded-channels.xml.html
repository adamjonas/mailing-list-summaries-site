        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is facing concerns about the privacy of nodes providing liquidity in dual funded channels. René Pickhardt raised the issue on the Lightning-dev mailing list, citing the possibility of an attacker probing a lower bound for the amount of Bitcoin available by a node that supports dual funded channels. The suggested solutions include returning a non-specific error message, adding a privately held randomization vector, and adjusting the opening channel balance to reflect the correct amount of push_msat for the actual amount of funding_satoshi contributed by the accepter.Other solutions proposed include rate limiting the number of open channel requests accepted from a single peer or globally, setting a policy around what a node considers reasonable liquidity requests from a peer, and establishing channels via out-of-band negotiation with trusted node operators. However, preserving the privacy of funds remains optional.One proposal for advertising channel liquidity suggested modifying the 'open_channel' message to include an option for liquidity buy and amount of dual funding requested at channel open. This could allow a lower bound for the amount of BTC available by a node that allows for dual funded channels to be probed through internet traffic. The author suggests making spamming/probing more expensive, possibly through requiring a person to open a channel first and then splice something in, or identifying requests to splice in and allowing the person being probed to fail the channel.During a spec meeting, the topic of dual funded channels and potential game theory with fees was discussed, but the privacy of the node providing liquidity was not addressed. Off-chain settlement protocols based on Schnorr signatures have also been proposed as a solution to tackle privacy and liquidity issues, allowing a variety of funding combinations and offline transactions with a trusted oracle, with optional blinding of data from the oracle's point of view for optimal privacy. While no concrete solution has been proposed, it is worth noting the problem with privacy for dual funded channels, as the Lightning Network prioritizes strong privacy for its users.</p>
