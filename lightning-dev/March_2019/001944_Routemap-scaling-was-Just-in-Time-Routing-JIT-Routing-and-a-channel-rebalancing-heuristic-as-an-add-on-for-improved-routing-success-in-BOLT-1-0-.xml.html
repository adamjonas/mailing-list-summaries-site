    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, René Pickhardt raises a question about how nodes can determine the distance from themselves without knowing the entire network topology. ZmnSCPxj suggests that one possible solution is to use a pruned view of the network and query for a certain depth by using the `query ask egonetwork` command. However, René raises another point about pruning channels with low capacity in the routemap memory when it becomes close to full. ZmnSCPxj proposes that instead of deterministic pruning, probabilistic pruning could be made more effective by modifying the pruning rule to include a node's distance from itself in addition to channel capacity. This way, everyone would have a different set of channels while still being likely to track their friend-of-friend network compared to more distant nodes.</p>
