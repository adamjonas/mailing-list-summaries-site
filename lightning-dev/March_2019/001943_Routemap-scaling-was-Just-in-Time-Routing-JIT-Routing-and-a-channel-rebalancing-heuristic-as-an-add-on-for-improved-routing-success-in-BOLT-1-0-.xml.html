    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email to fellow lightning developers, Ren√© Pickhardt has suggested a new gossip message for the network and pointed out that it is good to keep channels with large capacity in the routemap. He proposed to delete channels with low capacity when the routemap memory is becoming close to full but make that process probabilistic rather than deterministic. ZmnSCPxj, a software engineer, raised concerns about testing such probabilistic code and instead suggested modifying the pruning rule to include distance from self in addition to channel capacity. The nearer the channel, the more likely it is retained, and the larger the channel, the more likely it is retained. However, determinism may be difficult to achieve as the pruning itself would affect the distance of the channel to the "self" node. ZmnSCPxj also recommended that every node should always track their friend-of-friend network.</p>
