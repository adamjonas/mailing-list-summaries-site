    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The lightning network is a platform for fast and cheap transactions of bitcoin. The context describes a solution for rebalancing channels in the lightning network, called Just-In-Time routing (JIT Routing). Nodes in the network can use rebalancing to ensure that there is enough capacity available to route payments. Traditional rebalancing requires a lot of computation and can trigger another JIT operation at another node. Just-In-Time routing solves this by allowing nodes to rebalance only when they receive an onion that they cannot forward because of insufficient capacity. The sender of the onion starts with larger cltv_deltas to allow routing nodes to have some buffer.In a post on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Ren√© Pickhardt introduces the Just in Time Routing schema (JIT Routing) as a way to mitigate the disadvantages from current source-based routing. JIT Routing makes the routing process more like best effort routing that we know from IP-forwarding and does not decrease the privacy of nodes. Part of JIT Routing requires nodes to be able to quickly rebalance their channels; thus, Pickhardt also proposes a heuristic for doing this efficiently which he implemented and seems to provide pretty good results. The author of the context has been working on a c-lightning plugin for rebalancing over the weekend. He uses a promising heuristic for rebalancing where he looks at the friend of a friend network of the node that wants to rebalance channels. This network consists of all channel partners of the node and their channels. The advantages of JIT Routing are that it is possible to do now without any protocol modification, routing nodes can already easily implement it and increase routing success even for nodes running older implementations, it seems to be logically equivalent to AMP Routing, and local channel balance information along the route can now be part of the pathfinding process while not decreasing the privacy by sharing information about channel balances with others. However, the disadvantages include the fact that it might economically not be incentivized for a routing node in every situation and the routing process might take a longer time as it starts sub-routing processes.After pruning nodes with degree 1, which can't be used to rebalance on this subgraph, we have a pretty small network. After extracting this subnetwork, the computation to suggest several hundred rebalancing cycles and even ordering them by price takes less than 1 second on his machine. The author plans to release the code for the rebalancing schema soon but wanted to have the idea already out in order to get more feedback while working on this.While doing JIT routing, the capacity for channels should be reserved even before HTLCs are set up to prevent hostile recursive chains of rebalancing operations. Additionally, the lack of a global view can lead to complicated HTLC networks forming and ultimately still lead to payment failure. Pickhardt provides an example of JIT Routing in practice using a graph with four nodes and outlines how JIT Routing could resolve a liquidity problem where a single route cannot forward the full payment. With the above recommendation in place, the intermediary node can create a different onion with moving funds between channels to allow the payment to go through. Although it is S who must still guess how the problems with liquidity arise since they do not know how the intermediary has spread its funds between channels, JIT Routing can help address some of the issues with source-based routing. Finally, Pickhardt concludes that it may still be valuable to try JIT Routing, though it will massively increase complexity in c-lightning, and a small network of such nodes should be evaluated on mainnet LN to see how often rebalance failures occur.</p>
