    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, the rule for determining when a rebalancing operation would be beneficial to a node is discussed. The node receives an offered fee amount for forwarding but may have to fail and earn no fees under current channel states. If the node engages in JIT-routing, it may have to pay a rebalancing fee amount, and even if it forwards successfully, there is still a chance of earning zero fees if the route fails. To determine whether JIT-routing is worthwhile, the probability of success (success_rate) must be considered, which is a value between 0 and 1.0. JIT-routing should only be engaged in if the offered_fee_amount multiplied by the success_rate minus the rebalancing_fee_amount is greater than zero. The expected earning is represented by the left-hand side of the subtraction, while the right-hand side represents the expected cost, making it easy to determine net earnings. The fee amounts are easily computed, and the rebalancing code can provide the rebalancing_fee_amount for a particular rebalance path. The success_rate can be computed statically from some node data, with the node augmenting this information over time with its own experienced success_rates for all forwards.</p>
