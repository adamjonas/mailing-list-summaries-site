    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of the context is suggesting that the current fee structure may be problematic due to the lack of inherent incentives for balanced channels. While there are more pressing problems to address, the author proposes a formalized and implementable proposal which would run simulations to verify its impact on throughput and robustness. Currently, fees are only proportional to liquidity used, not the state of the channel. The author explains the problem with this using an example where two payments use the same amount of liquidity but start from different initial states. The fees for both payments would be the same but would leave the channels in completely different states. To address this issue, the author suggests a scheme of brackets where each satoshi in the channel would have a different price bracket. The channels would then broadcast a cost function instead of a fixed fee. The fees for payments would be much different under this method and incentivize payments to route in a way to keep channels balanced, leading to higher throughput. However, the author notes that this approach may be unnecessarily complex and require deterministic ways to calculate integrals over multiple systems, and there may be better solutions to the problem.</p>
