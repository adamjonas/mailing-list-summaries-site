    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Lightning Network's routing infrastructure, it was proposed that public nodes could advertise aggregate-channels, which would allow for more abstract network connections and reduce the burden of keeping up-to-date network information. However, non-existent channels are not safe to propagate on the network as they can be spammed easily. To reduce resource usage of large routemaps, a pruning heuristic based on channel capacity was suggested. This would involve deleting channels with low capacity when the routemap memory is becoming full. The proposal to replace aggregate-channels with high-capacity channels was put forward, with such channels being more likely to successfully route a payment than smaller channels. Nodes would still need to track their direct channels, but payee nodes could also provide 'r' routes in BOLT1 invoices from nodes with high-capacity channels to ensure payment can still be made even if intermediate channels are pruned due to low capacity.</p>
