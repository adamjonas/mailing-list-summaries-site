        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community is exploring ways to add or remove liquidity from channels without closing them, a process known as splicing. Several proposals have been discussed, including creating parallel funding transactions that can be merged at an agreed depth and pre-seating inputs to generate addresses that can be spliced directly into the channel. However, safety concerns exist with these approaches without trust in the other peer. Rusty Russell proposed a new protocol that treats splice-in and splice-out differently and does not require any wait time. The network also considers modifications to the `revoke_and_ack` or `channel_reestablish` messages, allowing remote nodes to locate the spliced channel even if it’s not populated in indexes containing active channels.One proposed approach involves lifting from the multiple funding output approach the "pre-seating of inputs" as it would allow for splicing of funds without needing to modify the revoke_and_ack or channel_reestablish messages. However, concerns about the safety of this approach without trust in the other peer can be solved by using a Taproot address that reveals the script it commits to, which is just a time-locked refund that requires a single signature.Another proposal suggests sending two revocation points for the new commitment when allowing updates to proceed immediately after signing, and using CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) to anchor down splicing transactions. ZmnSCPxj expresses concern about doing away with the initiator distinction in certain actions. Olaoluwa Osuntokun discusses the benefits of creating multiple channels, while Christian Decker has a different opinion on the need to create multiple channels to a single peer or increase capacity with a specific peer.René Pickhardt proposes a new method for splicing in and out of Lightning Network channels, allowing users to combine two existing payment channels into one or divide one channel into two. The proposal involves three types of splicing negotiations, with a post-splice reserve of 1% of post-splice capacity, which should be re-negotiated at the time of splice creation. The fees for the splicing transaction itself are divided into parts by the number of splice_add_input plus splice_add_output, rounded up.Although Rusty initially proposed parallel splice as a method for splicing, it was found that it does not work with Poon-Dryja channels as the counterparty can spend the old funding transaction output with a revoked spend. Despite various workarounds being suggested, none were deemed suitable, and the conversation ended with Rusty returning to Plan A.Overall, the Lightning Network community is exploring various approaches to splicing channels with desired properties such as non-blocking usage of the channel, a single on-chain transaction, and the ability to RBF. Developers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of resetting the revocation sequence post-splice, but ultimately decide against it due to the current atomicity perspective. Finally, scalability issues with increasing the maximum values of these parameters are considered.</p>
