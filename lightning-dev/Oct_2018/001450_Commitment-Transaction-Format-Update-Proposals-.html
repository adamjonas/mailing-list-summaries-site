    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email exchange between Rusty Russell and ZmnSCPxj discusses a proposal to use an OP_TRUE-style output to allow CPFP, which would require some base-layer changes at the Bitcoin level. ZmnSCPxj suggests that this would require minimum IsStandard() modification and possibly a consensus rule that OP_TRUE would not be spendable beyond the block it appears in to reduce UTXO database size at a lower layer. Rusty Russell clarifies that the proposal is actually a P2WSH to "OP_TRUE" and works today but may change if the luke-jr proposal pushes through. ZmnSCPxj also raises concerns about potential robots claiming as many OP_TRUE outputs as they can find during very-low-fee periods and wonders about the rationale for the original asymmetric design of the CLTV timeout. Rusty Russell explains that the original design does the minimum necessary, but when combined with fee asymmetry, it can lead to one side not caring whether it forces the other to perform a unilateral or does a graceful mutual close. He suggests that aligning incentives (to mutual close) makes sense if they are changing other things. Overall, the email exchange discusses minor improvements to the Bitcoin network.</p>
