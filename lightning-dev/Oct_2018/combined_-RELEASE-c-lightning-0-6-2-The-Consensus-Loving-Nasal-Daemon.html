It also incorporates the advertising of htlc_maximum_msat for channels, in accordance with a recent BOLT update. Internally, significant optimizations have been made in JSON command response. Moreover, connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort.The latest release of c-lightning 0.6.2 recognizes contributions from 13 different authors, including three first-time c-lightning contributors.
