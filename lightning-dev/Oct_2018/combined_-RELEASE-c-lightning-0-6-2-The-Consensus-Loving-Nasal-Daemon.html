        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The developers of c-lightning have announced the release of version 0.6.2, which includes several improvements for users and the overall network health. For instance, invoices now contain hints on good incoming channels to use for more reliable payments, while the listforwards command can show all forwarded HTLCs and getinfo shows total fees. Furthermore, redundant gossip updates are completely eliminated, and dead channels are no longer spammed by peers. The new version also comes with a multitude of bugfixes that improve overall user experience. Internally, there were significant optimization in JSON command response and connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort. The c-lightning team highly recommends upgrading to this release as it will improve the network's overall health. Additionally, they are grateful for all the bug reports and suggestions, acknowledging the contributions of 13 different authors, including three first-time contributors. More information about the update can be found in the CHANGELOG.</p>
