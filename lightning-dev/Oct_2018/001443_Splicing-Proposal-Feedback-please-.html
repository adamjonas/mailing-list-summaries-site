    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the Lightning Network, one participant suggests that a simpler solution be preferred, although they note that splice should still be considered important. The simpler solution would result in more transactions on-chain but reduce complexity in maintaining parallel state updates. However, the same line of thinking led to on-chain transaction bloat in the past. Splicing features could be versioned, with the possibility of better mechanisms being defined in later BOLT specs. This would allow for iteration and starting with a simpler splicev1 feature, which could be replaced by a more thought-out splicev2 feature with parallel updates and careful analysis of possible failures and recovery methods. Although this could result in further complexity later on, it may be possible to eventually stop signalling older splicing feature versions in favor of newer ones if completely separate feature bits are assigned.</p>
