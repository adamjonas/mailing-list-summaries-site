        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Margherita Favaretto, a master's student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark, wrote to the Lightning-dev group seeking feedback on her research, which aims to mitigate the problem of false positives for double spend attacks on the Lightning Network. However, it was pointed out that double-spending is not an attack that can be performed solely on the Lightning Network and nodes are not being banned because of this. The solution proposed by Margherita is called a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol, which wants to solve the identification of a false positive, communication to other nodes, and the remediation payments mechanism. Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa suggested studying Eltoo as a solution. Margherita confirmed that her solution aims to keep the remediation inside the Lightning network to avoid time and cost of an additional on-chain transaction. It was also mentioned that there are no possible double-spend attacks on the Lightning Network, and the other end of the channel would lose money if they agree to double-spending. Suggestions were made to focus on an atomic multipath protocol that supports contingent payment (pay for secret) protocol or trustless watchtowers. If the inadvertent publication of revoked commitment transactions is the problem, then the correct solution would be to use eltoo instead of implementing "trusted remediation".</p>
