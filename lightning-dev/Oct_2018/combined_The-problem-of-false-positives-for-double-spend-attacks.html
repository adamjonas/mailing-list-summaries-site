        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Margherita Favaretto, a Master student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is currently in San Francisco to advance her academic research on the Lightning Network. Her research project focuses on developing a remediation protocol for double-spend attacks within the network. She aims to address the issue of false positives, which includes both software errors and malicious nodes that should be excluded from the network.To achieve this, Favaretto proposes a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol. This protocol would identify false positives, communicate them to other nodes, and initiate the remediation payments mechanism. In order to refine her research and seek collaboration opportunities, she reached out to the Lightning-dev group for feedback and open discussions about her assumptions and related work.In response to Favaretto's email, Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa clarified that double-spending is not an attack that can be solely performed on the Lightning Network. He also mentioned that there are no nodes being banned due to double-spending. However, he was unsure if nodes were being banned for tampering or sending incorrect information on the peer-to-peer Lightning Network.Another individual named AmkG responded to Favaretto's research proposal, suggesting that the focus should be shifted towards other areas such as an atomic multipath protocol that supports contingent payment or trustless watchtowers. They also highlighted the potential solution of using eltoo, which eliminates the need for revocable transactions and could potentially solve the problem before the implementation of the proposed "trusted remediation" protocol.Despite these differing opinions, Margherita Favaretto remains committed to her research on the Lightning Network remediation protocol. She seeks open feedback and collaboration opportunities with interested individuals, aiming to contribute to the project as an independent researcher. Additionally, she is open to possible collaborations outside the scope of her current research topic for those interested in this area of study.</p>
