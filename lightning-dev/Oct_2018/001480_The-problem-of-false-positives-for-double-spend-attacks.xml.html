    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Margherita Favaretto, a Master student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), reached out to the Lightning-dev group for feedback on her research. Her project focuses on a remediation protocol for Lightning Network double-spend attacks, specifically mitigating the problem of false positives such as software errors. She has proposed a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol to solve the issue. Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa responded to her email and asked for clarification on what she meant by double-spend attacks, stating that a double-spend is not an attack that can be performed solely on the Lightning Network. Margherita thanked Alejandro for his response and mentioned that she is studying Eltoo as a potential solution to the issue and is interested in the possibilities provided by contingent payments. She aims to keep the remediation within the Lightning network to avoid additional time and cost of an on-chain transaction.</p>
