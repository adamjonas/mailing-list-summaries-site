    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation is about a splicing protocol for Lightning Network channels. The proposed protocol involves old and new funding outputs, old and new commitment transactions, and spliced inputs that are wholly controlled by one party. The Splice Preparation Protocol has five steps to be followed before the confirmation of the splice. During the splice, commitment transactions can only be updated in parallel, and each side can only use money allocated for the splice to offer HTLCs. Failure modes are also discussed, with two possible scenarios - one where the splicing transaction becomes invalid from the mempool, and the other where the channel closes due to spend of the old commitment transaction or timing out without seeing the splicing transaction getting invalidated. In case of the failure of splicing transaction, both sides can drop the added money and revert to the pre-splice channel. Finally, Rusty suggests an alternative approach to the current proposal which is based on inline splice-in and would not require this protocol at all.</p>
