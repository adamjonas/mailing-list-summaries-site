    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Fabrice, they discussed the possibility of reducing the synchronization problem using set reconciliation algorithms. They suggest that if they consider the timestamp and enable/disable state of channel updates as part of an item, they can use standard set reconciliation algorithms. For channel updates of the same short channel ID, they can drop all items except the one with the latest timestamp. This idea might be less efficient than Zmn's proposed extension. However, Fabrice believes that this would be a natural solution to handle sync issues, as it is done in different contexts. Fabrice also raises the concern that they may have missed something with the current channel queries. He proposes something that is close to what they already have today, should be easy to implement if channel queries are already supported, and should fix the issue he thinks they have. The conversation ends with Fabrice asking for others' opinions on his proposal.</p>
