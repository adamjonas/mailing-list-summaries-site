        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell has announced the release of c-lightning 0.6.2, which is now available on GitHub and will soon be on launchpad.net. This release is technically at -rc1, but there is no difference from the previous release except for the tag and CHANGELOG.md change. Users are recommended to upgrade to improve overall network health. The latest release includes several highlights for c-lightning users, including route boost in invoices, listforwards command, and reduced logging spam at debug level. A multitude of bug fixes have been made. For the network, improvements include no more spamming of peers with dead channels, elimination of redundant gossip updates, and advertising htlc_maximum_msat for channels, as per recent BOLT update. Internally, there have been significant optimizations in JSON command response, while connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort. The latest release also acknowledges contributions from 13 different authors, three of whom were first-time c-lightning contributors, with 239 commits made since the last release. The complete changelog can be found on the GitHub page.</p>
