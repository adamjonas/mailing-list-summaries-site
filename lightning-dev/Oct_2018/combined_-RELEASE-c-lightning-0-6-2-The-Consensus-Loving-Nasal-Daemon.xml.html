        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The c-lightning 0.6.2 has been released, and users are recommended to upgrade for better network health. The release includes features like route boost in invoices, reduced logging spam at debug level, and the listforwards command. Bug fixes have also been made to improve user experience. Network improvements include no more spamming of peers with dead channels, elimination of redundant gossip updates, and advertising htlc_maximum_msat for channels as per recent BOLT update. Significant optimizations have been made in JSON command response, while connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort. Contributions from 13 different authors have been acknowledged, with 239 commits made since the last release. The complete changelog is available on the Github page. Rusty Russell has released c-lightning 0.6.2 and it has been named by @practicalswift. The release can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.6.2">https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.6.2</a>. The release will soon be available on <a href="https://launchpad.net/">https://launchpad.net/</a>~cdecker/+archive/ubuntu/clightning, but for now, the correct link is <a href="https://launchpad.net/">https://launchpad.net/</a>~lightningnetwork/+archive/ubuntu/ppa. Though technically a -rc1 release, there is no difference except for the tag and CHANGELOG.md change. Rusty thanks those who have already upgraded to the new release.</p>
