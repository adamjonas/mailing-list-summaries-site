        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network faces challenges with pending payments, which can cause complaints from users. One solution proposed is to disconnect from a node that takes too long to send a revocation and reconnect immediately to the same node, allowing pending downstream Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to be forgotten and their corresponding upstream HTLCs to fail. Another possible solution is to use probing with short timeout requirements, sending a "blank" probe request along the same route before sending the actual payment. A "0 satoshi" payment request could also be generated by the receiving node along with the real one to check if all nodes on the route are alive and responsive before sending the actual payment.In an email conversation between Laolu and Fabrice, HORNET is suggested during the set-up phase of payments to allow the sender to determine whether the route is "lively" or not. Each node can use a private "fee function" that may take into account the level of congestion in their channels, and the ability to receive a protocol-level payment ACK may be useful when implementing AMP. The created circuits can be reused across several distinct payments, and each node no longer needs to maintain per-circuit state. Pierre questions whether HORNET would fully solve the problem as it operates at a lower layer and may not be able to handle cases where a peer is unresponsive but still has a valid circuit, and suggests disconnecting from nodes that take too long to send a revocation, proposing adding this suggestion to BOLT 2 as a "SHOULD" clause.</p>
