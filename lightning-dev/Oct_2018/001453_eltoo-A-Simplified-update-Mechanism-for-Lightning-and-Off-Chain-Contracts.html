    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network specification uses a penalty-based invalidation mechanism, but eltoo is a drop-in replacement for this. One issue with eltoo's locktime-based sequencing is that it limits the number of updates to 1 billion. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests an adaptive scheme in which a second update transaction is added at around 90% of the available range; this effectively creates a larger overall counter with 10^18 possible updates. Alternatively, Anthony Towns suggests always having two update transactions, creating a single counter with 10^18 possible updates, and rolling over to new update keys after using more than 1 billion updates on a channel. This would make unilateral closes more painful, but keep cooperative closes cheap. Christian Decker notes that he did not think 1 billion updates would be used anytime soon since splice-in/splice-out operations would lead to regular on-chain re-anchoring.</p>
