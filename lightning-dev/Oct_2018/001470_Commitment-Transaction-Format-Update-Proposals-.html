    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, there was a discussion on how to manage on-chain fees for commitment transactions. One proposal was to use an OP_TRUE-style output to allow Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) and avoid closing channels during spikes in on-chain fees. Another suggestion was to use SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE for HTLC transactions without adding the "OP_TRUE" output to the commitment transaction. However, this would require an available UTXO to make the CPFP. It was also noted that HTLC transactions with an absolute timeout won't be accepted in the mempool until the expiry has matured. Therefore, the commitment would have to be held until that time before its descendants can bump the fee rate. Additionally, it was proposed that the CLTV timeout should be symmetrical to avoid attempting to game the peer into closing. Overall, there were several suggestions put forth for managing fees in commitment transactions.</p>
