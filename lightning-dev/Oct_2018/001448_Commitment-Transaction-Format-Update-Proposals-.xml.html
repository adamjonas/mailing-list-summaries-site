    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion among Rusty and others, it was suggested that instead of agreeing on future fees, an OP_TRUE-style output should be used to allow for CPFP. However, this would require base-layer changes at the Bitcoin level, including modifying IsStandard() and implementing a consensus rule that OP_TRUE would only be spendable within the block it appears in. This may delay other parts of the proposal, but it's unclear if this is an issue.Another suggestion made during the discussion was to make the CLTV timeout symmetric to avoid gaming peers into closing. The rationale for the original asymmetric design and the new symmetric design were questioned.</p>
