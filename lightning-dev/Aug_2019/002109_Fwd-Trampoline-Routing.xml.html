    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between fiatjaf and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of privacy erosion in routing is discussed. Alice's decision to use multiple trampoline nodes in her routing process is explained as a way to reduce the chance of the trampoline node knowing who the final payee is. This is because if only one trampoline node is used, it can assume the next hop is always the payee and record that information, eroding privacy. The conversation then shifts to the idea of a future public network becoming too large to fit on most devices. Incentives for end-user nodes to publish their channels and store information hierarchically are discussed. ZmnSCPxj believes that a global map with just trampoline-payee association mappings and a myopic detailed channel map should be implemented, with each payer defining their own hierarchy or split. However, ZmnSCPxj also acknowledges the possibility that his ideas may be too indefinite and the network should be allowed to evolve naturally.</p>
