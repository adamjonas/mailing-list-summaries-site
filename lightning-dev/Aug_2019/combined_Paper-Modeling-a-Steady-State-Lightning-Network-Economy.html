        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The email writer is a passive observer in a Lightning Network mailing list who has experimented with running a node on mainnet and written a paper reflecting their mathematical explorations in a scenario where the Lightning Network has scaled to the size and volume of a self-sustained economy. In this "steady-state economy," the authors argue that there is a tendency towards a state where exactly n-1 channels have perfectly balanced flows in two directions while all other channels are either unused or have a permanent tendency towards imbalance. The paper also provides some practical lessons from this scenario and remarks on the more general case where nodes do not balance their income and expenses.The discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Gregorio is about the paper's argument that in a network of n connected nodes, there is a tendency towards a state where exactly n-1 channels have perfectly balanced flows in the two directions. These "self-balancing" channels form a spanning tree of the network graph, which is called the "core spanning tree" of the payment network. However, it is noted that no steady state will ever exist in practice since the shifting patterns of demand and supply in a dense web of channels will naturally cause agents to add traffic to channels that were previously not used, resulting in a continuous shift in equilibrium. The authors note that having many channels helps the general resilience and flexibility of the network. The worst-case scenario for this would be a single central hub with n-1 channels to n-1 client nodes, with the hub itself as the nth node. However, the minimum of n-1 channels would not remain stable for long given an actual real-world where change is the steady-state. In such situations, any "extra, unneeded" channels would end up catching the additional capacity need as various innovations and improvements in the economy occur and create change in demand and supply. Anyone interested in making something out of these ideas is welcome to do so.</p>
