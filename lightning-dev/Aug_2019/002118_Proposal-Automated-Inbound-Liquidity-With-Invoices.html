    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Ecurrencyhodler Blockchains discusses a scenario where Bob wants to send him 100,000 sats, but his node has just come online and has zero inbound liquidity. In response, Ecurrencyhodler Blockchains creates an invoice for 100,000 sats, which includes his URI due to the lack of inbound liquidity. Bob's wallet sees the invoice and attempts to route it, but since there is no channel available, it automatically opens a channel and sends the payment. Ecurrencyhodler Blockchains now owns 100,000 sats and can spend it instantly.However, if one publishes their node address, Bob can already access it through the gossip network or DNS seed as a last resort. Therefore, this proposal is mainly useful for those who do not have any channels or do not want to publish their node address generally. In these cases, Bob may not want a channel with them as it would not be useful for paying anyone else.</p>
