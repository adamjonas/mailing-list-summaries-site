    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Trampoline routing is a method of sending payments through trampoline nodes, allowing users to defer the calculation of the route to their chosen trampoline node. For example, Alice selects T1 and RT2 as trampoline hops to send a payment to Bob. When Alice routes a payment to T1, she puts the small trampoline onion in the payload for T1. Once T1 receives the payment, it forwards it to RT2, who further forwards the payment to Bob.However, Bastien TEINTURIER points out that by not syncing the whole network, Alice has to accept being in the dark for some decisions. Alice is merely hoping that RT2 can find a route to Bob. Despite this potential issue, trampoline routing is an engineering trade-off between ease of implementation and deployment, fixing a problem we have today and enabling future scaling for problems we'll have tomorrow. It is a first step towards enabling hierarchical/packet switched routing architecture, which will be required when the network becomes too large.In contrast, Bastien proposes the creation of a filter system similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 37 (BIP37). In this system, Alice sends gossip filters to her peers and only forwards updates that match these filters. However, unlike Bitcoin's BIP37, this system has a cost for Alice in the form of opening a channel and locking funds to connect to a peer. Nonetheless, Bastien's proposed filters are cheap to compute, either through a simple XOR or node distance comparison. Those interested in technical details can refer to [1].Bastien seeks feedback from the community on the concept's gossip and fee estimation parts. The proposal is available at <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/654">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/654</a>.</p>
