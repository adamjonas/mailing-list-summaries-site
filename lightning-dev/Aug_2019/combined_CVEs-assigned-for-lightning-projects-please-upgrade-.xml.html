        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A recent security alert has been issued for various lightning projects that have security issues which could lead to the loss of funds. The details regarding these issues will be released in four weeks' time, but users are urged to upgrade their systems beforehand. Some releases such as c-lightning, lnd, and eclair are affected by CVE, and users should upgrade to fully patched versions like lnd v0.7.1, c-lightning v0.7.1, and eclair v0.3.1 to avoid any risks of fund loss.It is important for users to keep in mind that there are still limits in place on the network to mitigate widespread funds loss. Therefore, users must remain cautious and consider this when putting funds onto the network at an early stage. In case users encounter any problems updating their implementation, developers can be contacted for assistance.Overall, it is essential for users to take action and upgrade their systems to ensure the safety of their funds. The network is still in its early stages, and precautions must be taken to prevent any potential losses.</p>
