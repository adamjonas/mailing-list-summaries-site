    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The authors argue that in a network of n connected nodes, there is a tendency towards a state where exactly n-1 channels have perfectly balanced flows in the two directions ("self-balancing" channels), while all other channels are either unused, or have a permanent tendency towards imbalance. They note that the "self-balancing" channels form a spanning tree of the network graph, which they call the "core spanning tree" of the payment network. The worst-case scenario for this would be a single central hub with n-1 channels to n-1 client nodes, with the hub itself as the nth node. However, the minimum of n-1 channels would not remain stable for long given an actual real-world where change is the steady-state. In such situations, any "extra, unneeded" channels would end up catching the additional capacity need as various innovations and improvements in the economy occur and create change in demand and supply.</p>
