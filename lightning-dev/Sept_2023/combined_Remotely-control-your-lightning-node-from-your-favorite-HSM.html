        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Bastien's email discusses the use of runes/macaroons for validating and authenticating commands. He questions the practicality of validating every RPC request with a hardware device and trusted display, unless there is a specific use case in mind.He mentions the commando plugin and explains that while it uses a lightning connection to send commands to a lightning node, it lacks the crucial aspect of having all of Bolt 8 handled by the HSM and validating commands using a trusted display. According to Bastien, this additional security measure does not compromise the user experience and enables secure remote control from a mobile phone.Zman responds to Bastien and points out that CLN already has something similar in its standard distribution. He provides a link to the documentation on the commando feature. However, he notes that it is specifically tied to the CLN command set.Bastien has submitted a pull request to the bLIPs repository to document an idea he has been investigating. The idea involves creating a simple architecture that allows for securely sending administrative commands to a lightning node from an untrusted machine. This is achieved by utilizing a hardware security module (HSM) as a whitelisted lightning peer.The architecture utilizes a standard lightning connection as the communication channel and custom lightning messages to send commands. What makes this architecture interesting is the minimal changes required on the lightning node itself. Bastien mentions that he has been exploring the implementation using a custom application running on a Ledger Nano S.Although there is still work to be done on the actual commands and their encoding, Bastien emphasizes that the most significant part is the HSM app. He suggests that implementing this idea would be highly beneficial and volunteers to provide better specifications and review the implementation. Furthermore, he proposes that this work could potentially be undertaken under an open-source grant.In summary, Bastien's email introduces a concept for securely sending administrative commands to a lightning node using an HSM as a whitelisted lightning peer. He highlights the minimal changes required on the lightning node itself and expresses his willingness to contribute to further development and implementation.</p>
