    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Summary:The email exchange between Antoine and John discusses various aspects of scalability and usability in Bitcoin. John emphasizes the importance of catering to casual users who simply want payments to work without the need for extensive time and hardware resources. He suggests providing multiple channels to accommodate these users.In terms of scalability, John praises Lightning for its ability to handle a large number of payments per channel without on-chain transactions. He also proposes the use of hierarchical channels, particularly in conjunction with timeout-trees, for effective off-chain resizing and changing pairings.While acknowledging the theoretical possibility of using signatures to create Lightning channels for a million casual users funded by a single UTXO, John believes it is not feasible in practice due to the challenge of getting all users to sign a transaction specifying the necessary signatories.Regarding active draining by casual users, John suggests that if the drain fails, the user should put their channel in the old timeout-tree on-chain to prevent it from timing out. However, he acknowledges that ideally, casual users would only need to perform actions when sending or receiving a payment, but finding a solution for this remains elusive.John agrees with the concern that users may not obtain bitcoin if they haven't signed and submitted a transaction with sufficient fees. He addresses this issue in the "Limitations" section of his post and plans to propose a timing mechanism based on fee levels as a potential solution.In cases where dedicated users funding a timeout-tree fail to rollover a casual user, the casual user should put their channel in the old timeout-tree on-chain. If this failure applies to all channels in the timeout-tree, the entire timeout-tree will be forced to go on-chain, potentially doubling the number of on-chain transactions.John also mentions the possibility of using zero-valued covenant trees and "short-cut" transactions to handle unresolved HTLCs off-chain and minimize the blow-up in on-chain transactions.Overall, the email exchange highlights John's proposals for improving scalability and usability in Bitcoin, particularly for casual users. He addresses various challenges and limitations while suggesting solutions and exploring different approaches.</p>
