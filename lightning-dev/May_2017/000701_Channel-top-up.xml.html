    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj proposes the addition of a new operation to the Lightning Network protocol called "re-anchoring". This method can be utilized for adding or removing funds from the channel by mutual cooperation. It also allows for forgetting revocation information for any older commitment transactions after deep confirmation. The method was excluded from the 1.0 spec because it already had enough in there. Rusty, however, suggests that the proposed solution seems too complex, and instead, A or B could propose a new funding transaction which spends the current one, exchange all the output signatures for a new commitment transaction using that, then exchange signatures for the new funding transaction, allowing them to continue to use the channel as usual, even if the new funding tx is unconfirmed. Christian Decker commented on how elegant this solution is.</p>
