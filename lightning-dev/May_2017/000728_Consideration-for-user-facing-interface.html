    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposed user interface for a mainstream Lightning-enabled wallet would have three tabs: On-chain, In-transit, and On-Lightning. Coins in the On-chain view would be grouped by PKH that unlocks the UTXO and show an estimate of the fee required to add that UTXO as input to a transaction. The In-transit tab would contain a list of funds that are "in-transit," including funding and commitment transactions. The On-Lightning tab would allow users to send On-Lightning, generate an LN invoice, and transfer funds from on-Lightning to On-Chain. The software would keep track of which LN nodes the user usually pays On-Lightning and prioritize making channels to those nodes when moving funds from On-Chain to On-Lightning. It would also perform random channel opens to reduce LN centralization. If the software cannot find routes below the user-specified maximum percentage of total routing fees, it would offer to increase this temporarily for this payment. Finally, HTLC preimages sent by update_fulfill_htlc can serve as receipts, and the payer can give this preimage to the payee as proof-of-payment. A list of such receipts should also be archived by the software, and the user can selectively burn some receipts.</p>
