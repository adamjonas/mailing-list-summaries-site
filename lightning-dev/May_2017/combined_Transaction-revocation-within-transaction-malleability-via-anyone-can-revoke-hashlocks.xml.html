        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network discussion revolves around the issue of transaction revocation, and ZmnSCPxj proposes an idea to deal with it by using private revocation keys. The proposed method involves creating a revocable output with a revocation key known only to the receiver, which can be spent after a certain period of time by the sender, receiver, or anyone who knows the key. Rusty Russell acknowledges that while the issue has been solved, ZmnSCPxj's idea may have different tradeoffs than what Lightning currently uses.ZmnSCPxj clarifies that they meant A could share the key, which allows A to spend B's old commitment transactions. Rusty suggests that trusted watchers can know the revocation keys, which have a compact form and require minimal storage. The conversation also touches on the possibility of using SegWit instead of relying on these kinds of games, and the need for a "burn window" to prevent attackers from stealing coins. However, this still allows attackers to burn the coins, so a blinded revocation key is used, which only the sender knows, making it malleation-proof.There are concerns about countries with difficulty accessing the internet and censorship, leading to disconnection and possible fraud by the counterparty. There was a suggestion to add a TX_NOINPUT sighash flag to allow watchers to operate even in the case of malleation, but it would require a soft fork, and waiting for SegWit is a better option. In summary, the conversation is about revocation keys and their usage for security purposes in the Lightning Network, and various ideas are discussed, including the use of trusted watchers and SegWit.</p>
