    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion about invoice-based transfers has led some users to suggest other use-cases such as donations without prior contact between the recipient and sender. Recurring requirements for such transfers are that the recipient gets the payment preimage to clear the HTLC and that there is a mechanism signaling the sender's identity without out-of-band communication. Possible solutions include adding new information into the routing info or creating a circular route where the payment is masqueraded as an oversized fee deposited at the recipient. The former option is deemed cleaner, while the latter allows the creation of a gambling service that does not require knowledge of its players' identities. The author suggests documenting these brainstorming ideas on the lightning-rfc wiki on Github for future reference and formulation as BOLTs.</p>
