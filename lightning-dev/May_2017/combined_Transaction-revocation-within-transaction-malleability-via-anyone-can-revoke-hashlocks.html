        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>ZmnSCPxj and Rusty are discussing the issue of transaction revocation in the context of the Lightning Network. Even with transaction malleability, ZmnSCPxj proposes a solution involving generating a random revocation key that is kept private by the receiver. The revocable output can be spent after CSV+2 days by the receiver or if the sender can show the revocation key. After CSV+1 days, anyone who has the revocation key can claim the coins, which incentivizes others to enforce the revocation. Trusted watchers can also know the revocation keys.Rusty confirms that the current draft for Lightning uses a revocation key that is malleation-proof. However, there is still a problem of DoS attacks. Tadge's watchers can prevent such attacks. They also touch on the use of segwit to avoid relying on certain games. In response to ZmnSCPxj's suggestion for a "burn window," Rusty notes that it still allows the attacker to burn coins and steal them. In the original Lightning paper, there was a suggestion to add a TX_NOINPUT sighash flag, which would allow watchers to operate even in the case where malleation occurred. However, they agree that since this would require a soft fork, it is better to wait for segwit.</p>
