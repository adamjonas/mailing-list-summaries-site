    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent conversation, Rusty, who is involved in the development of Lightning Network protocol, discussed with ZmnSCPxj a proposed modification regarding the use of proportional routing fees. Rusty stated that there needs to be more information across networks than just the exchange rate and that knowing block numbers for CLTV timeouts on both sides and the topology of the network on both sides are important. He also mentioned that these problems can be pushed to the edges of the network, and nobody else should notice. ZmnSCPxj asked whether this means that there will be some special Lightning Network variant or service specifically for cross-chain operation. Moreover, Rusty highlighted two general problems with random currencies on Lightning Network. Firstly, it's not clear why anyone would want them once Bitcoin has Lightning. Secondly, the assumption made by the developers is that it is not free to create channels, which punts many DoS problems to the underlying blockchain. If one can create free channels, this protection vanishes. When ZmnSCPxj inquired about the meaning of "free" in this context, Rusty explained that he referred to the fact that most altcoins have low or practically no transaction fees.Lastly, Rusty expressed reluctance to add features to 1.0 if possible as they are trying to close down spec changes. In conclusion, this discussion between Rusty and ZmnSCPxj highlights some challenges that come with implementing proportional routing fees involving cross-chain operations and adding random currencies on Lightning Network.</p>
