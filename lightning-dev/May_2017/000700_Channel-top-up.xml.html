    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network was the focus of a recent discussion, with its onion-routing mechanisms being explained. It was noted that side funds do not impact the settled channel state. The conversation also touched on splice-in and splice-out operations as methods for controlling channel capacity. Synchronous splice-in could reduce on-chain load, and a contingency plan is being formed in case Bitcoin can't deploy a malleability fix in two years.One risk associated with uncooperative nodes was discussed, as well as the interaction between CSV and CLTV in commitment transaction timeouts and HTLCs. The top-up proposal was also discussed as an onion route that allows someone off-LN to pay into an LN node without committing funds to open a channel or throw off trackers. Top-up use cases include reviving exhausted channels and routes.Finally, the conversation ended with a discussion on how Alice can expedite payments by opening channels to well-connected nodes before launching her new business. This provides valuable insights into the various features and use cases of Lightning Network channels.</p>
