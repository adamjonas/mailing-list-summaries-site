        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A developer has made minor editorial patches to the Lightning Network RFC repository through email, which included three patches, two of which were related to routing gossip and one was related to IPv6. Rusty Russell, speaking on behalf of the Lightning Network team, thanked the developer for the patches but suggested submitting them as GitHub pull requests to avoid spamming the mailing list. The list is usually used for discussing larger change proposals that should ideally start with a GitHub patch. All three patches were applied and can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/161.ZmnSCPxj">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/161.ZmnSCPxj</a> acknowledged the contribution made by someone to the Lightning Network RFC repository on GitHub and suggested that it would be better to submit minor fixes as pull requests on GitHub to avoid spamming the mailing list. However, they were willing to accept personal submissions if necessary. Additionally, they noted that the mailing list is generally used for discussing large change proposals, which should ideally start with a GitHub patch. The conversation concluded with ZmnSCPxj expressing understanding and signing off.</p>
