    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, John is responding to Dave's comments on his paper about tunable penalties. Dave had pointed out that the first key benefit John described in his paper on offchain channel resizes could be achieved with existing techniques using channel factories. However, John provides two other definitions of the benefit to demonstrate what is new and how hierarchical channels are necessary for them. The second benefit allows for resizing a channel owned by Alice and Bob while resizing a channel owned by Harriet and Isaac, whereas the third benefit allows for resizing a channel owned only by Alice and Bob. These benefits cannot be achieved with channel factories but can be with hierarchical channels viewed as logical channels. John explains how these benefits are important in practice and provides examples from his paper to illustrate his points.</p>
