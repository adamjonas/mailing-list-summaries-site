    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Dustin Dettmer shared his discovery of a race condition that could occur during the 'splice_locked' workflow, which must be addressed correctly. The issue arises if any channel activity occurs between the sending and receiving of 'splice_locked'. This means that sometimes after sending 'splice_locked', you may receive some 'commit_sig' messages that are for commitments that you no longer care about. However, this is only an edge case that implementations need to handle correctly, not a protocol issue. Dustin provided a solution that requires the temporary storing of two items: the last_short_channel_id (the pre-splice short channel id) and splice_await_commitment_succcess (a boolean flag). After sending and receiving 'splice_locked', the last_short_channel_id should be set to the pre-splice short channel id, and splice_await_commitment_success should be flagged as true. If an 'announcement_signatures' message is received with an scid matching last_short_channel_id, the message should be ignored, and the channel connection should not be aborted. If a 'commitment_signed' message is received with the tlv splice_info->splice_channel_id set to something other than the successfully confirmed splice channel_id, the message should be ignored. Once revoke_and_ack is successfully sent or received, last_short_channel_id and splice_await_commitment_success should be reset, and normal validation of 'announcement_signatures' and 'commitment_signed' should be resumed. Dustin concluded that his solution solves the race condition while preserving as strict a validation of messages as possible and removes the need to add new fields to these messages.</p>
