    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A contributor to Lightning-dev has raised a question about routing to a "channel" rather than a node in the context of a paper. The paper makes two contributions, which may be considered interesting. The contributor notes that routing to "FG" - not "F" or "G" but both of them - raises complications such as linking "FG" back with "F" and "G," setting fees, and communicating fees/max_htlc/etc. This also implies that channel capacity can no longer be sensibly gossiped. Despite this, gossiping the overall factory's capacity can still provide an overall lightning network capacity. However, simplifying it would make rebalancing more difficult. The contributor has tried to put some thoughts together on this matter but has come up with nothing satisfactory, posing the issue as a problem instead.</p>
