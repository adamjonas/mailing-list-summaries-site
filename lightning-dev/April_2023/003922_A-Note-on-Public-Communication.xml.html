    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent message to the lightning community, a member named niftynei expressed the importance of public communication when it comes to technical decisions. Niftynei credited Rusty for impressing upon them the need for conversations to be held as much as possible in public. This includes using IRC, mailing lists, and Github issues/PRs. The reasoning behind this preference is twofold. Firstly, it helps document the range of options considered for technical decisions. Secondly, it provides an interface point for new participants to contribute to the discussion. Niftynei's message comes at a time when some members have been communicating in private. Another member, Vincent, chimed in with agreement and noted that although they were not present during the early days of the community, they found some very good discussions about possible problems and solutions. However, Vincent feels that the communication is more fragmented now.</p>
