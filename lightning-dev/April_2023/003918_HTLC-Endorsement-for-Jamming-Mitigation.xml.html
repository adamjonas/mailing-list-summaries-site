    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email provides updates on channel jamming and includes details for the next call on May 1st. The group is planning to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. The email outlines goals for this data gathering, including observing the effect of endorsement in the steady state, gathering real-world data for future simulation work, and experimenting with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. The minimal changes required to add HTLC endorsement are outlined in [2], and a binary endorsement field is suggested to start with. With this infrastructure in place, the group can start to experiment with various local reputation schemes and data gathering, possibly even externally to LN implementations in projects like circuitbreaker [3]. The email proposes a reputation scheme where each node locally tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocates slots reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. For forwarding of HTLCs, if a HTLC is endorsed by a high reputation peer, it is forwarded as usual with endorsed = 1. Otherwise, it is forwarded with endorsed = 0 if there are slots and liquidity available for unknown HTLCs. Endorsement and reputation are proposed as the first step in a two part scheme for mitigating channel jamming. Reputation would be used for slow jams that are easily detected as misbehavior, while unconditional fees would be used for quick jams that are difficult to detect.</p>
