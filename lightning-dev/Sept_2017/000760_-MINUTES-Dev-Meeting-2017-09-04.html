    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the latest update to Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1, there have been no significant protocol changes. However, Rusty has learned a valuable lesson in bitcoin block endianness that he somehow missed previously. The update includes bug fixes and other improvements, including more efficient processing of transactions related to multiple input scripts. Additionally, the update provides better support for macOS Big Sur and includes an important security fix for a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to steal funds from lightning network channels. The release notes emphasize the importance of upgrading to version 0.21.1 as soon as possible, particularly for users who are running older versions of Bitcoin Core. The update is available for download on the Bitcoin Core website, and users are encouraged to verify the authenticity of the software before installation by checking the cryptographic signatures. The release also includes a list of contributors who helped to develop and test the software, highlighting the collaborative nature of the Bitcoin development community. Overall, the Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1 update represents an important step forward in the ongoing development of the Bitcoin protocol, providing bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhanced security features. With the help of the dedicated community of developers and contributors, Bitcoin continues to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders.</p>
