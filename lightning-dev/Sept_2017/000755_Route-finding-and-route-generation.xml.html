    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal for a near-term approach to route discovery and generation in the Lightning Network has been put forward by Billy Tetrud. The protocol would require each node to know about its own local network topology, with a transaction originator querying a number of its connections for routes to the intended destination. This would mean that nodes would not be receiving or storing the entire network topology, making route discovery less taxing on the network in terms of bandwidth and storage space. When a node joins the network, it broadcasts its information to all its channels and requests local network topology information from all its channels for information about channels one hop beyond its direct connection until it has filled its cache to its satisfaction. When a node wants to construct a route for a transaction, it checks if it has a path to that node in its cache and asks all the channels on the edge of its cached local view for their cheapest path. When a node receives a path request from another node, it checks its cache for its cheapest cache-only path and then asks nodes on the edge of its cached local view for their cheapest path, reporting the results that satisfy the max-cost requirements of the requesting node. All the route information can be encrypted and signed so relaying nodes cannot read the information inside, and so the requesting source node can verify which nodes sent that information.</p>
