    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Upon closer inspection, it appears that the spec already includes a statement advising against counting dust HTLCs. This information was brought to light after Eugene Siegel raised a concern regarding the possibility of lowering the feerate. While this issue does seem to be related to the spec, it is important to note that there is currently no in-protocol method for changing the dust limit, rendering the aforementioned concern irrelevant. It has been acknowledged that the same mistake had been made in the past and will be rectified moving forward.</p>
