    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A group of lightning developers including Andreas, Roasbeef and Ren√© Pickhardt have been working on writing a book called "Mastering the Lightning Network" and have shared their progress with the community. In particular, they have created a diagram of the Lightning Network Protocol Suite and are requesting feedback and criticism on its content. The diagram can be found on Wikimedia commons, where it can easily be updated but the link will stay the same as version control of files is available. They plan to use the diagram as a guide for some of the chapters in the book and may eventually add it to BOLT 0 or the Readme of the lightning-rfc. The lightning network protocol consists of intermixed BOLTs which can sometimes be confusing for new users. To address this, the group created an architecture diagram for the Lightning Network and hope to receive feedback before finalizing it. Some categories on the diagram do not fit neatly within a BOLT, so there are discussions about whether they can be added to a BOLT or if there is a better categorization for the protocol. Additionally, BOLT 03 and BOLT 5, which relate to Bitcoin, are currently not part of the diagram. Elliot provided positive feedback on the project and suggested functional categorizations as an alternative to layer mapping.</p>
