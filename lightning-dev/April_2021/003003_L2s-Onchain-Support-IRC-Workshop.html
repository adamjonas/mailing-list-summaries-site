    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A developer has proposed a series of online meetings to discuss improvements that need to be made to the tx-relay and mempool acceptance rules of the base layer, which have caused security and operational issues for Lightning and other Bitcoin second-layers in recent years. The meetings will cover four topics: package relay design or another generic L2 fee-bumping primitive like sponsorship; deprecation of opt-in RBF toward full-rbf; guidelines about coordinated cross-layers security disclosures; and guidelines about L2 protocols onchain security design. The goal is to reach technical consensus and establish a philosophy design and associated documentations. The timeline includes a two-week consultation period, IRC meetings in late May or June, and publication of an agenda in mid-May. A GitHub collection of documents has been created to assist with the workshop.</p>
