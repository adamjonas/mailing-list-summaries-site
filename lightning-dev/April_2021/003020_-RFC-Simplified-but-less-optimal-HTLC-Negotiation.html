    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email exchange, Rusty Russell and Matt Corallo discussed the issue of bugs in the Lightning Network protocol. Russell expressed a desire to eliminate bugs rather than simply catching them through testing, while Corallo suggested that fuzzing could effectively catch many of these bugs. The conversation then turned to a proposal for a simplified version of the existing state machine, which would allow for splicing updates at any time. Both sides would need to send a splice message to synchronize, and no other channel updates could be sent until after the negotiation was complete. While the protocol was initially flawed and needed revision, the hope is that this simplified process will reduce the number of bugs in the system.</p>
