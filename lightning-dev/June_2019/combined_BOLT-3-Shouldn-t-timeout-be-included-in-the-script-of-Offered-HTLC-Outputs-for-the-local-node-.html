        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In this email thread, Ugam Kamat seeks clarification on the BOLT #3 protocol for Lightning Network. He expresses confusion about whether the timeout should be included in the script of "Offered HTLC Outputs" for the local node. Pierre responds that the HTLC-Timeout transaction is timelocked with locktime=cltv_expiry. Nadav also joins the discussion and shares a pull request he opened to clarify this issue. Ugam, still unsure, explains his thought process involving offering the HTLC output, signing the commitment transactions, broadcasting them to the main chain, and spending the third output using 0 0 in the witness stack. According to Ugam's understanding, this would send the outputs to the P2WSH with to_self_delay. Pierre reiterates that the HTLC-Timeout transaction is indeed timelocked with locktime=cltv_expiry. Ugam realizes his mistake and apologizes for his misunderstanding. He thanks Pierre and Nadav for their help and clarification on the matter.This email exchange highlights the complexity of the Lightning Network protocol and emphasizes the importance of clear communication and collaboration among developers. It also showcases the collaborative nature of the lightning-dev mailing list, where developers can seek and provide assistance to ensure a better understanding of the protocol.</p>
