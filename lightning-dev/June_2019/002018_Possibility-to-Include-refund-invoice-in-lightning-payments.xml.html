    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal has been made to add a key-value map to Lightning payments, which will allow the transmission of extra application-level data on each payment. The idea is to attach a refund invoice to any LN payment which will give the recipient the possibility to refund, fully, partially or eventually tip a higher payment amount back to the sender. This could have various use cases such as promotions, refunds, safety deposits, and spontaneous payouts in games. However, this requires the TLV (Type-Length-Value) specification to be finalized first. Once TLV is in place, it would be possible to propose the addition of such data in a Lightning payment. Currently, there is no easy way to transmit extra application-level data on each payment. The variable-length onion packet should finalize "soon" for some definition of "soon."</p>
