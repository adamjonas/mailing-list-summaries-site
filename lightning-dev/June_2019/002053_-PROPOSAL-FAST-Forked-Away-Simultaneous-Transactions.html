    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christian has proposed a change in the current proposal to allow variable payloads instead of fixed 65 byte frames. This can be implemented by repurposing the onion blob in similar fashion as Spontaneous Payments with slight modification. The proposal works in similar fashion to Spontaneous Payment proposal, by packing in additional data in the unused hops. Commitment transactions between A & B, B & C, and C & D now carry only one HTLC instead of two. This means lower fees in case of on-chain settlement and lower routing fees for Alice as Bob and Charlie would not get to charge for two routings. Not all nodes need to support this feature. For example, B, C, E, F, and G does not even know that the payment arrived through branching.</p>
