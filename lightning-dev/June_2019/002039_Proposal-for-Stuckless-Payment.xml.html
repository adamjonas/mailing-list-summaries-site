    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses a potential solution to the "American Call Option" problem relating to stuckless payments. The proposed solution involves the exchange requiring payment of the premium immediately, with the premium encumbered only by the exchange. A basic sketch is provided, outlining the steps involved in the payment process, including requesting a public key anonymously via Tor, routing a payment via the exchange, providing proof-of-knowledge and using signatures to validate transactions. The exchange can force a timeout on the premium payment or require payment before performing the swap. The payer and payee can still lock the exchange funds by not paying the option premium, but the exchange can permanently delete z if it is not paid. Finally, the payer can send a cancel message instead of key in response to ACK.</p>
