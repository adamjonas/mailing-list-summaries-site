    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, ZmnSCPxj suggests splitting up large data into chunks and applying FEC-encoding to each chunk with a separate MAC. This would allow for the recovery of data in case of errors during transmission without having to re-download the entire dataset. The reason for this approach is that decryption is required before confirming the MAC, so if the MAC fails for a chunk, it's better to recover data from nearby chunks rather than re-downloading and re-decrypting the entire dataset. In another email, Stepan Snigirev and Nadav discuss how to simplify the process of decrypting stream data by having Sally use a scalar to generate a point with a fixed sign. This would eliminate the need for Bob to attempt both positive and negative signs for the y-coordinate. ZmnSCPxj agrees with both ideas presented in the conversation.</p>
