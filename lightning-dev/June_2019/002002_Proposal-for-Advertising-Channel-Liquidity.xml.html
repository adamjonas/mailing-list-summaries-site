    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Cezary Dziemian expresses his frustration with the implementation of a project that he had been working on for over a year. He had initially built a prototype based on c-lightning, but due to many issues with it, he decided to switch to LND. Unfortunately, he faced problems with LND as well, as there were some missing API methods. Cezary is considering whether to continue with the project and suggests building a cross-implementation group to work together. He also mentions that his friend is willing to pay for the development of the project, and he prefers to write it in Java. In another part of the email thread, ZmnSCPxj discusses the idea of charging for liquidity on Lightning channels. He proposes establishing a channel with a fixed rate of payment per hour, which could potentially be gamed by a second, cooperating node. However, other members of the group suggest that such activity does not affect the payments made through the channel as there are no terms in the contract regarding payments made through the channel. They propose an alternative mechanism that may be superior to the CLTV-encumberance proposal.</p>
