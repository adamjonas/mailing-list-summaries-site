    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, a proposal was made to add a fixed sign to a generated point in order to simplify the decryption process. Specifically, it was suggested that Sally use a point with a fixed sign so that Bob would not need to try twice and could immediately start decrypting data from stream. The idea of a fixed sign is not new and has been used in R-encoding in Schnorr signatures. ZmnSCPxj, who was also part of the email exchange, agreed that this addition was a good idea and proposed an alternative solution where Sally always uses a scalar to generate a point with a fixed sign or some other property to derive the sign of the missing coordinate.</p>
