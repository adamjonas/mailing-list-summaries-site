        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Dev mailing list is discussing the possibility of attaching a refund invoice to any LN payment to allow the recipient to refund, fully, partially or eventually tip even a higher payment amount back to the sender. The proposal requires the TLV specification to be finalized first so that extra application-level data can be transmitted on each payment. A variable-length onion packet should finalize "soon" for some definition of "soon." Once implemented, this could have various use cases such as promotions, refunds, safety deposits, and spontaneous payouts in games.To achieve the goal of refund invoice, the sender's wallet must agree on a protocol for embedding the return invoice with the LN payment, which controls everything from a UX perspective. An alternative like Hodl invoice exists but is limited as it only offers an "all or nothing" refund option. Another possible alternative is "spontaneous LN invoice creation" with the server acting as a lookup proxy that handles the lightning creation on request.Requirements for refund invoice include generating an invoice and providing it encoded in the payment request as payload on the payer side, while the receiver must be able to settle the actual payment and optionally support the feature after storing the refund invoice on the receiver's side. Nonetheless, leaking the sender's pubkey in every payment seems a major drawback, but the same info could probably be provided externally or out of band if the sender really does want to be refunded and offer better privacy for non-refunded payments. In conclusion, the proposal aims to attach a refund invoice to any Lightning Network (LN) payment to provide the recipient with the possibility to fully or partially refund the payment or even tip a higher amount back to the sender. The proposal is seeking resources or hints for further development and implementation.</p>
