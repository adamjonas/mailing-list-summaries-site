    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On January 24th, 2022, Rusty Russell, Christian Decker, and William Casarin discussed the potential for a common RPC definition that could have any number of bindings. While they agreed that there may not be a control standard, a common subset would be nice. William Casarin also mentioned that he had used json+commando for his prototype and that he did not want to overengineer anything yet. He expressed interest in writing an iOS app that could control all node implementations and planned to try to get something working across multiple implementations before writing up a spec. The link to his prototype can be found at <a href="http://git.jb55.com/lnsocket/file/rpc.c.html">http://git.jb55.com/lnsocket/file/rpc.c.html</a>.</p>
