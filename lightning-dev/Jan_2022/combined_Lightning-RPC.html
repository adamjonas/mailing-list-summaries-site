        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Christian Decker, an iOS developer, has created a C library called lnsocket that allows him to send messages from iOS to control his lightning node. After reaching a point where he can send TLVs using lnsocket, Christian is now considering the format of RPC commands. While JSON-RPC is commonly used, it can be problematic with binary data and doesn't have any concept of streaming. Therefore, Christian suggests that something more compact and rpc-friendly like grpc would be better. Rusty Russell also believes that either JSON-RPC or grpc can serve as a basis for a common RPC definition that can have any number of bindings. Christian and Rusty believe that having an IDL to describe the interface is nice, as it generates conversion code to/from JSON-RPC and grpc that can transparently map them back and forth. They think exchanging the transport layer underneath grpc doesn't change semantics but unlocks a number of potential use-cases. The end goal of an RPC bolt would be super powerful, so that lnsocket could talk to any lightning node. William Casarin reached out to Christian regarding the use of RPC over lightning. William mentioned that although c-lightning plugin uses JSON-RPC payload, something more compact and rpc-friendly like grpc would be better. He is curious about the cln-grpc PR and thinks an RPC bolt will be super powerful in the long run. William expressed interest in writing an iOS app that could control all node implementations and planned to try to get something working across multiple implementations before writing up a spec. The link to William's prototype can be found at <a href="http://git.jb55.com/lnsocket/file/rpc.c.html.In">http://git.jb55.com/lnsocket/file/rpc.c.html.In</a> conclusion, there is a discussion ongoing about the potential for a common RPC definition that could have any number of bindings. While there may not be a control standard, a common subset would be nice. The link to cln-grpc PR on GitHub is available for review.</p>
