        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>David A. Harding and CJP were discussing a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the Lightning Network, where an attacker could send large transactions to themselves over an extended route and let them time out, locking up a lot of funds. To mitigate this, nodes could require either a fast commit or roll-back within a short amount of time or a proof that another channel was closed. However, this proposal would limit the freedom in channel design for a heterogeneous network, as it interferes with the vision of the network. David argued that this proposal does not necessarily require a homogeneous network since only direct peers need to receive a commit, roll-back, or channel close proof.However, the proposal is still incompatible with crossing networks because the risk is borne by the node doing the crossing and its neighbor. As a result, Alice will always have to close with Bob, and Bob may charge an exchange premium for this risk, increasing the overall risk to the network since the attacker does not have to close their own channels. The Lightning Network is vulnerable to DoS attacks, where attackers can send large transactions to themselves over extended routes and let them time out, causing significant financial loss to innocent nodes. The proposed solution in Milan requires nodes to reveal their channel state in certain situations to remote nodes, limiting the freedom in channel design for a heterogeneous network. An alternative solution suggested is for the payer of the transaction to pay transaction fees at the beginning of the transaction to compensate intermediate nodes for damage caused by a DoS attack. There are two variations of this solution: one with a constant in-advance fee and one depending on the time it takes for the transaction to roll back. However, these fees cannot fully compensate intermediate nodes, and they do not significantly impact attackers. There is no alternative solution to address the DoS mode vulnerability, and peer relationships may need to become somewhat trusted to avoid exposing each other to long-duration transactions. The spreadsheet used to evaluate incentives for the proposed solution may be of interest for future exploration.</p>
