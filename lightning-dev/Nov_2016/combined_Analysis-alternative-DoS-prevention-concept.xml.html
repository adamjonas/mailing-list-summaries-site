        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>David A. Harding and CJP were discussing a solution for the denial-of-service (DoS) mode in the Lightning Network where an attacker sends many large transactions to themselves over a long route and lets them time out, resulting in a lot of funds being locked up. To mitigate this, CJP suggested that nodes require either a fast commit or roll-back within a short amount of time or a proof that another channel was closed. However, this proposal would limit the freedom in channel design to a space that can be understood by all nodes in the network, thus interfering with the vision of a heterogeneous network.David reasoned that this proposal does not necessarily require a homogeneous network since only direct peers need to receive a commit, roll-back, or channel close proof. However, the proposal is still incompatible with crossing networks because the risk is now borne by the node doing the crossing and its neighbor. As a result, Alice will always have to close with Bob, and Bob may charge an exchange premium for this risk, increasing the overall risk to the network since the attacker does not have to close their own channels.The Lightning Network is vulnerable to DoS attacks, and a solution was proposed in Milan, where nodes require either fast commit or roll-back within 30 seconds, or proof that another channel was closed. This solution forces nodes to reveal their channel state in certain situations to remote nodes, limiting the freedom in channel design for a heterogeneous network. An alternative solution was proposed where the payer of the transaction could pay some transaction fees at the beginning of the transaction to compensate intermediate nodes for damage caused by a DoS attack. There are two variations of this solution: one with a constant in-advance fee and one depending on the time it takes for the transaction to roll back. However, these fees cannot fully compensate intermediate nodes, and they do not significantly impact attackers.There is currently no alternative solution to address the DoS mode vulnerability, and peer relationships may need to become somewhat trusted to avoid exposing each other to long-duration transactions. The spreadsheet used to evaluate incentives for the proposed solution may be of interest for future exploration.</p>
