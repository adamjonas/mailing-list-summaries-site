        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list discusses the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining multiple channels in the Lightning network. While having a single channel may be simpler for users, it can also be a possible point of failure. On the other hand, opening multiple channels can provide privacy and fault tolerance. However, there are several questions that need to be addressed, such as how many channels should be opened, what the fee per channel should be, and how much funds can be relayed at max.When it comes to mobile Lightning Network wallets, supporting only a single payment channel could be beneficial due to the majority of LN nodes on mobile devices being offline 99% of the time, making them ineffective in relaying payments. Additionally, having a single channel improves user experience and simplifies the user interface. However, if a portion of funds becomes locked in HTLC, it may not be in the user's best interest, especially if the lock lasts for hours.Having multiple channels on a phone that can relay third-party payments can bring about several issues, including the risk of a channel being unilaterally closed due to HTLC expiration, deciding how many channels to open, and how much funds can be relayed at max without interfering with their payments. One solution to this problem is to make sure users understand that a balance is multidimensional, while another solution is to bilaterally close existing channels before creating new ones and recombine their balances.A special payment request protocol has been proposed that allows for negotiation of multiple routes and details between payer and payee. This would involve the payee's QR code containing a server address and other information necessary for the payer to establish a connection with their device. The use of maintenance servers could facilitate this process. Anton Kumaigorodskiy suggests that a protocol for payment requests could be established so that payer and payee can negotiate a number of routes and other details.In conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages to having multiple channels in the Lightning network, developers can choose whether to use a single or multiple channels based on their preferences and the needs of their users.</p>
