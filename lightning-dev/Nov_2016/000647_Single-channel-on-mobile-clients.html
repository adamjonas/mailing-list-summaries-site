    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anton Kumaigorodskiy suggests that a protocol for payment requests could be established so that payer and payee can negotiate a number of routes and other details. This proposal involves the use of a QR code with a server address and other necessary details, rather than H(R)+routing. The QR code would contain one or more routes from rendezvous points, with the payer using an alternative method to locate them without communicating with the payee. The recipient would signal its acceptance of multipath transfers, allowing the client to decide whether to perform a multipath payment. If there is a payment failure, the client can try again with a different path. However, the retry logic has yet to be fully developed. In the event of two paths to the payee (D->C->B->A and G->F->E->A), the client can attempt to reach the endpoints D or G first and then try C, F, B, E before failing. Despite this, if payment failure is common, this approach may still be insufficient.</p>
