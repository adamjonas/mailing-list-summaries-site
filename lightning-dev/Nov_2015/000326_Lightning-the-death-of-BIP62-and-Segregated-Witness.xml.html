    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On November 19, 2015, Pierre asked if there were any resources available on "segregated witness." A log provided by GNUsha.org was linked in response to his inquiry. Another link was also provided for a transcript of a discussion that took place on the subject of segregated witness. Additionally, a GitHub link for elements project was shared which contained information on segregated witness. Finally, a PDF file containing a presentation given by Greg Maxwell on Blockstream was shared as another source of information. Bryan's contact details were also mentioned at the end of the message.</p>
