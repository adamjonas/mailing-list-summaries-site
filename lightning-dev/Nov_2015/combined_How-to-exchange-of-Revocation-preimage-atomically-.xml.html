        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a review of BIP 112, Nicolas Dorier, a Bitcoin developer, noticed a potential attack on the Lightning Network protocol. The issue arises when both parties want to revoke a commitment but need to exchange the revocation preimage. If not done atomically, Alice can intentionally withhold her revocation, preventing Bob from withdrawing his funds. Rusty, another Bitcoin developer, acknowledged the issue and provided a solution.The concern was addressed by Tadge, who explained that there is no real attack as every update of channel state has an initiator. The user initiating the channel state change goes first, meaning the payer goes first. With revocations, if Alice sends more coin to Bob, Alice signs a new state and sends half signed tx to Bob. Bob signs the new state and sends half signed tx to Alice. Alice revokes the old state by sending preimage to Bob, and Bob revokes the old state by sending preimage to Alice. If Bob fails to perform the last step, the payment can be considered not to have gone through. However, Bob does not have much motivation to fail as leaving the channel in an indeterminate state is worse for him than a fully determined state where he has more money. Therefore, requiring a third party may be a solution, but this defeats the purpose.</p>
