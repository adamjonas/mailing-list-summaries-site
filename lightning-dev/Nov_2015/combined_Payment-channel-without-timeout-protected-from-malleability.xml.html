    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The conversation is about opening a channel without suffering from malleability attack. By adapting an idea from gmaxwell, it is possible to do so. The process for A to open channel with B involves asking B's pubkey, creating the first commitment transaction, extracting the hash that B needs to sign after which A asks B to sign the hash but does not disclose the commitment and finally broadcasting the anchor followed by announcing it to B after confirmation. After passing the unsigned commitment to B and verifying that it's in the right format, B will provide a signature for a tx that has the anchor as input and has a single refund output payable to (A && OP_CSV) | (B && OP_HASH  OP_EQUALVERIFY). However, if A reuses a key, B can guess the redeem hash and would identify the transaction to malleate at broadcast time before A's announcement. Therefore, neither A nor B should reuse pubkeys between different channels using this protocol. Nonetheless, someone other than B could malleate the anchor between broadcast and confirmation just for their own amusement. Using child-pays-for-parent seems plausible, but CPFP doesn't work yet, and segregated witness seems like it'll happen sooner anyway.</p>
