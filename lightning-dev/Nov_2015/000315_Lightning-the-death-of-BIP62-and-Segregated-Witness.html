    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread, someone identified as sickpig at gmail.com shared links related to Segregated Witness with Pierre. The links included the GitHub repository for Elements Project, a presentation by Greg Maxwell about Blockstream, and a specific page on segregated witness. The lack of information on Segregated Witness was noted on Reddit, with speculation that it may be a simple concept and those working on it, such as sipa and gmaxwell, have not felt the need to write it up. The good news is that it can apparently be done with a soft fork similar to P2SH. The email thread also includes a signature from Glenn H. Tarbox, PhD.</p>
