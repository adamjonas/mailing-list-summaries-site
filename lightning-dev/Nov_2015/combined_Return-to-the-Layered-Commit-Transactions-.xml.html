    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns had a conversation about the constraints on timeout based on fees. They suggested batching timeouts to save space in transactions. The maximum number of concurrent committed HTLCs on a channel is 3000 due to the standard limit on transactions. Bob needs to determine the timeout to set on the outgoing HTLC, T_b, in order to keep the channel with Alice open. He must resolve the outgoing HTLC by time T_a-d_a-f_a. At time T-d-f, if the HTLC has not been resolved off-chain, he needs to publish his commitment transaction and it will hit the chain at time T-d. The email thread discusses Bitcoin's constraints on HTLCs and commitment transactions. It explains how Alice can close a channel unilaterally when paying an HTLC and claim a refund while ensuring the counterparty is not cheated. Revocation time and absolute CLTV timeout are also covered, which must increase/decrease with each hop, respectively. The protocol ensures node 19 will demand a response from node 20 at time T-t+k, but worst case is three days unless there are multiple hop failures. If payment fails due to a single hop failure, the nodes' funds will be held up until the node comes back online. Reducing the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY argument would not work usefully because the revocation delay happens simultaneously. Finally, Rusty and Anthony discussed how to close the channel or drop to the blockchain well before T actually comes around.</p>
