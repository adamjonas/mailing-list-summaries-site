        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a proposed implementation of micropayment channels to scale Bitcoin transactions. However, due to the malleability of transaction IDs (txids), there have been concerns about its security. Tadge Dryja proposed a new "sighash_noinput" functionality that would allow for reliable spending from unconfirmed transactions without txid malleability. To test this method's viability, a new "testnet-L" similar to testnet3 will be set up.There are ongoing discussions about the possibility of retracting BIP62, which addresses many vectors for txid malleability. However, BIP62 is not helpful in the context of lightning channel creation because ECDSA sigs are inherently malleable. The author of a lightning variant that used only non-experimental, in-planning BIPs realized that anchor malleability would be an issue and that BIP62, which was assumed to protect against it, would never be deployed. The options were either to ignore it as non-standard, add a timeout to the anchor, propose a reduced BIP62, or assume that Segregated Witness fixes all malleability problems. The author eventually settled on the fourth option, assuming that SW will fix all malleability issues.Segregated Witness is a solution that can allow reliable spends from unconfirmed txs and increase the block size limit without increasing the risk of malleability attacks. In an email thread, someone identified as sickpig at gmail.com shared links related to Segregated Witness with Pierre. The links included the GitHub repository for Elements Project, a presentation by Greg Maxwell about Blockstream, and a specific page on segregated witness. However, there seemed to be a lack of comprehensive information available on segregated witness. Pieter Wuille is working on a prototype of Segregated Witness now, and other parts of the lightning code become significantly simpler if malleability is ignored.The miners can decide which utxo outpoint is consumed assuming there are multiple candidates variant of the idea. The discussion also revolves around various methods to mitigate transaction malleability in Bitcoin, with a focus on the sighash_noinput method, which could allow for innovative constructions but could also be dangerous if public keys are reused, especially in a multisig setting.There is an ongoing debate between a soft-fork and a hard-fork variant in relation to Segregated Witness, a concept that has not been written up much but is being worked on by SIPA and Gmaxwell. The soft-fork plan involves having the scriptPubKey just be the 20-byte hash of the redeem script, while the actual scriptSig is contained in a separate Merkle tree. Meanwhile, the hard-fork variant opts to place the signatures in a parallel Merkle tree.Tadge Dryja discusses the limitations of BIP62 in addressing vectors for txid malleability, especially third-party malleability. He proposes using Segregated witness or sighash_noinput to reliably spend from unconfirmed transactions, with the latter being a non-hard fork change. Tadge aims to start a new "testnet-L" similar to testnet3 with this sighash type to test malleability mitigation out.Scaling Bitcoin HK, an upcoming event, will feature a talk that has generated excitement among attendees. While no specific details about the talk have been provided, it promises to be informative and engaging for all those involved in the cryptocurrency world. A proposed soft-fork plan for Bitcoin will also be discussed at the conference.</p>
