        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a proposed implementation of micropayment channels to scale Bitcoin transactions, but there have been concerns about the security of the network due to the malleability of transaction IDs (txids). To mitigate this issue, sighash_noinput has been proposed as a solution that allows reliable spending from unconfirmed transactions without txid malleability. A new testnet-L has been created to test the malleability mitigation out.Segregated Witness is being considered as an alternative to BIP62 to mitigate malleability, but it is quite a large hard-fork change. There are ongoing discussions about retracting BIP62 as it doesn't address certain types of malleability and every new complex transaction may require new extra rules. It was suggested that the segregated witness part of the plan could be done with a soft fork similar to P2SH.The basic idea of the soft-fork plan is to have the scriptPubKey be just the 20-byte hash of the redeem script. Meanwhile, the actual scriptSig is contained in a separate Merkle tree elsewhere in the block. The lack of information on Segregated Witness was noted on Reddit, with speculation that it may be a simple concept and those working on it have not felt the need to write it up. However, Pieter Wuille is working on a prototype of Segregated Witness now, and other parts of the lightning code become significantly simpler if malleability is ignored.Tadge Dryja has expressed his support for anything that allows reliable spends from unconfirmed txs, and mentions that if Segregated Witness (SW) can get in easier, it sounds good. He also points out the need to be able to reliably spend from unconfirmed transactions and suggests that sighash_noinput can accomplish that. Tadge Dryja hopes to start a new "testnet-L" similar to testnet3 with this sighash type to test malleability mitigation.Different opinions were shared about how to implement segregated witness in an email thread, with some suggesting a soft-fork and others suggesting a hard-fork. Mark Friedenbach came up with a way to do it in a soft-fork, whereas Glenn Tarbox thinks there is very little information available on Segregated Witness. Greg Sanders thinks the hardfork variant is quite simple, as you just stick the signatures in another parallel Merkle tree.In an email thread, someone identified as sickpig at gmail.com shared links related to Segregated Witness with Pierre. The links included the GitHub repository for Elements Project, a presentation by Greg Maxwell about Blockstream, and a specific page on segregated witness. Another person in the conversation, Doug, informed him that Pieter has posted code for a hard fork version of segregated witness on GitHub. The lack of comprehensive information available on segregated witness was also noted.Overall, there are ongoing discussions about the possibility of retracting BIP62 and replacing it with Segregated Witness to mitigate malleability issues. Further testing and discussion is needed before a solid decision can be made.</p>
