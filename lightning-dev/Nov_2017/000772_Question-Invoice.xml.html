    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses various aspects of Lightning Network implementation and usage. The initial email talks about Bitcoin ATMs being built in Poland and the plan to use Lightning Network (LN). The email also mentions a strong pro-LN community in Poland and the availability of a translated version of the LN whitepaper in Polish. The following emails discuss specific scenarios related to LN usage. One scenario involves two hubs belonging to the same person attempting to cheat by not updating HTLC contract to the Merchant, resulting in a "pending" payment. Another scenario discusses the issue of users not knowing whether the other party uses LN or on-chain payment, and the possibility of including both public address and LN invoice in a QR code. The third scenario talks about the decremental time lock and its relation to block confirmation time and the potential solution for unreliable payments.The email thread also includes responses from Rusty Russell and Johan Torås Halseth. Rusty Russell suggests that the transition to LN can be painful, but BOLT 11 QR codes with fallback addresses can be used. He also suggests that if a payment fails, the user can wait or try again with a new invoice. For 1.1, the same invoice can be safely reused as long as the merchant was honest in rejecting the second payment. Johan Torås Halseth suggests adding a lightning parameter to the bitcoin URL to make QR codes backwards compatible. The margin required for turning around payments in LN is also discussed.</p>
