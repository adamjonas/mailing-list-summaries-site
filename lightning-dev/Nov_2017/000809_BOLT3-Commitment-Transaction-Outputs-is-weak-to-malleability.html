    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin developers mailing list, Nicolas Dorier pointed out that the Commitment Transaction Output script is vulnerable to malleability. This means that it can be used to delay the confirmation of the revocation. However, fixing this does not require extensive development work. The penalty transaction for the vulnerability could be delayed by an attacker by malleating it, which could have serious implications as Lightning depends on time locks. Fortunately, a policy rule called SCRIPT_VERIFY_MINIMALIF by jl2012 was merged into v0.15.1, and this issue was fixed by policy rules in 0.14. Even though miners are expected to adopt these changes by the time LN is ready, some people are still concerned about someone manipulating their transactions. Yet, there is another way to fix the situation that would not require the BOLT to change: enabling RBF of the Penalty transaction so Eve's transaction would be replaced by the initial one.</p>
