    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent discussion on the Lightning Network's GitHub page, Olaoluwa Osuntokun confirmed that the mechanisms in place for collaborative routing are indeed the routing hints in BOLT 11 payment requests. Collaborative routing is necessary when parts of the network are not public and helpful in the case of landmark based routing algorithms. The separation of the base layer and onion routing layer would provide end-to-end connectivity between nodes, while the onion layer would choose random nodes in the network. This separation of concerns enables the construction of circuits by randomly selecting nodes in the public network. The current system was chosen to have privacy by default, hence why conflating the base layer and onion routing layer gets us the routing problem in the first place. Olaoluwa also outlined two possible paths for the mechanism at his talk at Scaling Bitcoin. BOLT03 specifies the exact P2WSH committed script, and with a cooperative close all the network will ever see is a 2-of-2 multisig wrapped in a P2WSH being spent.</p>
