    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Commitment Transaction Output script is vulnerable to malleability, which can be exploited to delay the confirmation of the revocation. This can have a negative impact on Lightning as it relies on time locks. The issue is that an attacker can delay the Penalty Transaction by malleating OP_1 into a positive, huge number. This would fill the mempool with the malleated version, resulting in a higher fee rate and further delays in confirmation. However, there is a policy rule called SCRIPT_VERIFY_MINIMALIF, created by jl2012, which was merged into v0.15.1. This fix does not require extensive development and only has a 2-byte overhead. By the time Lightning Network is ready, it is expected that enough miners will have adopted v0.15.1 to prevent this vulnerability.</p>
