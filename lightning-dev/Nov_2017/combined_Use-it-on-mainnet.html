        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Cezary Dziemian, the current state of the Bitcoin payments system is discussed. It is acknowledged that the system is facing challenges due to high fees and unconfirmed transactions. Dziemian believes that the implementation of Lightning Network (LN) is the solution to this problem and urges for its immediate deployment on the mainnet.However, Friedenbach suggests caution and mentions that teams are waiting for cross-implementation compatibility to be demonstrated before announcing any deployment to customers. This indicates that there may be concerns about the readiness of LN implementations for use on the live blockchain network. Dziemian's inquiry seeks to understand if there are any significant issues that need to be resolved or if more tests are required before implementing LN on the mainnet. LN, being a layer-two scaling solution for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, aims to increase transaction speed and reduce fees by creating payment channels between users for instant, off-chain transactions. It is important to note that LN is still in the development and testing stages, with multiple implementations available such as LND, c-lightning, and Eclair. The question raised by Dziemian emphasizes the need to address any technical issues or challenges before deploying LN on the mainnet.Overall, the email exchange highlights the need for further testing and development of LN implementations to ensure their readiness for deployment on the mainnet.</p>
