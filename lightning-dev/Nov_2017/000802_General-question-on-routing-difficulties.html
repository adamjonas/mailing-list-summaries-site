    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, Pedro raises some questions and comments regarding the Lightning Network (LN) implementation, specifically related to routing mechanisms. Christian responds by discussing how the current LN implementation requires nodes to compute the entire route for payments but that there are mechanisms in place for endpoints to collaboratively find a route. He also mentions that they plan to add landmarks for routing in the long-term. Pedro expresses interest in collaborating on landmark-based routing and Christian agrees that he would like to separate the base routing layer from the onion routing layer eventually. They discuss issues with storing complete sets of opened channels locally and potential privacy concerns. Christian explains that the funding transactions are currently indistinguishable from any other P2SH transaction and that the gossip protocol only requires verification of commitment to what is being claimed. Overall, the conversation focuses on various technical aspects of the LN implementation and potential solutions to improve its efficiency and privacy.</p>
