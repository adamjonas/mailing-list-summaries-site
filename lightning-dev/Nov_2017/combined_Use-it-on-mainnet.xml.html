        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Cezary Dziemian is inquiring about the readiness of Lightning Network (LN) implementations for deployment on the live blockchain network, or mainnet, of cryptocurrencies. LN is a layer-two scaling solution that aims to increase transaction speed and reduce fees by creating payment channels between users for instant, off-chain transactions. However, the question raised by Dziemian suggests that there may be technical issues or challenges that need to be addressed before implementing LN on the mainnet.There are multiple implementations of LN such as LND, c-lightning, and Eclair. The message highlights the need for further testing and development of these implementations to ensure readiness for deployment on the mainnet. The email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Cezary Dziemian revolves around the current state of Bitcoin payments system, which is facing high fees and unconfirmed transactions. Dziemian believes that LN is the only solution to this problem and should be implemented as soon as possible. However, Friedenbach mentions that teams are waiting for cross-implementation comparability to be demonstrated before announcing any deployment to customers. This suggests that more tests may be needed before LN can be used in the mainnet.</p>
