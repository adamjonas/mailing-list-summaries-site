        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Cezary Dziemian from Poland raised some queries regarding the Lightning Network. He enquired about the possibility of using both on-chain and LN payments during transactions. In response, Rusty Russell mentioned that though it is possible to use a BOLT 11 QR code containing a fallback address, it requires the user's app to understand the protocol. Additionally, he suggested that the BIP70 payment protocol could include an alternate payment mechanism, but nobody uses it.The writer has some questions about payment options when using LN technology. The first question is whether one needs to ask the buyer what kind of payment they would like to use (LN or on-chain) when someone buys something from them, as not everyone will use LN. It is suggested that a BOLT 11 QR code can contain a fallback address but this requires the buyer's app to understand BOLT11 enough to extract it.The second question involves a scenario where someone sends an invoice, and the writer sends payment, but someone in the middle doesn't cooperate fast. The payment is waiting, and until the time lock period lapses, it is unknown if the payment will be processed or not. The answer is that it's the worst-case scenario, and it is two cases: one where the payment has failed, and one where it has succeeded, and it is unknown yet.Thirdly, it is asked if the decremental time lock is strongly related to block confirmation time, and if there was a currency that had very fast confirmation time, then the time lock period could be short, potentially solving the problem described in paragraph 2. While somewhat related, it still needs a margin to turn around payments.In summary, Rusty Russell provided insightful answers to the questions raised by Cezary Dziemian.</p>
