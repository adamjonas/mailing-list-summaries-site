    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Cezary Dziemian, a Bitcoin ATM builder from Poland, expressed gratitude for the response to his previous inquiry. He mentioned that the Lightning Network (LN) is believed to be the next big thing in Poland with a huge pro-LN community and translated LN whitepaper to Polish. Cezary asked if it would be possible for a payer to make two payments based on the same invoice under a particular scenario.Rusty Russell, a developer of the Lightning Network, responded that this scenario would not be possible because the payer's wallet would refuse to make two payments to the same payment_hash until one has failed. Rusty advised Cezary to ask the merchant for another invoice instead of trying to make another payment using the same invoice.</p>
