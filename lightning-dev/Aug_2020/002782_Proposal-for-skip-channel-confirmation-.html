    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the ability to skip a channel funding transaction confirmation, making the channel operational before its on-chain confirmation, known as a zero-conf channel. Different implementations support zero-conf channels in different ways, and these implementations have defined their own way of agreeing on a short_channel_id (fake one) before the transaction is confirmed. The proposed changes to the funding flow to support this include accepting a channel message in case the fundee wants to skip confirmation, sending funding_locked while the channel_id is derived using a convention agreed upon by both parties. One proposal for such convention is to take it from the temporary_channel_id provided in the previous open_channel message. A higher layer spec could gather specifications on other point-to-point Lightning programmable interfaces. With regards to unidirectional 0-conf, some wallets use a push_msat value payable once but it is a perfectly reasonable trust model.</p>
