        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network's issue of transaction revocation, even with transaction malleability, seems to have been solved through the use of private revocation keys. User ZmnSCPxj proposes an idea that supports selfish untrustworthy watchers and wonders if it is better than what Lightning currently has or if it has different tradeoffs. The proposal involves creating a revocable output with a revocation key that is known only to the receiver, which can be spent after a certain period of time by either the receiver, sender (if they know the key), or anyone who knows the key. Rusty agrees that this is a good idea and mentions that trusted watchers can know the revocation keys, as they have a compact form. However, using SegWit is a better option than relying on these kinds of games. The Lightning Network paper had suggested adding a TX_NOINPUT sighash flag to allow watchers to operate even in the case of malleation, but this would require a soft fork, making it better to wait for SegWit. The discussion also touches on concerns about countries with difficulty accessing the internet and censorship, leading to disconnection and possible fraud by the counterparty. Terminology is clarified throughout the conversation.</p>
