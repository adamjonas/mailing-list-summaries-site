    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The dual-tx approach has been proposed to address the problem of high refund times and low revocation times. The basic schema involves each payment and refund going to an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction instead of directly to their respective owner. To redeem a payment, one must also broadcast Redeem-TX, and for Refund-TX, one must wait for the agreed refund time. This approach enables separate values for revocation delay and payment timeouts. However, there are two downsides: clearing a payment on the blockchain is more expensive, and updating the commitment transaction requires producing and sending a new signature for each currently included payment. Nonetheless, this approach is backward compatible, meaning it is possible to relay payments with the old setup with the cost of using long refund times. It is not possible to relay a payment that is optimized for dual-tx over hops that don't support it. For low-amount payments, the old schema can still be used.</p>
