    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Pierre expresses enthusiasm for a protocol and hopes that it will suit everyone. He mentions that he was able to implement a toy version of the protocol and pass scripted tests, indicating that there were no obvious issues. He suggests that this could be the first step towards a LN nonreg test set. However, Pierre does question why the "nocommitwait" is optional in the test, wondering why sending two successive commits would be forbidden, given that the more permissive approach is well-defined. Finally, Pierre asks what YA means. For those interested, he includes a link to the scripted tests he passed.</p>
