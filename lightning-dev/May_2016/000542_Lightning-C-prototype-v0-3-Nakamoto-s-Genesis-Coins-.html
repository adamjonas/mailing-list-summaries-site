    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The latest release of Lightning network is mainly focused on under-the-covers changes. The protocol is now fully documented and segregated witness is used for transactions which is required. The wire protocol is fully async as per the latest BOLT#2, and all the on-chain cases like stealing, unilateral close, mutual close are handled as per the on-chain draft. The release also includes many internal improvements and cleanups. However, there is still very little testing and many known bugs, with 100 FIXMEs at current count.The plans for the next release include simple routing and announcing, as well as persistent storage. For a guide to the source, you can refer to the link given in the context. Braydon Fuller, a new contributor, got the chance to name this release.</p>
