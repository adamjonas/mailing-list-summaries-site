    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Mats Jerratsch has proposed an idea to solve the coupling problem between revocation delay and payment timeouts using SegWit. The proposed solution includes each payment and refund paying to an intermediate 2-of-2 transaction, which secures the funds under the premise that one has not cheated by using an old commitment transaction. This makes it possible to set revocation delay and payment timeouts to completely separate values. However, there are two downsides to this approach: clearing a payment on the blockchain is more expensive and updating the commitment transaction requires producing and sending a new signature for each currently included payment.The proposed solution can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork/releases">https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork/releases</a> and further information can be found at <a href="https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork">https://github.com/blockchain/thundernetwork</a> and <a href="https://blockchain.com/thunder">https://blockchain.com/thunder</a>. Rusty congratulated Mats and suggested that it deserves a mail of its own.</p>
