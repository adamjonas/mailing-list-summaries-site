    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, Pierre expresses his satisfaction with the newly implemented protocol and hopes that it will suit everyone. He also shares that he was able to independently implement a toy version of the protocol and pass Rusty's scripted tests, indicating that there are no obvious issues. Pierre suggests that this could be the first step towards a Lightning Network non-regression test set. Rusty agrees and mentions that eventually he would like to have some "canned conversations" to go with the BOLTs for testing against. Pierre then asks Rusty about the "nocommitwait" and why he makes it optional in his test. Rusty explains that it is simpler if you don't let yourself do multiple in-flight commits. Furthermore, this code ensures that only one set of outstanding changes is needed. Rusty then defines YA as "Yet Another." He found a good description on Wikipedia which states that among programmers, yet another is an idiomatic qualifier in the name of a computer program, organization, or event that is unoriginal.</p>
