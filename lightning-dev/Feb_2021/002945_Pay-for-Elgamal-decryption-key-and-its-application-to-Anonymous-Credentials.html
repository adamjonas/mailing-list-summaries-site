    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this post presents an application of Discrete-Log selling on PTLC lightning that has not been widely discussed. By using ElGamal encryption, users can sell both a discrete-log and an elliptic curve point that satisfies certain requirements. This includes KVAC, which is used for WabiSabi and Signal app. The author explains two protocols: pay-for ElGamal decryption key and pay for Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC). In the first protocol, the seller sells the decryption key of an elgamal encryption without revealing the discrete log to the buyer. In the second protocol, the issuer sends an elgamal encryption of KVAC to the buyer. The author believes that KVAC has great potential as a building block of anonymous web apps. Its MAC-based construction is more performant and easy to prove security compared to the similar system for the PKI based anonymous credentials. However, there is no way to charge its users anonymously, and Sybil attack is also a concern for anonymous applications. The author suggests that LN-based payment and KVAC-based apps fit very well in solving these problems.</p>
