    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The context discusses a protocol in which Bob can potentially cheat by aborting the protocol with a winning bet before requesting the payout from Carol. One solution to this is to vet Bob's claim by sending relevant information to Carol and verifying if she pays out the PTLC. However, this protocol may not work without better spam defenses in lightning since PTLC payments have to be serialized or there is a risk of multiple payouts being sent to Bob. Additionally, multiple verifiers can delay the process by forcing Carol to wait for the PTLC timeout to be reached. The writer then suggests that stuckless payments could be a possible solution to allow parallelism of validation at least.</p>
