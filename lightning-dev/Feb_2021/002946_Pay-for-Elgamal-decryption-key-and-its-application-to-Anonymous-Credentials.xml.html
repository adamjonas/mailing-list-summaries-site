    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a post to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Miyamoto proposed an idea for anonymous credentials that utilizes ElGamal encryption and discrete-log selling on PTLC. The proposal involves selling not only a discrete-log but also an elliptic curve point that satisfies certain requirements, including KVAC which is used for WabiSabi and Signal app. Miyamoto provided protocols for two scenarios: paying for an ElGamal decryption key and paying for a Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC). In both cases, the buyer can purchase the item anonymously without revealing their identity. Miyamoto believes that KVAC has great potential as a building block for anonymous web apps due to its MAC-based construction, which is more performant and easier to prove security compared to similar systems for PKI-based anonymous credentials. However, the reason it has not been widely used is that there is no way to charge users anonymously. Miyamoto suggests that LN-based payment and KVAC-based apps are a good fit for each other. Miyamoto concludes by stating that exchanging credentials in this way could be beneficial for services that want to grant certain rights to users in an unlinkable fashion. He also acknowledges that there are still challenges to overcome, such as DoS protection and Sybil attacks.</p>
