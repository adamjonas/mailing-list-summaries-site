    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Nadav shared his thoughts on constructing a negation operation which is composable. He noted that the current NOT operation is not composable, meaning that it is impossible to construct (P_1 AND !P_2) with the existing NOT operation. He also looked at ZmnSCPxj's proposal for escrow contracts and believed that it was essentially just a payment to the seller using the point !(Buyer AND Escrow). Nadav expressed his desire for someone to think of a way to construct some kind of negation operation which is composable in the sense that we can do (A AND NOT B) and/or (A OR NOT B) or the like.Christian Decker responded to Nadav's email and spoke about functional completeness. He noted that any Boolean logic can be expressed using a set of payments in various directions and Barrier Escrows. Christian mentioned that the resulting expressions may not be particularly nice and result in a multitude of payments going back and forth between the participants to represent that logic, but it is possible. The problem should now simply be reduced to finding a minimal representation for a given expression, which then minimizes the funds committed to a particular instance of the expression.</p>
