    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The article discusses a potential application of Discrete-Log selling on PTLC lightning, that could impact the way people make anonymity-focused applications with LN. The author explains protocols for pay-for ElGamal decryption key and Pay for Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC). KVAC is seen to have great potential as a building block of anonymous web apps due to its MAC-based construction being more performant and easy to prove security compared to similar systems. However, it has not been used widely in the past due to the absence of a means to charge users anonymously, leading to DoS protection concerns and Sybil attack. These problems can be fixed by LN-based payment and KVAC-based app, making them suitable for granting server resource rights to users in an unlinkable fashion.</p>
