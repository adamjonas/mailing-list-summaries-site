    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this conversation, the participants are discussing the idea of an anonymous credential scheme and its potential vulnerabilities. The scheme allows for anonymity during payment and receipt of credentials, but this anonymity can be exploited by a malicious credential server who can selectively steal money from users without being detected. Even in a trustful exchange with Lightning Network (LN), the server can still choose to be dishonest to a private channel connected to itself, leaving the victim with no way to prove that they did not receive the credential after payment. Furthermore, even if the server acts honestly, the user may falsely claim that they did not receive the credentials after payment, undermining the reputation of the service. The blind-show protocol is suggested as a way to check if the server is acting honestly when presenting credentials. The participants agree that making the exchange atomic is necessary for a commercial application to prevent exploitation of the anonymity feature.</p>
