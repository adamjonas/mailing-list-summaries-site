    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a conversation between Andres and ZmnSCPxj, the topic of dual-hash HTLCs was discussed. ZmnSCPxj stated that it is not supported by the current Lightning Network (LN) specification and PTLCs are better since they are equivalent to having any number of hashes, unlike dual-hash HTLCs which can only do two. He added that if a change in the LN specification is needed anyway, PTLCs would be the better choice as they enable more features. Regarding the need for L2 wallets to be aware of the escrow, Andres raised a question about developing a 2HTLC extension for it to work with the current version of Bitcoin. ZmnSCPxj explained that every forwarding node needs to support either 2HTLC or PTLC, making it a network-wide upgrade. Therefore, they would prefer to upgrade once from HTLCs to PTLCs rather than have multiple network-wide upgrades.Overall, the discussion highlighted the importance of widespread upgrade and the superiority of PTLCs over dual-hash HTLCs.</p>
