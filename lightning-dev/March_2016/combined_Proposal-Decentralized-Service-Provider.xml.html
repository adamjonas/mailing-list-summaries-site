        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Samuel Kremser has proposed a new improvement for the Lightning Network called Decentralized Service Provider (DSP). The idea behind DSP is to allow end-users access to the Lightning Network without worrying about validating the blockchain or closing times of channels. Essentially, users in a DSP would share their channel(s) which would consist of multiple entities managing tasks in a collaborative way. These tasks include managing Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, managing the Lightning Network Channel(s), and managing communication with end-users and the Lightning Network.In order to prevent any malicious acts, DSPs use deposit addresses that are multi-sig addresses. This means that a majority of the entities within the DSP need to sign off on any withdrawals. Due to this multi-sig construction, it would be impossible for a single entity within a DSP to steal the end-user's Bitcoins. Additionally, DSP entities communicate with signed messages with their end-users and with each other, so everything is provable.If an entity within a DSP were to act maliciously, the other entities could decide to exclude them from the DSP by transferring control of the managed Bitcoins and channels to some new multi-sig address(es)/channel(s) that doesn't require the malicious entity's signature. One of the benefits of using DSPs over Lightning alone is that fewer channels are required, saving space on the blockchain. Overall, DSPs would make it easier for end-users to access the Lightning Network and provide additional security measures to protect against malicious actors.</p>
