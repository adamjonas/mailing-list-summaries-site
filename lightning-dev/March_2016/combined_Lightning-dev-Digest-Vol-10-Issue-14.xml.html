        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In the Lightning-dev mailing list, Samuel Kremser proposed a Decentralized Service Provider (DSP) that would grant end users access to the Lightning Network without having to validate the Blockchain or care about closing times of channels. DSPs would be made up of several entities that manage the tasks of managing Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, lightning network channel(s), and communication with end users and the Lightning Network in a collaborative way. The deposit addresses for the DSP are multi-sig addresses which require a majority of the DSP's entities to sign withdrawals. The Lighting Network channels are managed in this multi-sig style as well. This construction prevents a single entity of a DSP from stealing the end user’s Bitcoins. Other entities can exclude maliciously acting entities by transferring control of the managed Bitcoins and channels to some new multi-sig address(es)/channel(s) that do not require the maliciously acting entity's signature. This could also be done if one entity isn't reliably available.Another advantage of DSPs is that fewer channels are required, since not every end user needs their own channel. Thus DSPs could save even more space on the Blockchain than Lightning alone. Jerome Legoupil sees DSP as a higher-level protocol built on top of the Lightning Network that offers legal protection to service providers and customers against legal risks. He feels optimistic about compliance rules that DSPs may have to follow but notes that DSPs would be exposed to DDoS attacks. Jerome believes that DSPs could also help reduce and limit the UTXO set and enable infinite scalability. The discussion then moves on to other aspects of DSP, such as globally distributed DSPs controlled by trusted entities, setting up individual DSPs with friends, and promoting service providers in the open. The proposal sounds similar to the “voting pools” concept described by Justus Ranvier and how Blockstream is securing their Liquid consortium sidechain.</p>
