        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A vulnerability in Bitcoin's Lightning Network has been discovered that allows for a probing attack by setting too short of an absolute CLTV refund timeout. Rusty Russell suggests mitigating this attack by remembering the onion and randomizing the timeout for the next hop. Mats Jerratsch proposes a solution to this issue, including publishing each node's MIN_TIMEOUT and adding complexity to prevent free payments. The proposal involves using timestamps in the onion object to prevent explicit information on the number of previous hops.The context also discusses potential attack vectors related to routing and payment timeouts. Mats Jerratsch proposes a mechanism to randomize the refund time, but acknowledges that patterns could emerge from this scheme that clever individuals could exploit. Participants in a Lightning Network mailing list debate how to prevent a node from knowing if a payment is originating from another source rather than being relayed. One proposed solution is to make sure that payment timeouts differ between each other, while another involves each node publishing their minimum timeout value.</p>
