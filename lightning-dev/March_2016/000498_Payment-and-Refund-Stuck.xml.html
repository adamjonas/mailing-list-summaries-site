    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of a GitHub repository, which aims to bring together all implementations of a certain protocol and agree on a common denominator, has expressed concerns about the layout being too nested. The author believes that it would be good to have a simple way to move ideas into and through the repository without politicizing proposals. The author also noted that even one of their contributors had not been able to get pull requests accepted. However, the author likes the nested package format as it separates different parts of the application and allows for different implementations side-by-side within that package. The author suggests sticking to named proposals instead of plain numbers while still working on the 1.0 specifications.</p>
