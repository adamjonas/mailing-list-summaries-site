        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a 2016 email thread, Rusty Russell and Peter Todd discuss the importance of small miners in providing independent hashing power. Peter Todd argues that small miners are more efficient at ensuring no single entity controls over 50% of the hashing power in the network.A scenario is presented where Alice and Bob have a channel with 50BTC on each side, but it ends up with 100BTC in Bob's favor. Alice then broadcasts an obsolete transaction and her revocable transaction, prompting Bob to breach. However, his breach transaction is not picked up in blocks. To defend against this attack, Bob should not allow his channels to drop below a certain amount and monitor the blockchain for obsolete commitments. He should engage in a scorched earth policy by broadcasting a replace-by-fee CPFP transaction to himself, offering Alice's share to miners.In an email conversation between Jérôme Legoupil and Dave, they discuss how miners are incentivized to wait for Alice's offer instead of including Bob's worthless breach transaction. Dave argues that all miners should consider mining Bob's transaction immediately to claim its modest fee since the sequence lock on the BTC Alice stole prevents her from spending it for possibly hundreds of blocks.To incentivize miners to include her transaction, Alice offers miners a portion of Bob's 50BTC. This offer is dependent on the probability that nobody else mines Bob's transaction and how many small miners are present in the network.</p>
