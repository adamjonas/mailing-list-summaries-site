        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a scenario where Alice has a channel with Bob, and it ends with 100BTC in Bob's favor, Alice broadcasts the obsolete 50/50BTC commitment tx as well as her revocable tx. Bob breaches but his breach tx is not picked up in blocks. Alice follows up by broadcasting (or privately sending to major pools) the tx: Alice 50BTC -> Alice 25BTC, offering miners to share Bob’s 50BTC with her. For miner M, Alice's tx is worth 25BTC * P(M mines block) * P(nobody else mines Bob's tx). To defend against this attack, Bob should not allow any of his channels to drop below a certain amount to keep some guarantee from Alice, so she won’t have an incentive to behave maliciously. Second, Bob should monitor the blockchain permanently and immediately broadcast his breach tx upon detecting an obsolete commitment that is confirmed. He should assume Alice is offering miners to collude with her and engage in a scorched earth policy by broadcasting a replace-by-fee CPFP tx to himself, offering Alice’s share to miners.In an email conversation between Jérôme Legoupil and Dave, it was discussed how miners are incentivized to wait for Alice's 25BTC offer instead of including Bob's worthless breach tx. However, Dave argued that miners should be treated as multiple independent actors competing against each other. Peter Todd believes small miners are more important than big miners as they provide independent hashing power, ensuring no single entity controls over 50% of the hashing power in the network. A Bitcointalk forum discussion from 2012 is also relevant to the topic at hand.</p>
