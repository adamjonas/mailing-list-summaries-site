    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Anthony Towns, a contributor to the Lightning network protocol, has proposed the creation of a repository for documenting the lightning protocol. The repository, which already exists as set up by Matsjj, would be a place to collect all different implementations in one spot. However, Towns believes that the current layout is too nested and wants to create a simple way to move ideas into and through the repo without making it a place where proposals can be politicized. To this end, he has rearranged Rusty's couple of BOLT proposals and the shachain design txt in a way that makes sense to him. Towns plans to add matsjj's pull requests, anonymous "R" via private key reveal stuff, and Joseph's 2-of-3 Instant Escrow as additional "early drafts". He also suggests adding things from Rusty's "Deployable Lightning" paper, such as the HTLC scripts, or the "elkrem" scheme, or Nicholas Dorier's "backward deterministic [revocation] Value" stuff. Rusty, on the other hand, has planned that BOLT #3 will be the transaction formats, and BOLT #4 the onion and failure message formats, as portended in BOLT #2's references. With the possibility of having released code out by northern hemisphere summer, documenting the protocols/standards is only going to get more pressing.</p>
