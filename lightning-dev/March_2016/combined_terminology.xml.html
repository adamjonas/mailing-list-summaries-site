        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>During a discussion on IRC, participants debated over the terminology to be used in documentation for the failure mode where a node uses too tight a timeout, resulting in the loss of money due to one-sided redemption. The proposed term of "one-sided redemption" was found to be inadequate in conveying the severity of the issue. The suggestion to call it "avoiding timeout on incoming HTLC when forwarding" or something similar was also considered.Furthermore, the discussion also touched upon the confusion caused by the term "revocation preimage," which is used to invalidate old transactions between pairs of nodes. It was suggested that the term "void" be used to describe the old commitment, with "V" as the symbol for the hash/signature/whatever. However, it was noted that "R" for the HTLC "receipt" seems to work fine and should be kept.The risks associated with HTLC timeouts were then explained, which tend to be chained across the network. There is a risk of one-sided redemption if the R preimage received from an offered HTLC is too late to be used for an incoming HTLC, leaving the node with unexpected liability. To avoid this, the node must estimate the deadline for successful redemption for each HTLC it offers and must not offer an HTLC after this deadline.It was suggested to use the term "invalidate" instead of void since it is confusing as it's both a verb and noun. Overall, the discussion focused on finding clear and effective terminology to improve the understanding of the issues and reduce confusion among users.</p>
