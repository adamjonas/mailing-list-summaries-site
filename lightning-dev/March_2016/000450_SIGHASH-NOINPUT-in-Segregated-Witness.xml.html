    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell and A. J. Towns, the developers of Bitcoin, discussed the need for timeout and rhash values to build a script to redeem HTLC outputs that are p2sh. They discussed how pre-signed transactions require sending signatures for each HTLC dealt with, which can become burdensome if there are many active channels with long-lived HTLCs. One solution is to put more in the scriptPubKey, either the entire redeemscript or some kind of multiple-choice P2SH. The developers also mentioned last year's discussion on recovering the timeout/R values recoverable and stated that privacy might be affected by sending this information to a third party who is doing transaction reclaiming. With SegWit, having visible scriptPubKey so that R is trivially obvious is not even possible anymore. The discussion ended with ideas on how to improve the process, including merkelized abstract syntax trees or a new double-length script hash type.</p>
