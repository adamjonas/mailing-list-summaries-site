    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Fabrice Drouin and Nicolas Dorier regarding the payment channel script, Dorier mentions that he has managed to adapt the script to use less space. This version saves around 32 bytes in the scriptpubkey for the R value as well as 70 bytes in the signature when Alice closes the channel. The links to check the scripts for Alice closing the channel and Bob using revocation are provided. Overall, this adaptation saves 100 bytes between the anchor transaction and commitment broadcasted. However, Drouin expresses confusion about how nodes would react when old commit transactions are published and whether they would have to store lots of signatures. In response, Dorier explains that if one R value is stored per commitment, then the solution with OP_CODESEPARATOR is better as it saves space on the blockchain. Nonetheless, if old commit transactions are published, the signatures would need to be fetched.</p>
