        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network protocol is currently being implemented by various developers who propose different ideas for the protocol. However, there has been concern over the nested layout of the repository.Joseph Poon suggests a payment invalidation concept to be used in case an attacker stops one payment. Mats Jerratsch explains that the system can self-correct and that the payer and payee can set a timeout. If this happens, the refund will pay to the same secret hash as the initial payment, and it will pay an amount that is sufficient such that the payer will receive his initial payment completely back.In a conversation on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, Mats Jerratsch discusses how an attacker that stops one payment is just a nuisance as the system can self-correct. The payee must not reveal the secret, and even if he does, the funds will just circle back again.Anthony Towns rearranges Rusty Russell's BOLT proposals and shachain design text on Github and adds early drafts of matsjj's pull requests, the anonymous "R," via private key reveal stuff, and Joseph's 2-of-3 Instant Escrow.Pierre-Marie Padiou discusses ways for reducing timeouts and recovering lost payments in case a node in the chain does not relay the payment to the next node. The author suggests sticking to named proposals instead of using numbers. Furthermore, the author raises concerns about how to resolve the complete chain to remove both the refund and the payment completely. They also discuss how to resolve the case where the refund gets stuck as well.The author proposes that the payee can issue a refund back to the payer if the payment has not arrived after the timeout. However, the author raises concerns about how to resolve the complete chain to remove both the refund and the payment completely. They also discuss how to resolve the case where the refund gets stuck as well.Finally, Rusty responds by saying that his rough plan was BOLT #3 would be the transaction formats, and BOLT #4 the onion and failure message formats (as portended in BOLT #2's references).</p>
