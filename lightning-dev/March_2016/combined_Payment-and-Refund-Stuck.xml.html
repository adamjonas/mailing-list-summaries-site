        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a series of contracts between parties that lock funds in a contract, which can either be fulfilled or voided due to timeout. To reduce the timeout, nodes can find shorter paths or use small timeouts between each other. Mats Jerratsch explains that an attacker stopping a payment would not be very damaging as the system can self-correct by setting a timeout and issuing a refund. The payer can be sure that the payment has been invalidated if the refund pays to the same secret hash as the initial payment and is sufficient to completely repay the payer.Anthony Towns proposed the creation of a repository for documenting the Lightning protocol, which aims to collect all different implementations in one spot. However, he believes that the current layout is too nested and needs a simple way to move ideas without politicizing proposals. Rusty's BOLT proposals and other early drafts such as Joseph's 2-of-3 Instant Escrow will be added to the repository.There are unresolved issues related to how to remove both the refund and the payment completely if an attacker stops a single payment. Nodes could resolve it on their own, but this would need cooperation from the node that isn't relaying the payment in the first place. In such cases, E could give out multiple refunds via other routes until one finally arrives at the payer. A GitHub repository has been set up to document the Lightning protocol, which allows developers to collaborate on the implementation of the protocol. Joseph Poon responded positively to a written document by Anthony Towns, acknowledging that aligning the designs would be beneficial going forward.</p>
