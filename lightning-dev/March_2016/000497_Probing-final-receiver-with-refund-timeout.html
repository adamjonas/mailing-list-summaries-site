    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The proposal is about each node publishing its MIN_TIMEOUT along with other information. The payer sums the MIN_TIMEOUT to the payee and adds some random value to give the initial HTLC timeout, keeping it under the max value allowed by protocol. The payer puts the 'expected_timeout' in each layer of the onion, subtracting the last hops' MIN_TIMEOUT from the initial timeout. For instance, if the maximum allowed timeout is 20 * 12 hours and the route is A (12 hours) -> B (6 hours) -> C (6 hours) -> D (4 hours), then the initial timeout has to be at least 12 + 6 + 6 + 4 == 28 hours plus some padding for transmission delays, say 29 hours.A factor around two is taken as a multiply of the MIN_TIMEOUT. A random timeout between 29 and 240 hours is picked, say now+100 hours, and onion looks like [ A: now+100 [ B: now+88 [ C: now+82 [ D: now+76 ] ] ] ]. However, the author suggests not using the MIN_TIMEOUT here but using it as the minimum time deducted each hop and adding some randomness into it. It also means that two values are needed in the onion object: the value expected to receive and the value to use for the next hop (and therefore the value of the next hop).Finally, the onion object can be saved in a less redundant way.</p>
