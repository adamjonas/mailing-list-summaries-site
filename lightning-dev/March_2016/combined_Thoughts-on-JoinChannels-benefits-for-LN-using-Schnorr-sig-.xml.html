        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Jerome has proposed the idea of multi-party payment channels, called JoinChannels, for the Lightning Network. These channels involve more than two participants and are more efficient than 2-2 payment channels as they require less blockchain space and have a faster signature time regardless of the number of participants. JoinChannels also allow for bigger transfers of value due to their higher connectivity, but all participants must be online to participate in an LN transfer.The author suggests a need for a way to do consensus enforced sequence numbers without requiring everyone to be online. The locktime would lock transaction outputs instead of preventing transactions from being included in the blockchain, allowing double spending as long as higher sequence numbers are used. A soft fork could be used with a locked transactions list committed to in the coinbase. There would be fees to pay to get into the pending list, and it doesn't change when the final locktime is reached.The author proposes only those negatively affected should have to sign to change the state and suggests a moderator and normal participants system for signing a state change. The hub would likely act as moderator, and there would be a penalty if the moderator signs the same state number twice. Ideally, users would sign updates periodically to reduce clutter, and if someone signs state 180, they are signing all previous states too.</p>
