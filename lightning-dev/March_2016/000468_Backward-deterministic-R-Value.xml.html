    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Nicolas Dorier on March 8, 2016, they discussed the idea of one way deterministic RValue Generation. Rusty mentioned that shachain is a variant of this idea which avoids generating several million hashes in advance. He also revealed that he suggested using hashing in the Deployable Lightning paper but did not spell out the idea. The origin of this idea was traced back to Adam Back's email on the lightning-dev mailing list in May 2015. In response to Nicolas' suggestion, another person pointed out that if Alice needs the hash to the first commitment, she would have to hash the random secret seed a million times. Another person commented that this is the same problem as the original idea, just expressed differently.</p>
