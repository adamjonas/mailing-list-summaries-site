        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposed improvement for the Lightning Network, called Decentralized Service Provider (DSP), aims to enhance user access and eliminate concerns regarding blockchain validation and channel closing times. Samuel Kremser suggests that DSP would enable users to benefit from larger channels and more Bitcoins by sharing channels among all users of a particular DSP. DSPs would be composed of multiple entities collaborating to manage various tasks, such as Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, Lightning Network channels, and communication with both end-users and the Lightning Network.To ensure the security of end-user funds, deposit addresses for DSPs are created as multi-signature addresses, requiring the signatures of a majority of DSP entities for withdrawals. This construction prevents any single entity within a DSP from stealing the Bitcoins of end-users. Additionally, DSP entities communicate through signed messages, providing proof of their actions. In cases where an entity within a DSP acts maliciously, the other entities can choose to exclude it by transferring control of the managed Bitcoins and channels to new multi-signature addresses or channels that do not require the malicious entity's signature.Furthermore, DSPs offer the advantage of reducing the number of required channels, resulting in additional space-saving on the blockchain. This further enhances the efficiency and scalability of the Lightning Network. Overall, the proposal for DSP presents a promising solution for improving user experience and addressing security concerns within the Lightning Network.</p>
