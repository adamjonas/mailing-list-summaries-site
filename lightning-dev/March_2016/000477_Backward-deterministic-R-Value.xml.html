    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation, Mats Jerratsch and Nicolas Dorier discuss the use of R values in the context of bipayment channels without HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) in Lightning. Mats initially misunderstands Nicolas's reference to "R-Value," instead thinking he was talking about HTLCs. Nicolas clarifies that he was discussing bipayment channels without HTLCs, where all payments are sequential and commitments can't be made before accepting previous ones.Mats then explains how Alice could accept other payments but not a particular one, which would automatically disclose R for any old payment. Nicolas acknowledges that his mental model might be incomplete as he has only followed the improvements of lightning remotely until now. He also mentions that he has not yet thought about how the idea of hash chain can be used for HTLC.</p>
