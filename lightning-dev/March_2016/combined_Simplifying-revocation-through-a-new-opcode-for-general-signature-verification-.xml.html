        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A proposal was made by Martijn Meijering on Mar 8, 2016, to introduce a new opcode for signature verification for arbitrary but appropriately length-restricted messages. This would be instead of maintaining mirror images of txs and going through the dance of revealing hash preimages. The proposal suggests that it would be easier to sign a message that revokes a previous balance with a hash and sequence number. This could substantially simplify the Lightning Network protocol. Meijering also questioned if he was overlooking anything in his proposal. The proposal was made in the context of the upcoming SegWit and its soft fork mechanism for upgrading the scripting system.</p>
