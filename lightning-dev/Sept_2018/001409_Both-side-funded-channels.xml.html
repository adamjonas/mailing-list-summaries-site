    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to implement both-side funding channels in the Lightning Network has been discussed, with the aim of improving the network's growth. The author notes that this proposal would involve nodes negotiating ahead of time and only materialising if they mutually agreed it would be beneficial. However, concerns have been raised over privacy and locked funds, as well as potential attack vectors, such as a node permanently taking other nodes offline. To mitigate these concerns, the author suggests requiring the initiator of a dual-sided channel to pay a fee based on capacity requested from the initiatee. Additionally, the author proposes an alternate solution of using off-to-onchain swaps to move funds on a single channel back onchain to gain incoming capacity. This solution can be repeated with the same funds to acquire more incoming capacity. It is noted that while the implementation of the former proposal will take some time, the latter solution can theoretically be implemented as early as today.</p>
