    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell, a developer of c-lightning, has implemented a change to the program where an 'r' field will be automatically appended for a channel that has sufficient incoming capacity for an amount. This feature would be useful in payment routing and potentially establishing an initial channel. The feature would also be helpful for the Blockstream Store, which is avoiding centralization by not advertising an address. Although the change has been implemented, c-lightning does not yet use the r= information, but implementations should start using it. Testnet and mainnet nodes are available for testing purposes, and the user can autogenerate an invoice for testnet with insufficient incoming capacity, which won't produce an 'r' hint but will issue a warning.</p>
