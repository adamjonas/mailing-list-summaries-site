    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email conversation discusses the process of a merchant starting to use Lightning Network (LN) by receiving funds. The first step is to fund a channel with the desired amount plus dust_limit*2 and wait for confirmation. The merchant can then buy on-chain bitcoins for LN bitcoins, repeating the process until they have fulfilled their total capacity need or run out of on-chain funds. This process requires possession of all funds to be received, takes longer, and requires two on-chain transactions. However, it is suggested that people who keep their node consistently online for a few months generally get incoming capacity anyway. The issue of multiple on-chain transactions could potentially be solved by a transactional cut-through offered by Lightning, which would generalize splicing and dual-funding. Submarine swaps may also provide a solution, but further research is needed.</p>
