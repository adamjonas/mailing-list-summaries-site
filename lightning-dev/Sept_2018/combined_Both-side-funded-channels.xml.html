        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network's potential implementation of dual-funded channels is being discussed, with concerns around privacy and the potential for attacks on funds. The proposed solution requires the initiator to pay fees based on the capacity requested from the initiatee, and the starting state of the channel would put slightly more money into the initiatee side. The November lightning-dev summit will discuss these issues further, with implementation potentially taking over a year. An alternate solution to the issue of incoming capacity is off-to-onchain swaps, which can be used to move funds on a single channel back on-chain in exchange for slightly higher fees. This solution can be implemented now and repeated until enough incoming capacity is obtained. There are weaknesses to using Lightning Network as a means of receiving funds, including the requirement for possession of all funds, longer processing times, and the need for trustless implementation. Additionally, a conversation between users Giovanni and ZmnSCPxj discussed the implementation of both-side funding channels, with concerns over centralization risks and privacy leaks. To improve decentralization and privacy, every node should support incoming dual-funding requests if it has on-chain capacity.</p>
