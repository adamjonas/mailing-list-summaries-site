    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion among developers on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Rusty Russell proposed a change to c-lightning, where the 'invoice' would automatically append an 'r' field for a channel which has sufficient incoming capacity for the amount. The proposal was put forth as a useful hint for payment routing and also potentially for establishing an initial channel. Christian Decker responded to the proposal, warning that it might leak current channel capacity information to the user, depending on how fine-grained the invoice amount is and how much control the user has over it. If a user can do a binary search over capacities and track it over time, he could very reliably tell how much capacity you have. Johan Torås Halseth asked if there was any reason not to include all incoming channels with sufficient capacity, up to a limit. In response, Christian Decker advised against making many requests to get the same information, as it reduces how much information is leaked.</p>
