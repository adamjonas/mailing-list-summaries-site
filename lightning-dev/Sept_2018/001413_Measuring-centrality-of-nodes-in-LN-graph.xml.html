    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Kulpreet Singh, a researcher, wrote to Elias Rohrer, another researcher, praising his idea of using locked flows to enable distributed execution for discovering routes for payments on the Lightning Network (LN). Kulpreet had questions about how the distributed execution would work practically and if periodic route calculation phases could be used. He also asked if there is an implementation of the push-relabel algorithm in Go that could be tried out on LN. Elias responded by thanking Kulpreet for his work and saying that he finds thinking about LN as a flow network interesting. Elias mentioned that they did some work on a multi-path routing algorithm based on the push-relabel algorithm, but believes there is much room for improvement and other flow algorithms could be promising candidates for routing in the LN. Elias also asked if Kulpreet would use flow algorithms for a more in-depth analysis of the networks graph structure.In a separate email, Kulpreet had written to another researcher, Ren√© Pickhardt, about measuring the centrality of various nodes in the LN graph and the dependence on some nodes to route payments and prevent network partitions. He measured the centrality of nodes and the central point dominance as defined in a seminal paper by Freeman, and the number of articulation points in the network. Kulpreet detailed his findings in a Medium post, where he also elaborated on the choice of the two metrics and what they mean for LN.</p>
