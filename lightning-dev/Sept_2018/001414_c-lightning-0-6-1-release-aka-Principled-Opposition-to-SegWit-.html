    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The c-lightning team has released version 0.6.1, featuring a number of improvements for users and the network. Notably, liveness ping tests are now performed before locking up funds to reduce stuck payments, while better routing considers channel size and fewer spurious closes are achieved through fee estimate improvements and a new feerates command. Gossipd is now less spammy with channel_update, payment errors now refer to the correct channel, and option_data_loss_protect protects peers from being out-of-date. Internally, the client flow has been simplified and JSON parameter handling vastly simplified, among other cleanups and clarifications. The Python testing framework has also been updated, and contributions to the project have come from 31 different authors since version 0.6.</p>
