        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developers recently discussed how to protect against probing and leaks of channel capacity information. Christian Decker advised not to make multiple requests for the same information as it reduces the amount of leaked data. The group also talked about the potential leak of available bandwidth information through new routing hints and how nodes can protect their instantaneous channel capacity. It was suggested that dropping packets is the only recourse against an individual attempting to probe the node.The team debated the knowledge of invoicers versus receivers in a payment transaction. The consensus was that receivers have more accurate information compared to payers, who are mostly mobile wallets with less reliable data. However, it's important to consider incentives and the reliability of information when choosing routes for Lightning payments.The developer of c-lightning, Rusty Russell, proposed a change to append an 'r' field for a channel with sufficient incoming capacity for the amount using weighted probability across peers. Johan Tor책s Halseth suggested including all incoming channels with sufficient capacity up to a limit. However, Christian Decker warned that this change could leak current channel capacity to the user, allowing them to track it over time.Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested that randomly rejecting packets is the only way to protect against probing. Nodes must randomly reject packets to protect the instantaneous available bandwidth in their channels. If a "prober" learns that the node has accepted a packet, then they know that the node has at least that amount as available bandwidth. Laolu mentioned that nodes must accept the HTLC before they can cancel it, but this is mitigated by the max_htlc value in the channel update.The discussion about adding an 'r' field to the 'invoice' feature is ongoing, and Rusty welcomes thoughts from the community about the proposal. The Blockstream Store could benefit from this change, as it deliberately doesn't advertise an address anymore to avoid centralization. Overall, the Lightning Network developers are considering various ways to protect against probing and leaks of channel capacity information.</p>
