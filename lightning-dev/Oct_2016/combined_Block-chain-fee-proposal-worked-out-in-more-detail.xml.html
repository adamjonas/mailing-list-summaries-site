        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author discusses their process of working on a fee proposal before shifting the topic to Rusty Russell's proposed algorithm for bitcoin fees in creating a channel for payment between parties A and B. The algorithm involves the channel creator paying the fee initially, while microtransactions are made within the channel without touching the fee itself. However, if adding an HTLC requires extra fees due to larger transaction sizes, the fee is deducted from the HTLC itself. An example involving A and B with an amount to be paid of 1.000 BTC is used, with an extra 1.997 BTC stored in the channel and a required fee of 0.003 BTC for the commit tx. Commit tx outputs are described for when the tx is locked or released to either A or B, as well as if it were returned to A. Changing the fee size based on blockchain market conditions has not yet been covered.The algorithm has been criticized as not being less exploitable than a naive system, but it does increase channel capacity slightly. Further discussion and refinement of the algorithm is required to address issues such as how to change fee size when on-blockchain fee market conditions change.</p>
