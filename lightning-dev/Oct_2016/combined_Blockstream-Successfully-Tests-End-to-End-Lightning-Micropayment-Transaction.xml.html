        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Blockstream has developed a lightning-fast micropayment system, known as the C lightning prototype v0.5, which allows test bitcoin payments to be made over the lightning network. The lightning micropayment network has been tested successfully from end-to-end, including invoicing, multi-hop payment, and item delivery. During the test, Dr. Christian Decker bought an ASCII cat picture using 0.01 test bitcoin to open a lightning channel with the server. The implementation of the system is set to bind to a random port by default, but Rusty fixed the port to 8334 to make the server easier to find. However, development is still ongoing as some rough edges need to be smoothed out, and documentation needs to be written before the release of version 0.5. Once these issues are addressed, libraries will be created for web developers to construct their own cat picture stores. The Lightning Network is a micropayment system that developers at Blockstream are currently working on. While there is low production value, it fits with the ASCII art used in the project.</p>
