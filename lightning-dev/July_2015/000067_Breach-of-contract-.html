    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent email conversation, Christopher Jamthagen raised a concern about the security of Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). He stated that once the CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify) of an HTLC has expired, the receiver should not be able to use the pre-image to spend the output from a commitment transaction that has not been invalidated. This is assumed in a circuit established between Alice, Bob and Dave.Rusty Russell, in response, agreed with this assumption and suggested that the elimination of the HTLC could happen through a commitment transaction update at or before the expiration time. However, he also considered the option of adding an additional delay for this case but deemed it as overengineering.</p>
