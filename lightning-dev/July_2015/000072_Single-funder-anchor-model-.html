    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Lightning Network mailing list, Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon discuss the dual-anchor proposal for the network. Russell notes that asymmetric risk is not necessarily a problem with this proposal, as either party could abort the transaction without penalty. Poon agrees that non-cooperation risks are not a big deal because the channel will be closed out if parties are uncooperative. Russell notes that there are likely some strange economic incentives at play with channel creation, but it should be clean if both channels are established with the same person. They also discuss using OP_CSV or OP_CLTV for time-locked transactions, but note that BIP 62 is required for OP_CSV. Poon suggests that a model can be constructed using OP_CLTV without BIP 62.</p>
