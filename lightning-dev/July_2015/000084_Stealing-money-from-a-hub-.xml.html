    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Christopher Jamthagen is discussing the Lightning Network protocol and its payment route. In the example, Alice wants to pay Carol some amount, and Carol gives Alice H(R), after which Alice updates her commitment tx with Bob including the HTLC output, and Bob does the same with Carol. Carol then withholds R, forcing Bob to broadcast the commitment tx between Bob and Carol. At this point, Carol can spend the HTLC output because she knows R. Alice refuses to update the commitment tx with Bob, forcing him to broadcast it. This commitment tx puts a delay on Bob's ability to spend the HTLC output, but Alice can spend it if the CLTV has expired. In most examples, the CLTV is 2 days between Alice and Bob and 1 day between Bob and Carol, and all CSV delays are 3 days. The discussion establishes that the minimum CSV allowed controls the worst-case HTLC that can be accepted. A CSV of a few hours should suffice if one is online all the time.</p>
