    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent post by Joseph Poon, he notes that it is necessary to store the hash of the R value, which will increase its size to 26-bytes or so. He also mentions that if OP_RETURN is seen as acceptable, then it should be possible to fit three outputs per OP_RETURN metadata output. Beyond three HTLCs, it is important to remember HTLC values forever. According to Poon, this has an effect on how anchor upgrades are done to increase or decrease channel capitalization. Naively, another channel can be opened but alternatively, a new anchor can be created which spends existing anchors. Commitment transactions and HTLCs can be created against both the old and new anchors while waiting for the new one to be buried enough. Once the old anchor is dropped, ancient HTLCs become unspendable, allowing for the forgetting of those old values. Poon acknowledges that issues with avoiding mutation will need to be addressed in another thread.</p>
