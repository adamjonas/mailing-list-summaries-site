    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this context, Mashuri Clark is acknowledging Rusty for running a tight ship and assures him of staying within his parameters. Rusty seems to have set certain guidelines that Mashuri wants to adhere to, and promises to not get too authoritarian while doing so. The reason behind such strictness could be due to the tendency of people to spam mailing lists with their latest altcoin pump.It appears that Rusty wants to maintain the integrity of the mailing list by preventing it from being flooded with unsolicited promotions. Mashuri's mention of fascism may be an indication that Rusty's rules may seem too rigid, but she still intends to follow them. Overall, the context suggests that Rusty is managing a mailing list, which is prone to spamming, and Mashuri acknowledges his efforts in maintaining its quality.</p>
