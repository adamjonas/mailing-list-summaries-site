        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Mats Jerratsch is currently developing a Lightning Implementation Client/Server in Java using bitcoinj as the basic framework. He plans to push it into GitHub soon. However, after reading Rusty's paper, Mats discarded his previous implementation that had trust dependencies and channel transactions were highly asynchronous, making a LN-Network impossible. He wanted to write up his solution for the anchor problem but realized that Rusty's solution makes it possible to have channels open indefinitely, which was not possible with his implementation. Waiting for the anchor tx of the other party is crucial; otherwise, the server has to pay transaction fees for releasing his funds repeatedly. While implementing the new redeemscripts, Mats noticed that there was no delay for the 'HTLC Receiver Redeemscript' when redeeming the contract using R, which could allow the receiver to claim outputs instantly. Rusty suggested mitigating this with OP_CSV after OP_DROP to ensure some delay, especially since clients won't be online all the time, and the delay here determines how often the client has to check back. Rusty also mentioned that he just rewrote his test-cli utils to support dual anchors.In conclusion, Mats praises Rusty's work, even though he had to delete and rewrite a significant portion of his work.</p>
