    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion, Rusty Russell considers the possibilities of each-hop routing and source routing for transactions using intermediaries. He suggests that both methods can be used together, with the former arising as a special case when source routing is specified directly from a hub to the final destination. However, there are cons to each-hop routing, including how to calculate fees and how to route to other hubs without direct channels. Rusty suggests a global routing announcement service to solve these issues. In terms of fees, Rusty questions whether the "fee proportional to satoshi-hours" model is backwards and proposes an alternative structure where the sender pays inversely to how long finalisation takes. He also discusses the problematic case of payment fail after timeout and suggests implementing a fee-enforced TTL. Finally, Rusty considers the use of channels for independent concurrent transactions and explains that they become separate HTLCs.</p>
