    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning network could benefit from the use of a system similar to Tor's nine "directory authorities" that record whether nodes in the network are available, vote among themselves to produce a directory consensus, and sign it. This would enable enforcement of the reputation of lightning nodes without requiring everyone to use the same directory authority. Kevin Greene suggested trusting processors to be highly available and never attempting re-routing, but Rusty Russell pointed out that this would be a poor solution as it would not keep the network honest. Stephen Morse proposed delaying only a portion of the payment while rerouting the rest or redistributing payments allotted for the broken path among other functioning paths. However, dishonest behavior is still incentivized in the current setup, and some form of rating system could be implemented if no cryptographic solution can be found.</p>
