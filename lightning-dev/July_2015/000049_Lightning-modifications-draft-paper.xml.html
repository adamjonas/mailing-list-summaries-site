    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about the development of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and its deployment timeline. The BIP is outdated, and there are no specific timelines for its deployment. There is a debate about the implementation of rules 2-7 in new blocks. Some members believe that these rules are non-standard, while others argue that they are necessary to close vulnerabilities. One member stated that BIP62 is not abandoned but takes time to implement such broad changes and ensure their safety. Another member provided a draft proposal called "ln-deploy-draft-01.pdf" related to Lightning Network development.</p>
