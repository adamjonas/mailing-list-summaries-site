        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell, a contributor to Bitcoin Core, has posted on the Lightning Network mailing list his new design for HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) and establishing an anchor without new sighash modes. According to Rusty, if this can be achieved, the Lightning network would only require OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which are fairly low-albedo soft forks. Previously, the draft paper and current code traded signatures on the first commitment transaction before signing the anchor transaction, but this could not be done in normal Bitcoin as the TXID of the anchor is unknown until after its inputs are signed. Therefore, two anchors instead of one have been introduced, each requiring both parties' signatures to spend. The commitment transaction has two inputs, one for each anchor. In order to solve the problem of getting the funds back in an "abort" case, an intermediary transaction called "Escape" transactions has been added, which spends the 2 of 2 anchor output but can be spent either by 2 of 2 or back to the anchor owner after a delay using OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.</p>
