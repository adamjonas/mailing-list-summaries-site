        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a decentralized network that enables fast and cheap transactions by creating payment channels between participants. However, the routing design of the network has significant implications for privacy and enforcement of regulations. Lightning Network could potentially be split into a regulated and non-regulated part to prevent anyone from interfacing between the two. To address this issue, decoupling the function of "destination address of a route" from the function of "payer endpoint" or "payee endpoint" of a route is suggested.Routing tables are a heuristic that optimizes the probability of payment success when a certain amount of payment is involved in transactions. In order to counter censorship based on destination address, it is suggested that the function of 'destination address of a route' should be separate from the function of 'payer endpoint' or 'payee endpoint' of a route.To avoid gaming and poor privacy models, fees need to be factored in transactions. The proposal for an onion routing system has been made where each node would only see the next hop, the R hash, the amount, the timeout and the fee being offered. Rusty Russell proposed an onion routing system where each node only sees the next hop, the R hash, the amount, the timeout, and the fee being offered, but not the source or final destination. However, this requires source routing, which is a privacy disadvantage as it requires everyone to know the shape of the network.In terms of fees, micro-transaction infrastructure could be used for immediate per-transaction payment of transaction fees, with negative fees incentivizing bringing channels back to equilibrium and creating a market for making money from this. However, this would require stepping away from 'net neutrality' or implementing source routing and setting explicit fees for intermediate nodes. In email conversations, there have been discussions on Bitcoin fees and how they compare to internet access fees. Rusty Russell argued for a fee structure that scales with Satoshi-seconds, meaning the time taken to complete a transaction will determine the fee. Rusty also discusses the idea of extensible source-routing in the Lightning network.Several thousand hubs model does not pose more sensitivity to centralization/censorship than other routing models. Any routing model has routable addresses and risks addresses being censored by a part of the network. In a discussion on how routing will work in LN, Rusty proposed some assumptions to create a strawman for the same. Firstly, it was assumed that each node is known by its pubkey. Secondly, source routing is deemed the easiest route due to its privacy benefits and better tradeoffs between reliability and price. Thirdly, onion routing should be done where each node knows the source and next step. In terms of route broadcast, Rusty's original idea was to have a subset of hubs to which nodes would connect, making full discovery routing easy within that network.Finally, Rusty considers the use of channels for independent concurrent transactions and explains that they become separate HTLCs.</p>
