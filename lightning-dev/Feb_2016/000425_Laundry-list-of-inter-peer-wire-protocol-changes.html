    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Amiko Pay system assigns a number to every message for confirmation purposes. This allows the receiving side to confirm which messages have been received and not-yet-confirmed messages will be retransmitted, ignoring duplicates. The system also allows direct TCP stream communication between payer and payee, which reduces latency and is done on a direct TCP stream between them. This is useful in cases where reduced latency is needed. For v1.0 of the protocol, they will assume that there is a channel for simplicity, and the R hash and route is known by the payer. However, without reserving, a transaction might take three seconds instead of one second, which might be problematic for public transport access gates. Rusty is worried that higher latency is a centralization pressure, and encourages people to sacrifice privacy. He believes that complexity should be avoided, but doesn't know where the threshold is.</p>
