        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network payment channel can be simplified by eliminating acknowledgements, according to Rusty Russell. Each side of the transaction sends updates in the form of ADD, SETTLE, TIMEOUT, FAIL, and UNADD messages, followed by a COMMIT message with a signature. Fee negotiation can be included in the COMMIT message, with a requested fee rate and a range of acceptable values. Eliminating acknowledgements makes for a simpler protocol but it also means that it is uncertain whether the other party has received the message. Removing Hashed Time-Lock Contracts (HTLCs) securely requires removing them, committing, and then the other party revokes the prior commitment. Joseph Poon notes that he is optimizing against payment failure on the ADD side, as failure may require a re-route in the opposite direction to do a full cancel with a non-responsive node in multi-hop payments. However, Russell is not convinced that the re-route scheme will be used in practice. Routing in the opposite direction ties up funds for a long time with no actual likely redemption requiring a large upfront fee. Furthermore, if a node goes down with possibly-live HTLCs, those HTLCs get delayed and the node loses channels which is not free either. Russell believes that if both nodes are well-connected, then eliminating acknowledgements is more optimal if latency is the primary concern. This offers 3x inter-node latency, which is optimal. There was uncertainty on the commitment scheme, so Russell wonders if he's missing a trick.</p>
