    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a bitcoin-dev post, Joseph Poon discusses the need to hand third-parties transactions that can encompass all prior states in a compact way. This is currently not possible with Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions due to the cost of storing previous signatures. However, there are other issues that also need to be addressed for this to work. Specifically, if each output of the Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) is a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), then the timeout and rhash for each one must be included to build the script to redeem it. This means that more information needs to be put in the scriptPubKey for this to work. One possibility is to include the entire redeemscript or use a multiple-choice P2SH where any one of the hashes will redeem the payment.</p>
