    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this message, Martin discusses his interest in the min-cost flow formulation for MPP proposed by Rene and Stefan, which he believes can contribute to reliable payments on the Lightning network. He notes that applying linear approximation to the convex non-linear cost function C(f) can improve runtime but may worsen solution quality. To address this, he considers the approximation quality/error of a piecewise linear approximation for C(f) and how it affects the original success probability of a flow P(f). Martin summarizes his preliminary insights in a document linked in [3], which shows that a piecewise linear approximation of C(f) with given approximation error also provides an approximation of P(f) with lower/upper bound. Additionally, he notes that the approach presented in [1] is a good one, which may address some concerns raised by Carsten in [4]. Martin welcomes any feedback or questions on his work. Links to relevant sources are provided throughout the message.</p>
