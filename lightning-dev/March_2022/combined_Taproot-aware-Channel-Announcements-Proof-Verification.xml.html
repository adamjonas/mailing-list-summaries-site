        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Olaoluwa Osuntokun and David A. Harding discuss the proof and verification process for Taproot integration into the Lightning Network. Currently, nodes use two bitcoin keys to construct a P2WSH multi-sig script and verify that the script matches what has been confirmed on chain. However, with Taproot, the output is just a single key, so there is a concern about maintaining the same level of binding. Laolu Osuntokun suggests that validators verifying the final key derivation can still effectively restrict the type of outputs used to advertise channels.The Lightning Network has integrated Taproot into its codebase, which is scheduled to ship in version 0.15 around April. However, since Taproot means a different on-chain funding output, the existing gossip layer needs modification. Discussions during prior spec meetings have centered on two possible paths: redesigning the channel validation portion of the gossip layer or going with a more minimal mostly the same channel_announcement-like message for Taproot channels. Laolu Osuntokun explores the second option in detail in this email.A new Taproot-aware `channel_announcement2` message could include signature, length information, features, chain hash, short channel ID, node IDs, and Bitcoin keys. To maintain the same level of binding for on-chain output validation, nodes would need to reconstruct the aggregated Bitcoin public key. The `announcement_signatures` message would also need to change. To generate these signatures, both sides would need to exchange their public nonce, which can be piggybacked on top of the existing funding message flow. Overall, Laolu Osuntokun outlines a mostly mechanical mapping of Taproot awareness to the existing gossip message flow that doesn't deviate too much from the current flow, making it easier to deploy.</p>
