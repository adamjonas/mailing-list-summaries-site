    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email is regarding the approximation quality of the minimum convex cost flow formulation for multi-part payments on the lightning network discussed by Carsten and Rene on Twitter and mailing list. The author did some literature research and found an insightful paper by Dorit Hochbaum from 1993 that proves proximity results for integer and continuous optimal solutions of the minimum convex cost flow as well as proximity results of the optimal solutions for a piecewise linear approximation and the original problem. This further underpins that a piecewise linear approximation is a reasonable approach to find optimal flows and even shows that searching for optimal solutions on the continuous domain gives near-optimal solutions on the integer domain. The links to the paper and the lightning network formulation are provided in the email.</p>
