    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A user named Jeremy via bitcoin-dev has suggested removing the dust limit from Bitcoin, citing five reasons. Jeremy argues that it is not their business to determine what outputs people want to create and mentions how dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart contracts. In addition, small HTLCs in lightning force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode, which could have regulatory implications in some jurisdictions. Further, thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as value markers for transactions. Lastly, if confidential transactions were ever implemented, prohibiting dust creation would compromise privacy/allowed transfers. Although some argue that dust is spam and could lead to fingerprinting attacks, Jeremy believes that these concerns are not valid. To remove the dust limit, any node operator can put "dustrelayfee=0.00000000" in their bitcoin.conf file. Moreover, node operators can conditionally allow free transactions by changing specific settings. All these changes can be made without altering the source code. Instead, node operators must be convinced to change their settings.</p>
