        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email conversation, Antoine Riard and Eugene Siegel discuss the implications of offered HTLC outputs in Lightning transactions. Offered HTLCs have three claim paths: revocation case, offerer claiming through the HTLC-timeout transaction, and the receiver claiming via their signature and preimage. The offering party can claim via the HTLC-timeout case on their commitment transaction with their signature and the remote's signature after the cltv_expiry timeout. However, they can only spend with the HTLC-timeout transaction due to SIGHASH_ALL, even if the remote party gives them a signature + preimage. The conversation also touches on the issue of unintended paths in Lightning transactions. They suggest using Miniscript, a subset of script, to prevent surprises and improve security. It is noted that Miniscripts with duplicate keys are considered insane and a policy compiler would never produce such a Miniscript. Additionally, splitting the Script branches into two tapleaves and having bip342 signature digest committing to the tapleaf_hash could solve the problem with offered HTLC outputs. Antoine also mentions from a receiving counterparty safety viewpoint, if you're already suffering a contest, it means your HTLC-claim on your own local commitment transaction inbound HTLC output has been inefficient, and your fee-bumping strategy is to blame. Finally, Eugene believes that there are no cases where the offering party would know the preimage and want to force close, so this is a benign issue.</p>
