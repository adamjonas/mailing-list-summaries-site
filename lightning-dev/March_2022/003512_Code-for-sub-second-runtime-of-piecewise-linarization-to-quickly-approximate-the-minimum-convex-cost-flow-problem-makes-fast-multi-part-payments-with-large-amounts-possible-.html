    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email discusses various questions and considerations related to the development of lnd-manageJ, a tool for managing multi-path payments (MPPs) on the Lightning Network. The author expresses gratitude for a contribution that has allowed them to resume coding and intends to release a usable version soon. However, they note that the code can only be used for real MPPs once a usable MPP gRPC call is made available. The email then outlines various questions and issues related to the implementation, including the reasoning behind combining parallel channels, the use of optimal piecewise linearization, the size of piecewise linearization, leftovers after piecewise linearization, how to integrate fees into the function, non-zero base fees, private channels, and the quality of approximation. Most of these questions relate to technical details of the implementation and suggest potential areas for further research and development.</p>
