    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The lightning-dev mailing list has presented a new protocol for updating commitments on-the-fly that could potentially update all 80k+ segwit v0 channels to the base level of taprooty channels without any on-chain transactions. The concept of dynamic commitments has been revisited in order to upgrade all public channels to taproot without any on-chain transactions. To achieve this, an "adaptor commitment" has been proposed which allows peers to defer the two transactions to close the old segwit v0 funding output and re-open the channel with a new segwit v1 funding output until closing time. For co-op close, one can just spend the v0 output and deliver it to the relevant P2TR outputs. Rusty made a spec PR last year outlining a way to upgrade the commitment type upon channel re-establish. However, a more generalized approach is proposed instead, inspired by the way the Raft consensus protocol handles configuration/member changes.The proposal introduces two new messages, 'commitment_update_propose' and 'commitment_update_apply' with various fields allowing upgrading nearly all channel/commitment related values such as dust limit, max in-flight, etc. The `commitment_update_propose` message includes nested TLV fields and also includes a signature to prevent spoofing and serve as evidence during retransmission phases. The `commitment_update_apply` message can include up to two `commitment_update_propose` messages and can be used to add other commitment updates in the future.This protocol would allow for future-proofing existing anchored multi-sig outputs and removing inflexible parameters in the network such as the 483 HTLC limit, while also providing a way to protect against unforeseen widespread policy changes.</p>
