    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the relationship between channel fees and node reliability, Rusty Russell suggests that those who put effort into their node likely have more reliable nodes, therefore higher fees could be a signal of better routing node operation. However, Olaoluwa Osuntokun argues that raising or lowering fees does not inherently improve node reliability. To test this assumption, Rusty examines data on channel reliability and finds that his assumption is actually incorrect. In fact, there may be a negative correlation between fees and offline channels.</p>
