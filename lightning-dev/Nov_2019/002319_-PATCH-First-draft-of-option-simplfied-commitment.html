    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread between Joost Jager and Rusty Russell discuss the lightning network's proposal to simplify the network by allowing distinct values. Jager asks about the reasons for allowing multiple values, to which Russell responds that the committee added everything to the spec if there was a conceivable reason for it. The two also discuss the possibility of channels getting stuck and the fact that the non-initiator may never pay fees on commitment transactions. They then discuss the issue of adapting to changes in dustRelayFee in the bitcoin network. Russell suggests putting an anchor output limit of 294 satoshis directly into the spec. They also consider making each side pay for their own fundee-anchor and rotating anchors. However, they ultimately decide to stick with funder pays for two as the simplest option. Additionally, Russell mentions David's proposal to reuse funding keys for the anchor output, which would allow anyone to spend after confirmation, even if neither anchor is spent.</p>
