    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between Joost Jager and Lisa Neigut on November 7th, 2019, they discussed the idea of a network of nodes that trust each other. The goal of this proposed network is to remove the need for trusted third parties. However, Jager believes that the term "trust" isn't appropriate in this context. Instead, he suggests that nodes should be aware that their level of service will decrease if they forward spam, thereby encouraging them to be cautious with incoming messages. He proposes that peers should build up a reputation before increasing the inbound limits that apply to channels with them.Jager also notes that we can learn from the current situation with emails, where a system based on reputation tends to concentrate power in the hands of a few big and strong actors, like Gmail. He suggests that if a mechanism to fight against spam by paying to send messages were implemented from the beginning, perhaps a truly distributed system could be created that cannot be censored. Overall, the conversation explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of using a reputation-based system in a network of nodes.</p>
