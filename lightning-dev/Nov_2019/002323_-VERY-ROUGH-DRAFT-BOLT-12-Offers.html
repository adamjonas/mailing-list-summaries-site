    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rusty Russell is discussing the technical aspects of implementing an invoice and payment system for Lightning Network (LN). He notes that there are already UBL libraries in Java and C# but the challenge is to fit the LN order flow into the closest UBL flow which currently seems to be Seller Quotation, Buyer Order, Seller Prepayment Invoice or updated Quotation. Rusty suggests superposing the "strict" LN flow (invoice then payment) onto the business flow and proposes a workflow that can accommodate prepayment invoices without adding new fields to the existing invoice structure. He also points out that none of the UBL examples fit into the 1023 byte limit of the existing invoice format. Rusty agrees that there should not be duplication between UBL and LN structures and proposes using only the UBL structure and adding an opaque field which will be self-contained and only add in the fields specific to LN. However, this requires going through the UBL spec and indicating exactly what fields are permitted and required, as many UBI fields are not amenable to machine interpretation. Rusty suggests forming a sub-group to investigate this further.</p>
