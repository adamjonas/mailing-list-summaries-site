        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning-dev mailing list recently experienced a downtime of approximately 100 to 200 blocks, resulting in undeliverable messages. In an attempt to identify whether the issue still persists, ZmnSCPxj sent a test email to the mailing list. It was discovered that the mailing lists were undergoing a migration process to a new server, which explains the temporary disruption. More details regarding this migration and any potential impact on the mailing list's functionality are expected to be released soon.In the meantime, Bryan, who is presumably a member of the mailing list, provided his contact details at the end of his message. This indicates a willingness to collaborate or provide assistance if needed. However, no further information was given in the context apart from ZmnSCPxj's inquiry about the mailing list's current state.Overall, it seems that the Lightning-dev mailing list encountered a temporary downtime during a migration process to a new server, resulting in undelivered messages. The exact cause and duration of this disruption remain unclear, but updates regarding the situation are anticipated in the near future.</p>
