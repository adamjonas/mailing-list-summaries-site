        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network developer, Rusty Russell, has released a draft version of the "BOLT 12" offer protocol for Lightning payments. The BOLT 12 protocol provides users with an inclusive, QR-code-ready protocol for dealing with invoices over Lightning. Recurring payments are supported, with a range of different options available such as payments due on a specific date, at a specific time, or with a specific number of payments specified.The Lightning Network protocol has a number of requirements for both senders and receivers of payments. There are many requirements that both senders and receivers of payments must follow, including the use of ISO 3166 alpha-2 codes for `delivery_country`, setting the `offer_identifier` to match the offer, and checking the `delivery_` fields, `recurrence`, and `amount`. Address validation poses a significant challenge for network and wallet providers, and either the offer provider or the wallet provider would have to validate inputs.Rusty suggested using Universal Business Language (UBL) to define "business" fields like `address1` and `currency`. However, Yaacov responded that it was not necessary to define these fields as they already exist in software like crm, erp, etc. and are well defined by standard body. The discussion also raises concerns about SLIP-0173 becoming used in practice as IDs since they rely on a centralized manual registry vulnerable to name squatting.The ideal response time for personal communication will largely depend on the context of the conversation and the relationship between the parties involved. With proper communication etiquette and awareness of response time, effective communication can be achieved.Ross expresses concerns about the implementation of delivery address in the LN, as it would be difficult for network or wallet providers due to expected user experience. Yaacov suggests using Universal Business Language (UBL) in the LN specification to create an infrastructure that can be used by businesses when integrating LN into POS systems. Rusty favors simplicity but acknowledges the need for standards for easy integration of POS systems with LN.Rusty also discusses technical aspects of implementing an invoice and payment system for LN, suggesting a workflow accommodating prepayment invoices without adding new fields to the existing invoice structure. The writer suggests defining an explicit mapping between invoices/offers and UBL and indicates the need to go through the UBL spec and indicate exactly what fields are permitted and required. Yaacov proposed integrating UBL into LN, and Rusty responded that UBL could already be used with LN simply by setting the `d` field to "UBL:".The conversation ended with links to two messaging proposals for LN.</p>
