    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is about addressing spam in a network by using rate limits for failures. The proposal is to have a network of nodes that trust each other and apply a 100 htlc/sec rate limit to the channels between themselves, while channels to untrusted nodes get a rate of only 1 htlc/sec. This way, assuming the spammer isn't a trusted node, they can only spam at 1 htlc/s and won't jam up the network. However, someone mentioned that a similar proposal by Conner did not work previously. There was also a request for references to this proposal.</p>
