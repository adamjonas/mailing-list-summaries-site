    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network developers are discussing the implementation of anchor outputs, which will allow for Lightning channels to be opened and closed more efficiently. Anchor outputs allow each party in a channel to have their own anchor output, which is a Bitcoin transaction that locks funds in a multi-sig address. The developers are discussing several key issues related to implementing anchor outputs, including the need for both parties to pay for their own anchors, the dust limit that was negotiated in the open_channel or accept_channel message, and the need for key rotation to prevent watchtowers from brute-forcing hacks. The developers also discussed issues with the to_self_delay value, and how it can lead to gaming situations if the values are not equal.</p>
