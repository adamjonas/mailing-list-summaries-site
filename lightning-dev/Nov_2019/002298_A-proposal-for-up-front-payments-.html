    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal was made on the Lightning-dev mailing list to remove the need for trusted parties in a network of nodes that trust each other. The discussion centered around how to address spam on the network, with one suggestion being to use rate limits for failures. However, it was pointed out that this could still lead to the entire network being jammed up if a spammer manages to get through. The proposed solution was to apply a 100 htlc/sec rate limit to channels between trusted nodes and a rate of only 1 htlc/sec to channels with untrusted nodes. This would limit the impact of a spammer who is not a trusted node. The proposal was made by Joost Jager on November 7, 2019, and discussed on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</p>
