    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In order to prevent spam and ensure a secure network, it has been suggested that senders must solve a small proof-of-work (PoW) puzzle. This proposal is based on the idea that requiring senders to solve a PoW puzzle will reduce the amount of spam on the network by making it more difficult for spammers to send messages.The PoW puzzle would be relatively simple, but still require some computational effort to solve. Once solved, the sender would then be able to send their message to the network. The idea behind this proposal is similar to the concept of mining in blockchain networks, where miners must solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the chain.While this proposal may be effective in reducing spam, there are concerns about its potential impact on the usability of the network. Some users may find it frustrating to have to solve a puzzle every time they want to send a message, while others may be deterred from using the network altogether if the process is too cumbersome.Overall, the implementation of a PoW puzzle for senders is an interesting proposal that could potentially help to address the problem of spam on the network. However, careful consideration must be given to the potential impact on user experience and network usability before implementing such a system.</p>
