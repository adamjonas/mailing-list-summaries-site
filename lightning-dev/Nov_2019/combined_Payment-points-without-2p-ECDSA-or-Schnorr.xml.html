        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network has been exploring the use of "payment points" instead of hashes as the core lock mechanism for lightning. A method using only 2-of-2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG and a single signer ECDSA adaptor signature on one of the keys has been proposed by uSEkaCIO for enabling payment points without needing a proper multisignature scheme. The scheme involves Alice and Bob communicating their public keys, calculating the txid of the fund transaction which spends Alice's inputs to an OP_CHECKMULTISIG 2-of-2 with A B as the keys, and transmitting signatures under B on a refund transaction from Bob to Alice and under A with "auxiliary point" Y on the redeem transaction from Alice to Bob. The single signer ECDSA adaptor signature algorithm presented requires a random k and the DLEQ proof.While there is a security flaw in the scheme, the author believes it is unlikely to affect any proposal in practice. Using this scheme, anything that can be done with 2p-ECSA/Schnorr scriptless scripts is possible except that instead of a normal p2pkh/public key output, there is a 2-of-2 OP_CMS P2WSH output. The core discrete log based lock required to do payment points without a proper multisignature scheme involves Alice giving Bob 1 BTC if he reveals y, the discrete log of Y to her.The proposed scheme is practical but there are still a number of ways it could be executed. Additionally, a proposal has been made for a new key exchange protocol based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. This proposed scheme is simpler than 2pECDSA and even 2pSchnorr, making it a natural step up in complexity from current HTLCs towards Schnorr. The simplicity of the protocol makes it easier to specify and a single BOLT spec could cover the key generation, transaction structure, and signing. The actual transaction structure can be moved towards the ideal Schnorr-based endpoint or the pre-image spending path in script can be replaced with OP_CMS. The author notes that X and Y are usually both transient keys, so learning a DDH key does not help an attacker at all. The proposed method involves applying the 2pECDSA adaptor signature to single signer ECDSA and OP_CHECKMULTISIG to fill the gap. The author invites feedback on their idea.</p>
