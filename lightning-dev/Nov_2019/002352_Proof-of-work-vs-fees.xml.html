    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion is focused on using PoW as an anti-spam measure for the Lightning Network (LN). The conversation revolves around the idea that if PoW were to actively limit spam, then the PoW target must be high enough that burst-spamming would not be possible. However, including the recipient public key in PoW can prevent burst-spamming and also help to ensure that the payer cannot outsource the PoW calculation without risking the loss of fees. There is a disagreement regarding whether or not PoW has a market value and if it can be bought for money. One side argues that PoWs have a market value, while the other suggests that PoW and fees are not interchangeable as an anti-spam measure for LN. Both sides seem to agree that there isn't enough information to determine whether every PoW-based scheme can be transformed into an equivalent fee-based scheme.Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities of using PoW as an anti-spam measure for the LN. It concludes with a reminder that the University of Edinburgh is a charitable body registered in Scotland with registration number SC005336.</p>
