    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns, they discuss the need for an accumulator that has specific properties. Alice provides tokens and a base accumulator, Bob and others can add tokens to the accumulator, but they can also tell if invalid tokens have been added or how many tokens have been added without being able to see what tokens were added. They discuss the potential issue of refund amounts revealing the path and propose a solution where payments are made both ways, so the refund decreases on the way back. They also discuss the idea of making the amount work like the onion, staying constant. They propose a routing failure case and suggest obscuring the path length. Finally, they consider the use of ECC trapdoor and scriptless scripts to prevent uncooperative routing failure cases.</p>
