    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network is exploring the possibility of Trampoline routing, which would improve the efficiency of payments on the network. Trampoline nodes along the route could aggregate incoming multi-part payments and decide how to split outgoing aggregated payments based on their knowledge of local channel balances. This would enable high AMP payments and better rendezvous routing than normal payments.Trampoline routing also allows for pre-encryption on a smaller Trampoline onion, enhancing privacy on the network. However, concerns have been raised about exposing payees without their opt-in. To address these concerns, privacy features are being added incrementally, such as the random_scid work and rendezvous. The design and deployment of these features require careful consideration to avoid false promises of privacy.The Lightning Network team is proposing a new mechanism called rendez-vous routing on top of Sphinx. This would allow nodes to negotiate payment routes with each other before sending payments, reducing the need for trial-and-error route finding. Although there are trade-offs involved in implementing this mechanism, such as potential privacy implications when paying to legacy nodes that don't understand the Trampoline onion, the team is working to identify and minimize these trade-offs.The cryptographic details of the proposal are not provided, but feedback and ideas are welcome.</p>
