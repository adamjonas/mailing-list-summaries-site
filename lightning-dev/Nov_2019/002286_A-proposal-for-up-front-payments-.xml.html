    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this discussion, Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns talk about the Lightning network and its payment system. Rusty sends an HTLC to Dave with a nonce and 25 hashes of it. He also sends ZZZZZ and 25x50 msat to Rusty as the cost for its pre-image leading to this hash. Rusty then decrypts the onion and reads the prepay field which gives him the cost of 14 LLLLL. Rusty checks this cost by hashing LLLLL 14 times and it is indeed ZZZZZ, so he pays Alice. Anthony raises questions about the discount for lucky hashing and how it can result in a discount. Rusty explains that PoW adds noise to the amounts and protects against path length exposure. They mention some other alternative methods but Rusty emphasizes on paying tiny amounts for bandwidth and ensuring honesty. Rusty says that you can still fail to route and still get paid.</p>
