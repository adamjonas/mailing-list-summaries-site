        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell, in a recent email to the Lightning-dev mailing list, has proposed a spec change that would require vendors to be listed on receipts. This proposal aims to improve the user experience in wallets and align with legal requirements. The suggested change involves adding an optional variable named `data_length` to include the vendor's name encoded in UTF-8. Rusty is actively seeking feedback from wallets and vendors on this proposal and has shared a pull request on Github for further engagement.The idea for this proposal was initially brought up at thelightningconference.com, although Rusty admits to being unsure of the originator due to jetlag and enjoying himself too much at the time. It has been pointed out that listing the vendor on a receipt is a legal requirement, and Rusty believes it makes perfect sense to do so. However, the current description field is designed for items only, thus dividing it would enhance the user experience in wallets.The actual implementation of the spec change is relatively straightforward, involving the addition of an optional name of the vendor/supplier (in UTF-8) to the existing `data_length` variable. Rusty welcomes feedback and input from both wallets and vendors to refine the proposal further. For those interested, a pull request can be found at <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/694">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/694</a>. Rusty acknowledges that the pull request may appear intimidating for some, but he encourages active participation and collaboration on this important topic.</p>
