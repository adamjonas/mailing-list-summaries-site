        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Rusty Russell, a prominent figure in the Lightning Network community, has proposed a spec change that would require vendors to be listed on receipts. This proposal was made in response to a legal requirement that has been pointed out at thelightningconference.com. It is suggested that listing the vendor/supplier on a receipt makes perfect sense both legally and practically. However, the description field is intended for items only, therefore dividing it would create a better user experience in wallets. The proposed change involves adding an optional variable named `data_length` with the vendor's name encoded in UTF-8. Rusty has shared a pull request on Github for those who are interested. He welcomes feedback from wallets and vendors regarding this proposal. Although he is currently unsure of who came up with the idea due to being jetlagged and having too much fun at the time, he acknowledges that the idea was suggested to him at thelightningconference.com.Overall, this proposal aims to improve the user experience in wallets while also satisfying a legal requirement. It is easy to implement and has already generated interest among members of the Lightning Network community. Feedback from wallets and vendors will be important in shaping the final version of the proposal.</p>
