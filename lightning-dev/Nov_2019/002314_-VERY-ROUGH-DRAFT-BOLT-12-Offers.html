    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a message to Rusty, Ross Dyson expresses his gratitude for considering implementing something similar to the mainnet protocol. However, he argues that delivery address validation would pose a significant challenge for network and wallet providers. He cites the expected UX of consumer applications in 2019 as an example, where address inputs are validated before accepting payment. In order to handle these expectations, either the offer provider or the wallet provider would have to validate the inputs. If the offer provider handles validation, it could potentially lead to infinite validation attempts, which is not ideal. If the wallet provider were to provide the UX for input validation, they would take on significant workload and responsibility to develop a robust address input UI, and to correctly validate it. This could create a catastrophic user experience if done incorrectly. Addressing this issue would require significant workload and responsibility from wallet providers, which may not be feasible. Rusty acknowledges the challenge but does not seem particularly worried about it, noting that every shopping website in existence has implemented address input (and some form of validation). He suggests that delivery address standardization could be delayed for now, given that most current goods are virtual anyway, but adds that it would greatly improve the UX for such things.</p>
