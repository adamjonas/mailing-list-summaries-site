    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer explains that requiring a fee is similar to requiring proof-of-work incentive-wise, but the two are not equivalent. This is because there is a finite bitcoin supply but an eventually infinite PoW supply, and sats are transferrable whereas PoW isn't. The writer also mentions a paper that claims using PoW for spam prevention in email is ineffective due to the high per-message PoW required to beat spam. The effectiveness of this paper regarding LN needs to be evaluated. Spam prevention is a complex issue as it requires avoiding the Sybil attack, which is one of the most challenging problems in unauthenticated systems. Traditional reputation systems enable authentication, but per-message PoW might be expensive, and per-message fees have incentives issues and may not align with LN's goals. The writer wonders why spam in LN is a more significant concern than in other p2p networks, and suggests that many orthogonal spam prevention measures should be provided with sensible defaults.</p>
