    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network (LN) is not very user-friendly. As a result, Anton Kumaigorodskiy proposed a standard for payer/payee interactions that builds on Lightning invoices and the fact that Bitcoin wallets contain keychains which can be creatively repurposed. His proposal defines four use cases: Incoming payment channel request, Withdrawing funds from a service, Linkable payments, and Log in with Bitcoin Wallet. ZmnSCPxj, a member of the Lightning Network team, responded to the proposal, stating that all of these use cases will soon be implemented within BOLT rather than as a separate HTTP request. However, ZmnSCPxj also addressed the issues that arise when dealing with custodial services and LN fees. He suggests adapting Rendezvous routing to custodial service withdrawals to prevent revealing the public node of the user to the service, which is personally-identifiable information that the service has no right to know. ZmnSCPxj also mentions that payments will have tlv soon, which means type-length-value. This is basically a key-value map added to each payment, sent by the payer and interpreted by the payee. It would be trivial to add a user-linking-key to such a key-value map, although it would have to be defined by the BOLT spec.</p>
