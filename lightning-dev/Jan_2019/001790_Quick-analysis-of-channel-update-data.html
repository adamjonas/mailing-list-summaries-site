    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Fabrice, the topic of set reconciliation schemes was discussed. Specifically, they talked about how to reconcile channel parameters in order to avoid further communication rounds. ZmnSCPxj suggested reconciling [channel id | timestamp | checksum], but Fabrice pointed out that if the timestamp changed while the checksum did not, it would still require further communication to determine that the channel parameters had not actually changed. Instead, Fabrice suggested reconciling [channel_id | checksum] and sharing the set difference if there is a different set of channel parameters, which would allow for sorting out which timestamp is later at that point. They both agreed that the timestamp should not be included in the reconciliation.</p>
