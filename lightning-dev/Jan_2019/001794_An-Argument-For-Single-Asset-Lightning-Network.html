    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Dave on Jan 5, 2019, it was discussed what would happen if an exchange node only sent its preimage to the payer and not to the payee. The concern raised was that without coordination between the payer and payee, the exchange node could potentially take the funds without giving the payee the ability to claim the payment. Upon further reflection, Dave agreed with this assessment and concluded that there is no way to prove receipt of payment without allowing the receiver to block payment by refusing to provide proof. This renders this class of solutions invalid.</p>
