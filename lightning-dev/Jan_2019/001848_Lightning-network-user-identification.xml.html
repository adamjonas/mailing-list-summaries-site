    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>João Joyce has asked if there is a way to identify a user across multiple Lightning Network (LN) requests or authenticate the user in a single step using a LN wallet. In response, ZmnSCPxj explains that LN uses zero-knowledge contingent payments where a secret is released in exchange for money and the service is authorized only when someone presents proof of knowing that secret. Use of payment points and scalars will be deployed to hide the secret paid for from intermediate nodes. Proof of knowledge of a secret is simply a signature algorithm, so a "user" is just someone who knows the secret that was released when they paid for the service. Physical instances of humanity should be allowed to share a single "user", or have multiple "users"; the service provider will still be paid based on their service. João's use cases include buying rights to view an event, getting an album on a music-streaming app, anonymous frequent-user discounts or reward points on vending machines, identifying users across multiple plays and different machines in arcade games, and providing multiplayer gaming with user identity, scores, and in-game items.</p>
