    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between René Pickhardt and Melvin Carvalho, they discussed the vocabulary used in Lightning Network implementations like c-lightning. René recommended using the vocabulary from BOLT 07, which defines gossip messages, as a basis for creating a consistent vocabulary across Lightning Network implementations. He also pointed out differences in naming conventions used by different implementations. For instance, node_id is referred to as pubkey by LND and nodeid by c-lightning. René suggested that the only true identifier for a node is its node_id, which is derived from an HD seed and is bech32 encoded.Melvin asked whether the scheme lightning: should apply to all four types of addresses used in Lightning Network to identify nodes, channels, and payments in the form of bolt11 strings. René clarified that lightning: should only apply to payments in the form of bolt11 strings, while TCP already has a scheme for identifying the other types of addresses. René also mentioned that to identify a base layer transaction, the SHA-256 hash of the genesis block is required in addition to the blockheight, txindex, and output index triple. The two also discussed the possibility of using self-describing data in Lightning Network. Melvin asked if lightning: could be used as the scheme for all four types of addresses. René did not answer this question explicitly but suggested using URIs with a scheme or protocol for self-describing data.Finally, Melvin shared two data structures in LND that describe graph, one for channels and one for nodes. Melvin Carvalho, a developer working on the SOLID project, expressed interest in creating an integration between the Lightning Network and SOLID. In order to do so, he proposed the creation of an ontology, which would port some of the Lightning concepts to the semantic web. The post prompted discussion about the consistency of terms across different implementations, such as c-lightning and Eclair. The thread also included technical details about Lightning nodes, including last_update, pub_key, alias, addresses, and color. Developer Rene Pickhardt offered his contact information at the end of the thread.</p>
