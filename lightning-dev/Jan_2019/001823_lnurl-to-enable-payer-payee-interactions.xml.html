    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Lightning Network (LN) is not user-friendly, and there is a need for a standard in payer/payee interactions that builds on Lightning invoices. To address this issue, an attempt has been made to create a spec that defines four use cases: incoming payment channel request, withdrawing funds from a service, linkable payments, and log in with Bitcoin Wallet. Two of these use cases, linkable payments and log in with Bitcoin Wallet, require a stable user identifier. The proposed solution is to derive a special `LinkingKey` that would be unique for each `(user, service)` pair. This approach would prevent user actions from being linked across different services. The spec defines a cryptographic protocol, and the author requests that someone more skilled than him reviews it for any obvious flaws. The spec can be found at <a href="https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/spec.md">https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/spec.md</a>.</p>
