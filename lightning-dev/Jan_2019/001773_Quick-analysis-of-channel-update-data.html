    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Fabrice, a member of the Lightning Network community, has been investigating why there are frequent channel updates even when fee parameters remain unchanged. To gain insight, Fabrice conducted hourly backups of one of their nodes' routing tables and compared them to see what was being modified. The investigation revealed that there are many updates that do not change anything except for a new timestamp and signatures, occurring up to several times a day for the same channel ID. Additionally, there are many disable/enable/disable updates sent when a channel is disabled then enabled again. As a result, the network ends up syncing information that it already has. Though Fabrice is unsure how best to use this information when syncing routing tables, he suggests a basic checksum that covers only fees and HTLC min/max values could be used to improve routing table sync.</p>
