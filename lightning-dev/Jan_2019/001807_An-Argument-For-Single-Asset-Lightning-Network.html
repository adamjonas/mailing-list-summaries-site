    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a mailing list discussion on the Lightning-dev list, Rusty Russell expressed his belief that multi-asset Lightning Network (LN) will fail to prevent long-lived spam payments which may require proof that something went wrong. This proof won't be valid if it's from a different network and results in the exchange point itself being penalized. Thus, this makes them vulnerable to such a DoS. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests that "cross-asset" need not mean "cross-chain", and cites the RGB project as an example which strives to create assets committed on the Bitcoin blockchain in a way that would be possible to put them into Lightning channels. The victim interfaces between two different Lightning networks, each operating a different asset, possibly on a different block chain or even using a completely different technology. The problem of the victim arises when an exchange transaction arrives from one network, the victim forwards it on the other network, and then the transaction gets stalled. The attacker must be controlling the node on the network that is doing the stalling. The same anti-spam measure that penalizes the victim also penalizes the attacking node.</p>
