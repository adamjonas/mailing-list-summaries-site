        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network community has been engaged in various discussions about the algorithm and fee structure for routing transactions. One suggestion is to modify the algorithm to ignore the fee scheme, while others argue that including fees in the cost function is more systematic and necessary for optimal routing. The idea of a "fee budget" has also been proposed, with research needed on the effect of base fees on computations. There are debates about whether base fees accurately reflect costs and whether ignoring nodes that don't set their fees to a particular structure is a good idea. Another conversation focused on the use of proportional fees and minimum payment values instead of base fees in routing algorithms for Lightning Network transactions. The discussion centered around the cost incurred by nodes for forwarding an HTLC and the opportunity cost of not being able to accept other transactions that would pay higher fees. There was also discussion on how the switch to eltoo would affect the number of HTLC slots and the need for more exploration before making changes to the fee structures.Some members of the community have proposed reducing base fees to allow for migration to experimental algorithms. However, there are concerns about the impact on micropayments, which have a different payment regime than non-micropayments. Pickhardt and Richter propose having a minimum split size for the algorithm, and payments below this size will be sent as single payments using the old algorithm. The minimum possible feerate could be 1 ppm. Developers discussed the problems caused by base fees and the need to match fees to the costs involved. They noted that base+proportional fees paid only on success roughly match the value of forwarding an HTLC, but not the actual costs incurred on failed HTLCs or those that depend on the time a HTLC lasts and vary heavily depending on how many other simultaneous HTLCs there are. Therefore, it is necessary to explore these issues further and conduct more research before making any drastic changes to the system. In conclusion, the Lightning Network community is open to discussing and debating various points about the algorithm and fee structure for routing transactions. While some propose changing the default base fee, others believe it may be premature to reduce base fees. It is important to conduct more research before deploying new algorithms in production and to investigate whether it's possible to emulate the results of current routing algorithms in a faster algorithm without imposing a base fee. The community should also analyze where the proposed algorithm may be most optimal in the HTLC-value channel liquidity ratio ranges. Finally, there were different opinions on whether channels that propose non-zero base fees should continue to be gossiped, with some arguing that base fees are necessary to capture node operators' costs.</p>
