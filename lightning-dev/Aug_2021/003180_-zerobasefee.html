    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion on the Lightning Network's fee structure has resurfaced, with a suggestion to set a network-wide minimum fee at the protocol level of 1msat. However, some have questioned the need for a base fee, as it can have a multiplicative effect when payments are split, and its value changes with bitcoin price fluctuations. Additionally, penalising payment splitting could discourage usage. It is suggested that simple fee structures are necessary and that any changes should be explored thoroughly to avoid issues such as DoS attacks. Some believe that the base fee will eventually become redundant and set to zero by everyone.</p>
