    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Matt Corallo and AJ Towns discussed the use of base fees in Lightning Network. While Matt argued that base fees are useful to capture costs and optimize fee income, AJ disagreed and suggested that node operators should drop their base fee to 0 or a very low amount. AJ also proposed raising the minimum_htlc_amount instead of raising the base fee to avoid wasting resources forwarding small payments. Furthermore, he suggested dynamically increasing the minimum_htlc_amount as a DoS mitigation measure. AJ clarified that he is not suggesting that software should assume only proportional fees in routing algorithms, but rather that research on routing algorithms should continue. He also acknowledged the importance of changing the protocol or deploying new algorithms with care.</p>
