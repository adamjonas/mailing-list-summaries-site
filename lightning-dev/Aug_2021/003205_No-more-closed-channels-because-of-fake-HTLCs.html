    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The author of this post argues that closing channels to redeem trimmed HTLCs is bad for everyone, with no upside. They propose several solutions, including never having stalled HTLCs again (which they acknowledge as unrealistic), not closing the channel and continuing to work through the issue, negotiating between peers to eat the costs of the HTLC, or using an arbiter. The arbiter would act as a proxy for situations where peers can't connect, and would have authority to decide who gets the sats in the HTLC. The author admits that the arbiter idea may sound silly, but believes it's better than the current worst case scenario of closing the channel.</p>
