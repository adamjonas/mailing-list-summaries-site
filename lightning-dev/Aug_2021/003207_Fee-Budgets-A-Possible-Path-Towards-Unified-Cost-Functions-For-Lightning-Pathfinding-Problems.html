    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the conversation, ZmnSCPxj recommends a textbook for better understanding of min-cost flow problem and algorithms. The algorithm that Stefan has found has some shortcomings; it works only for linear min-cost flow problems and is slow. In reality, convex cost functions need to be dealt with, which requires an approach called capacity scaling, making the algorithm much faster. The definition of "separable" is discussed, and it is suggested that Stefan's definition may work by redefining adding up. The concept of "convex" is explained as well, and it is suggested that more involved definitions may be required for complex coordinates. Stefan's concerns about the `#zerobasefee` issue are addressed, and it is realized that it might not actually be a problem for the mincostflow algorithm but rather a problem for the disect algorithm. ZmnSCPxj expresses concern about adding "subtract" and "multiply" operations, as this could greatly increase implementation time and complexity. It is suggested that the effort should focus on the disect algorithm instead.</p>
