    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin advocate Jeremy Rubin has called for the removal of dust limit from Bitcoin, citing five reasons why it should be done. Firstly, he argued that it is not their business to control what outputs people create. Secondly, he suggested that dust outputs could be used in various authentication and delegation smart contracts. Thirdly, he claimed that dust-sized htlcs in lightning force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode which has regulatory implications. Fourthly, thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as value markers for transactions. Finally, he argued that confidential transactions cannot be prevented without compromising privacy and allowed transfers.Rubin acknowledged the main reasons why dust creation is not allowed are that it is spam and can cause fingerprinting attacks. However, he argued that spamming is not valid given the five reasons he provided, and fingerprinting attacks could be prevented by well-behaved wallets not redeeming outputs that cost more in fees than they are worth.</p>
