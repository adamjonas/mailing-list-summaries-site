        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin network. Daki Carnhof proposes an alternative approach to channel fee settings called Zero Fee Lightning Network Routing. This approach aims to encourage individuals to do their own automated fee management, rather than relying on interventions done in fiat and altcoin standards. The author argues that this approach makes sense because computers are already running for Bitcoin nodes and doing simple computations for free.However, ZmnSCPxj explains that there is a difference between running a Bitcoin fullnode and a Lightning forwarding node. The Lightning forwarding node entails the risk of having its funds locked and unavailable during payment forwarding, which means that the owner of the funds cannot use them until the forwarding process is complete. Therefore, most forwarding nodes earn zero or negative net income. Hubs with significant liquidity invested in them may charge some fee based on substantial total amounts and timeframes. Daki Carnhof suggests that the higher interest of the community will just melt into the overall price like Proof-of-Work does if we adopt the Zero Fee Lightning Network Routing approach. He believes that using an algorithm like Hill Climbing would only cause computers to compute more with uncertain results. In conclusion, he thanks ZmnSCPxj for his Algorithm For Channel Fee Settings and offers his 5msat. Daki provides a link to a YouTube video discussing this topic with Jordan P. Peterson and guests, but it is unclear at what specific time in the video the topic is discussed.</p>
