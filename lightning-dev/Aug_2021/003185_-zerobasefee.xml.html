    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj proposed modifying the algorithm used in the Lightning Network to ignore fee schemes and only use negative-log probability as the cost function. However, concerns were raised about how to handle cases of high fees and it was ultimately decided that including fees in the cost function was the most systematic approach. More research is needed on the effect of base fees on these computations, although it was generally agreed that the market should decide whether or not they are economically helpful. ZmnSCPxj suggested that their approach could lead to liquidity being priced correctly and make running a well-stocked LN router more profitable. They also proposed a modification to the algorithm that would allow for disallowing high-fee channels while still achieving optimality in the sense of the paper. Overall, the discussion focused on how to handle fees within the Lightning Network algorithm.</p>
