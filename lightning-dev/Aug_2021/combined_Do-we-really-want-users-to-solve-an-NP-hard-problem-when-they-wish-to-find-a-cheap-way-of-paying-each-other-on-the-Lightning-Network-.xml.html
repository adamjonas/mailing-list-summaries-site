        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A recent Lightning-dev email thread discussed whether users should solve an NP-hard problem to find cheaper ways to pay on the Lightning Network. Andrew Poelstra suggested that it could work, citing Debian's "apt-get install" program that solves an NP-hard problem every time it runs by simulating 3SAT using Depends and Conflicts relationships between packages. He said a similar approach could work for Lightning, with routing on log(N) different networks. One could try to choose a route for all the funds; if that fails, split it; repeat. In some cases, this would fail despite there being a possible successful multipath route, and in other cases, it would choose a moderately higher fee path than necessary. Still, paying a 0.2% fee vs a 0.1% fee when the current state of the art is a 1% fee would be acceptable. Poelstra worked on a related project in Debian that involved working out whether updating a package would render other packages uninstallable, which occasionally hit some of the hard NP cases. However, this was never really a big deal in practice; you just set an iteration limit and consider it to "fail" if things get too complicated, and if it fails too often, you re-analyse what's going on manually and add a new heuristic to cope with it.</p>
