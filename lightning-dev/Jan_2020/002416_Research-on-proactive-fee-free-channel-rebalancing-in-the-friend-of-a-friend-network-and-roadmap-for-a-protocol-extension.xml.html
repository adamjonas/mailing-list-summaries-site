    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>ZmnSCPxj has suggested that the rule used to guide the splitting of payments for multipath could be useful. He highlighted the case where a payer, Alice, has channels to Bob and Charlie, with each channel having its own balance. In order to retain balance, if Alice had to pay 0.1, it should be split into 0.05 via Alice-Bob and 0.05 via Alice-Charlie. ZmnSCPxj asked whether such a calculation could be derived from the published rule. He also mentioned that if the payment is big enough to become imbalanced against the payer, some small amount must be split out to another channel.</p>
