    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The writer observes that the model assumes all nodes are equally likely to be payer and payee, which is expected in a complete economy. However, in transient states, some nodes may demand more incoming funds. The example given is of a manufacturer that has just released a new model of their product and will need more incoming liquidity than in equilibrium. Therefore, JIT Routing is more useful than proactive rebalancing as it is more resilient to such transient shocks to the system. Every rebalance is effectively a speculation that capacity in one set of channel(s) is less useful than capacity in another set of channel(s). Targeting some kind of "perfect balance" assumes that the equilibrium state will generally be true for payments in all directions, but the author thinks that nodes should also be resilient against transient shocks.</p>
