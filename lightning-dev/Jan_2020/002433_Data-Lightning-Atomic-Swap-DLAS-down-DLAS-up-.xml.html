    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Data Lightning Atomic Swap (DLAS) is a mechanism for swapping data and lightning payments atomically. DLAS allows for atomic data transfer between the payer and payee with lightning payment, either for data download or data upload. The protocol uses preimage embedment to ensure that sending and receiving data requires lightning payment at the same time. The size of data is restricted to 256 bits, but it can be extended to larger data and transferred in several payment paths like DLAS-up, which operates using OG AMP. It is important to note that OG AMP guarantees atomic delivery per iteration only, not for all iterations taken together. For large files, it is necessary to split the file into blocks, and the same path may need to be used several times. The correctness of the shared file is ensured by using a Zero Knowledge proof process such as probabilistic checkable proof like TumbleBit. However, the DLAS proposal does not describe a way to detect if data is correct or not, just message as data is no problem because there is no need to check if the message is correct or not. Additionally, DLAS-down has no issues, but it needs a better mechanism to expand data size. On the other hand, DLAS-up requires OG AMP implementation. Finally, channel pubkey should be generated newly every time by a way like hash chain to avoid decryption risks.The article discusses a protocol example for transferring 512 bits of data in two paths. The XOR function is used to calculate the share of data, and then it is concatenated using the || operator. Two pre-images are created using sha256, which can be used to verify the transfer of data. The article also suggests various use cases for this protocol, including hosting incentives, distributed secret key sharing, prevention of email spam and DDoS attacks, incentive for receiving advertisements, and bounty for code bug fixes based on cryptographic proofs or secret computations. The Lightning Network ecosystem is one such use case. The article provides several references to learn more about this protocol.</p>
