        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer network that operates on top of Bitcoin's blockchain. Its purpose is to enable faster and cheaper transactions. However, the Lightning Network faces challenges such as route-hijacking. To prevent route-hijacking, a fixed and proportional max fee could be defined, and a random route chosen that pays no more than those fees unless there are no other routes available. Simple equivalent proofs could also be used to prevent anti-DoS attacks. Although proving 2-of-2 multisig UTXO ownership does not prevent route hijacking, pathfinding algorithms can filter out channels too small to pass a particular payment through using the lower limit of the rangeproof. In addition, non-lightning channels, such as contractual agreements between mutually-trusting parties, could be allowed. Nodes must announce information, including public keys and signatures of the public keys used to lock the funding transaction, in the channel_announcement message in the short_channel_id field. Since Bitcoin does not allow confidential transactions, the channel capacity can be queried from the blockchain even when the amounts are never explicitly mentioned. Funds locking is currently required for DoS resistance, which effectively rate-limits flooding the global routing table with garbage. Other means of rate-limiting could be accomplished with more complexity. However, revealing channel capacity makes the channels susceptible to exhaustion attacks or targeted node isolation attacks.</p>
