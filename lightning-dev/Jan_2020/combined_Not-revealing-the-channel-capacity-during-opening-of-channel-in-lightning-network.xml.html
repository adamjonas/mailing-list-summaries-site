        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network is a decentralized system that uses proof-of-funds-locked for DoS resistance and to limit flooding the global routing table. However, non-lightning "channels" have been suggested as a compelling alternative. While discussing this topic, some argued that non-lightning channels, like a contractual agreement to settle up later between two mutually-trusting parties, could be quite compelling.During the discussion, Subhra Mazumdar raised concerns about not revealing channel capacity during channel opening, which can make channels susceptible to channel exhaustion attacks or node isolation attacks. This led to a debate about the trade-off between privacy and transparency in decentralized systems. Some participants suggested using smart contracts to enforce range proof and penalize fraudulent behavior to mitigate this risk.Matt Corallo proposed a solution to prevent routing nodes from overcharging transaction fees by defining a fixed and proportional max fee and selecting a random route that pays no more than those fees. In addition, Christian from c-lightning suggested setting up a fee budget of 0.5% and then selecting a random route within this constraint. The use of randomization helps protect privacy.Overall, the discussion highlighted the need to ensure the integrity and fairness of transactions while balancing privacy and transparency in decentralized systems.</p>
