    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A Lightning Network developer, ZmnSCPxj, suggested using a protocol that involves sending an encrypted version of the entire file instead of considering blocks of a file. The payment preimage serves as the decryption key, and knowing an additional zk proof is necessary to show that the file is indeed encrypted using the decryption key that is the preimage of the given hash. This method eliminates the need for dividing files into chunks and provides a single payment method. However, generating a zk-proof of some property of the entire file, which can be understood by an end-user, may not be possible. Therefore, it might be necessary to prove that a thumbnail of a video file is extracted from a frame of the video and then show that thumbnail to the end-user. According to Matt Corallo, Zk-proofs are incredibly fast these days for small-ish programs, and for relatively simple programs, a two-party system using them is very doable. He also suggested using Zero Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) to lock funds to a hash preimage, which could help in detecting whether data is correct or not.</p>
