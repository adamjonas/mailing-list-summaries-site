    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about privacy on the Lightning Network, ZmnSCPxj proposed a "maximally private" channel that uses only absolute locktimes. However, this proposal was deemed insecure by other members due to the existence of the "revoked by then" branch. Instead, they suggested using relative-locktime requirements for revocable outputs. ZmnSCPxj also noted that revelation of relative-locktime requirements would only happen in a unilateral honest close and could be hidden in a unilateral dishonest close caught and revoked. Mutual closes were considered to have good privacy but it was acknowledged that as Lightning becomes more stable, accidental unilateral closes may increase. Therefore, privacy for unilateral closes may need to be re-considered in the future.</p>
