    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Subhra Mazumdar, in an email to ZmnSCPxj, has asked if it is possible to lock just a partial amount of fund of a payment channel and leave the rest to be used by some other payment request. She referred to the concept of subchannels of a single channel suggested in "Atomic multi-channel updates with constant collateral in bitcoin-compatible payment-channel networks." In response, ZmnSCPxj asked for clarification on what exactly she was referring to as he found her question confusing.</p>
