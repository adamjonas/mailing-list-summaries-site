    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In the context, the sender is asking about applying conditions on the fraction of channel fund to ensure successful payment. They want to know if it is possible to lock only a partial amount of fund in a payment channel and leave the rest for another payment request. The concept of subchannels in a single channel has been suggested in "Atomic multi-channel updates with constant collateral in bitcoin-compatible payment-channel networks." However, the sender is still unsure about what happens during the closing of a subchannel.</p>
