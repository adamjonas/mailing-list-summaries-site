        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>A research paper titled "Imbalance measure and proactive channel rebalancing algorithm for the Lightning Network" has been published on arxiv.org. The paper details a protocol that increases the success rate of single-unit payments from 11.2% to 98.3% in a balanced network. Additionally, the median possible payment size across all pairs of participants increases from 0 to 0.5 mBTC for initial routing attempts on the cheapest possible path. The proposed algorithm conducts payments that optimally reduce the imbalance of nodes when conducting a (multipath) payment. The co-author of the paper, Rene Pickhardt, suggests that this protocol, combined with multi-part/path payments, could be the future of the lightning network. Furthermore, Pickhardt proposes extending BOLTs with two new gossip queries/replies, allowing nodes to initiate fee-free rebalancing operations. However, he notes that this extension needs protection against probing attacks to protect the privacy of nodes. He also addresses the potential for circular fee-free payments to be abused and suggests that open and transparent rebalancing cycles could be blocked if nodes feel they are being abused.Pickhardt is open to feedback and discussion on his proposals for BOLT extensions, particularly BOLT 14, which he acknowledges could be controversial. In response to an email, it was suggested that the rule used in the algorithm might be useful to guide how to split a payment for multipath payments.For example, if a payer Alice has channels to Bob and Charlie, and Alice-Bob has A=0.5, B=0.5, and Alice-Charlie has A=0.5, C=0.5, then in order to retain balance, if Alice has to pay 0.1, it should strive to split the payment into a 0.05 via Alice-Bob and 0.05 via Alice-Charlie. It was asked whether it would be possible to derive such a calculation from the published rule, where if one of the payer channels is imbalanced in favor of the payer, then the payment probably should not be split, but if the payment is big enough that it would be imbalanced against the payer afterwards, then some small amount must be split out to another channel.</p>
