        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Lightning Network faces challenges surrounding the trustworthiness of hardware and software. While some features can be stored on hardware, others require storage by the software, reducing trust in the node software. To reduce storage size, the hardware can store just a single commitment to the current state it knows to be valid. However, there is a need for secure forms of storage where at least one backup must be recoverable at all times within the penalty time window.The email exchange discusses the limitations of external hardware wallets in the context of Lightning Network. The goal is to have a hardware unit act as a signer for all Lightning-related transactions using a simple communications channel with the software. However, such a design cannot achieve what an onchain Bitcoin hardware wallet does. The author discusses the creation of a hardware unit that can act as a signer for Lightning-related transactions. Additionally, the hardware has to store two commitments to commitment transactions for each channel. The author also discusses how the hardware can prevent publication of our own commitment transaction by not signing it as it is created. Accepting payments has no trust or storage requirements, and there are methods for reducing storage size.The Lightning Network (LN) security model differs from the base layer, requiring on-chain monitoring and reaction to keep funds safe. Hardware wallets have not assumed UTXO state access as secure until now, but LN models require it. The Lightning-dev mailing list discusses reducing trust in node software and the hardware required to do so. One suggestion is to delegate publishing penalty transactions to a quorum of watchtowers. When opening a channel, the hardware should double-confirm with the user using its UI whether the paid fees are acceptable. For trusted forwarding, while forwarding should be automated and not require a confirmation from the user on the hardware unit UI, the hardware has to trust the software to actually perform forwarding correctly.</p>
