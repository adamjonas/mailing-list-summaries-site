    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email exchange, ZmnSCPxj discusses the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) routing and rebalancing in Lightning Network payments. They suggest that JIT routing is essentially a form of rebalancing and could be used to split payments via multipath, using the same algorithm as previously described. ZmnSCPxj also proposes a "lazy" balancing scheme that uses the MPP splitting algorithm to move towards balance when making payments or forwarding with insufficient funds. They suggest that this could be implemented as a C-Lightning plugin with a `suggestsplit` function and used by both the multipath payment algorithm and a putative JIT routing plugin.</p>
