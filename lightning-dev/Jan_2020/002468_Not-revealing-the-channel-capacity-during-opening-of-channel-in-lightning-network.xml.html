    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a recent forum post, Matt Corallo proposed an approach to prevent routing nodes from overcharging transaction fees. He suggested defining a fixed and proportional max fee and selecting a random route that pays no more than those fees unless no such route is available. He also recommended biasing towards old or good-reputation nodes, routing across nodes hosted on different ISPs/Tor/across continents, etc. Christian, from c-lightning, explained that they set up a fee budget of 0.5% and then select a random route within this constraint. They also fuzz the amount and other parameters within this range to obfuscate the distance to the recipient, i.e., slightly overpaying the recipient but simulating a shadow route. This randomization helps with privacy. Recent research results show that attempting to squeeze the very last bit of fees out has a detrimental effect on sender-receiver-privacy.</p>
