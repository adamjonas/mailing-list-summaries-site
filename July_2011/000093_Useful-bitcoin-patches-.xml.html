    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation, Christian Decker suggested that multithreading the RPC and adding Keep-Alive could be beneficial to everyone. However, the multithreaded RPC patches must undergo thorough testing to ensure they don't expose race conditions elsewhere in the code. The patches have primarily only been tested by miners so far. Regarding the 'hub mode', it is not a good idea as it would add a built-in DDOS mode flag to Bitcoin, making nodes aggressively connect to lots of neighbors. This would be bad because the network already has a shortage of sockets. People would ignorantly enable it, thinking they are adding resources to the network when in reality, they are consuming much more. Miners concerned with fast block propagation should manually addnode each other. Furthermore, there is room for longer-term improvements to the connection and forwarding logic. Although there are a few interesting ideas for those changes, there is no good way to test and validate them currently, so they are hesitant to publish them.</p>
