            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email conversation, Gavin Andresen expressed his opinion that neither of the two pulls were necessary for version 0.3.24. He also mentioned that fixing downgrade-to-0.3.24 was not a high priority since there was a possibility of downgrading to something before that version which would still do something reasonable. However, the other person disagreed with Gavin&#39;s opinion but eventually agreed to use version 0.3.24. The email included a digitally signed message attachment.</p>
