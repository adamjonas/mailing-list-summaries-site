            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a recent discussion, a concern was raised regarding the testing of the fixes in pull 358. The person asking the question was worried about the possibility of any issues remaining undetected. However, it was clarified that the only bug found recently was related to an error message ("Error: unable to load wallet.dat") that appeared when the ~/.bitcoin folder was empty or not present. This information was shared as a response to the initial concern raised by the user. Additionally, a digital signature was attached to the message as part of best practices for secure communication.</p>
