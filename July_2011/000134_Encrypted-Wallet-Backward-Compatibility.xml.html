            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Douglas Huff on July 4, 2011, the topic of breaking backup scripts was discussed. Gavin suggested that if the backup scripts use the backupwallet RPC command, then they will still work. Douglas went a step further and asserted that intentionally breaking unsafe or badly designed backup mechanisms is desirable, especially since import/export is planned to get merged at about the same time. However, he noted that doing so silently would not be ideal as people may not notice that they are backing up zero byte files.</p>
