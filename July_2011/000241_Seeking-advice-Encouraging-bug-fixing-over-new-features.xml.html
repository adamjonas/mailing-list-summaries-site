            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In this email thread, Rick Wesson expresses his opinion that if the software has fewer bugs, Bitcoin will be more valuable. He suggests offering a bounty for finding the right technical lead to help with the effort. Gavin is mentioned as currently leading the effort effectively, but it's unclear how much time he can dedicate to development versus other project-building efforts.</p>
