            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange, Rick Wesson suggests that offering a bounty for the person to lead the effort would be more effective than offering one for finding bugs. He believes that if the software has fewer bugs, then Bitcoin (btc) will increase in value. Gavin is currently leading the effort well, but there is agreement about paying him for his time spent on development over PR and other project-building efforts.</p>
