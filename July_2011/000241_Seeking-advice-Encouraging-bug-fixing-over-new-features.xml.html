            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread, Rick Wesson suggests that offering a bounty for finding the right technical lead would be more beneficial than offering a bounty for bugs. He believes that if the software works better with fewer bugs, then Bitcoin will become more valuable. Gavin is currently leading the effort but it is uncertain how much time he has to spend on development over PR and other project-building efforts. Despite this, Wesson agrees that Gavin should still be paid for his work.</p>
