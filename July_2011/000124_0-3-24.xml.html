            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1 builds are available for download, with SHA1: bb829e037aef86c5d9da384c0ff3c91ce8b11d5a Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1.tar.bz2. The builds are gitian signed and email signed as always. However, a few things need to be fixed up before release regarding build engineering. The issue has not been fixed since 0.3.21, and the developers have not yet had a chance to dig up a copy of Win98 and spin up a VM to test any results. The plan is to build on Ubuntu 8.04 instead of 10.04 so that other libcs can work and do thorough testing of that resulting binary on newer libcs specifically openSUSE 11.04. Jeff Garzik has tagged v0.3.24rc1, and Gavin Andresen suggests moving forward with git tip + whatever is needed to fix bugs in current tip.</p>
