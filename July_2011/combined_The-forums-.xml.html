            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The forums linked to bitcoin.org are causing frustration amongst users due to speculation, philosophical debates and repeated discussions. John Smith suggests replacing the link with a neutral forum that solely focuses on helping users, merchants and developers of Bitcoin. However, Matt states that there aren&#39;t enough people who could moderate such a forum. The discussion then turns to moving the official forum to a new URL due to the illegal content and bad reputation it is giving Bitcoin. Robert McKay suggests the development project should move to a new URL instead, but Matt believes that marking the forums as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper would be the best solution.</p>
