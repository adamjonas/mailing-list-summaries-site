            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a discussion between Matt Corallo, sipa, and gmaxwell on July 1st, 2011, they were debating whether to use cherry-pick or do a broad-based test of CWallet in version 0.3.24. While sipa and gmaxwell preferred cherry-picking, Matt suggested doing a test to find potential bugs before the release of crypto and version 0.4. However, he also noted that they shouldn&#39;t spend too much time on this minor update release and should focus on version 0.4 without interruption. The fact that it will be an -rc (release candidate) before the full release softens his concern. Matt had already done semi-automated testing of cwallet+crypto in both encrypted and non-encrypted states, which he didn&#39;t want to redo for cwallet alone.</p>
