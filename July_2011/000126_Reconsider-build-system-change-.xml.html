            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Pieter, a developer of the Bitcoin codebase, responded to John Smith&#39;s email regarding the choice of build system for the project. Pieter stated that he has no preference for any particular build system but would prefer a system that is easy to set up and allows building of the codebase on multiple Linux distributions, does cross-compilation to Windows, supports OSX, is easy to maintain, and can be adapted by other GUIs such as bitcoin-qt. He further added that if a system meets all of these requirements and is implemented and tested, he would have no problem choosing it for future versions.</p>
