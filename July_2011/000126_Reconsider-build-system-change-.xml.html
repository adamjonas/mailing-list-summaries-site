            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email chain dated July 2, 2011, John Smith questioned the decision to use autotools as the future build system instead of cmake. In response, Pieter stated that he had no preference for any specific project build system and would support one that met certain criteria. These criteria included it being easy to set up, allowing building on multiple Linux distributions, enabling cross-compilation to Windows, supporting OSX, being easy to maintain, and not being too difficult to adapt other GUIs to use it. Pieter emphasized that the chosen system would need to be implemented and tested to support all of these requirements before being selected for future versions.</p>
