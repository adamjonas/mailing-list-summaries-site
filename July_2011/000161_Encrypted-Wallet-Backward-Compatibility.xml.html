            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The author of the message did some digging and found a data structure in wallet settings that would cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash on load, rather than opening in a half-state or creating a new wallet. They added an empty object to addrIncoming, which doesn&#39;t appear to be used anywhere else in the code aside from its definition. This solution resolved all known issues and suggestions on newenc, except for invalid mlock calculations, which the author planned to fix immediately. They asked if anyone had any remaining suggestions or blockers on newenc and requested final ACKs on it.</p>
