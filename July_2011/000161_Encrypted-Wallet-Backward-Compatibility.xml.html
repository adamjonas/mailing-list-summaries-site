            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The writer did more research on a data structure in wallet settings that could potentially cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash instead of opening in a new wallet or some other incomplete state. They inserted an empty object in addrIncoming, which they believe will solve the problem and isn&#39;t used anywhere else in the code. They provide a link to the commit for others to review and ask if anyone has a different solution. They mention that this solves all known issues and suggestions with newenc except for invalid mlock calculations, which they plan to fix. Finally, they request any remaining suggestions/blockers on newenc and if none exist, they ask for final acknowledgments.</p>
