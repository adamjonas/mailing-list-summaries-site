            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange, Alan Grimes expressed his intention to implement his own version of the peer and wallet boxes in a Bitcoin diagram due to the existing code being &#34;completely untrustworthy&#34; and &#34;almost completely uncommented.&#34; However, another individual responded with frustration, stating that many people have attempted to write their own Bitcoin client from scratch when the existing code is already segmented into necessary pieces and comments are being added. The individual also argued that the current code is much more trustworthy than anything someone new would start to code, even if they had extensive comments for each line of code. Instead, the individual urged Grimes to help with an existing client library or the original client to contribute to the project.</p>
