    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the possibility of an emergency 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The proposed release would include sipa's flood limit fix, DNS seed enabled by default, and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. The idea behind enabling DNS seed by default is that a reliable hosting for DNS seed has been set up which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. Additionally, UPnP by default could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections and other P2P applications. There is no public outcry against these programs automatically opening holes in firewalls.Sipa's code has already seen an nLimit increase from 500 to 5000, which reduced syncup time by about 1.5 minutes, mostly in the early blocks. However, they need more dnsseed roots as Lfnet now reports 32843, making it an urgent matter to get more listening nodes. The checkpoint in 0.3.24 also needs updating since difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there.Jgarzik suggested including <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3a3eabb57ae41dd2162ca8230423abf4a90ef644">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3a3eabb57ae41dd2162ca8230423abf4a90ef644</a> to fix the no-connections-up segfault. Furthermore, CWallet needs a fix or two from <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/358.">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/358.</a> Lastly, it was suggested that multiple people should run DNS seeds to prevent occasional outages of DNS seeds.</p>
