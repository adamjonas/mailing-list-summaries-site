            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion is about whether to turn on the upnp feature in Bitcoin by default or not. A forum poll was conducted, which resulted in a 50/50 split between those who want it turned on and those who don&#39;t. One participant is in favor of turning it on in the GUI but leaving it off in bitcoind. Another participant opposes upnp but supports having it on as an alternative to not having it on at all. However, they think that a forum poll is not the right tool to use to decide if Bitcoin keeps working or not. They suggest using some other way to reasonably increase the number of listeners. The difference between bitcoin and bitcoind seems confusing to them since when someone complains about connectivity, they&#39;ll have to ask which one they are using. But enabling it for the GUI is sufficient in terms of network health. The discussion also touches upon the security concerns related to allowing Bitcoin to listen on port 8333 and the risks associated with outgoing connections. IRC connections are considered more concerning from a security perspective than upnp. One participant suggests giving preference in the form of preferred forwarding from/to nodes that we&#39;ve connected to vs connected to us, potentially improved relay rules, which would reduce the effectiveness of some DOS attacks.</p>
