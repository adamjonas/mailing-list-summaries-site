            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The conversation in this email thread revolves around the idea of paying bounties for fixing bugs in Bitcoin software. Gavin Andresen is skeptical of the idea, saying that while it may motivate some people to fix bugs, it would not encourage long-term contributors and could lead to hastily patched together solutions. The discussion then moves on to the possibility of branching releases for bug fixes and adding new features in separate branches. Finally, there is mention of someone getting paid to work on Bitcoin full-time, with more details to follow.</p>
