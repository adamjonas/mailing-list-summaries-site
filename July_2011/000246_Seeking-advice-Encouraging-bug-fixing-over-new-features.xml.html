    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email thread from 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his concerns about offering just a couple of bitcoins as a bounty to fix a bug. He believed that this would not only cause trouble for whoever was in charge of awarding the bounties but would also fail to motivate long-term contributors. However, he acknowledged that such a bounty could still encourage some people to fix bugs, though they might end up producing only hacked-together patches.Andresen also supported the idea of branching for releases, which some other projects had done successfully. He suggested starting with version 0.4 and branching for bug fixes to an 0.4 branch while adding new features to a head branch that would eventually be called version 0.5.Finally, Andresen mentioned that he had arranged to get paid to work on Bitcoin full-time, although he did not provide any details at that time.</p>
