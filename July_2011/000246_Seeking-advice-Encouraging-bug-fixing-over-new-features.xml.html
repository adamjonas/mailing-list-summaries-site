            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread, Gavin Andresen expresses his skepticism on the idea of awarding bounties for fixing bugs, stating that it may not motivate long-term contributors and may result in hacked together patches. He also supports the idea of branching for bugfixes and adding new features to a head branch to be eventually called 0.5. Additionally, he shares that he arranged to get paid to work on Bitcoin full-time before leaving for Australia and will provide more details upon his return.</p>
