            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The context discusses various features and fixes for Bitcoin, including native long polling support, a fix by Luke Dash Jr., hub mode, RPC turbocharge, and resource leak fix. The benefits and downsides of each feature are debated, with multithreading the RPC and adding Keep-Alive being seen as beneficial, while including long polling support and hub mode being less useful. HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support is noted as a feature that big pools have been requesting. Overall, the context includes a discussion of various improvements to Bitcoin and their potential impact.</p>
