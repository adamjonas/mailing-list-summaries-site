            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a discussion about potential updates to Bitcoin, various features were debated. Native long polling support was suggested but deemed unnecessary until Bitcoin is cleaned up, and a central notification interface was proposed instead. A fix from Luke Dash Jr. was recommended for merging as it had been tested and found stable. Hub mode was discussed but ultimately rejected due to concerns about generating too much net usage on listening nodes; it was suggested instead that connection logic be optimized for all nodes by default. RPC turbocharge was agreed upon as needed, and a resource leak fix was approved. The post also included a link to a document with several useful features, including HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support.</p>
