    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion on the Bitcoin developers' mailing list, various updates to the Bitcoin software were proposed. Multithreading the RPC and implementing Keep-Alive were deemed beneficial by most, while Native Long Polling Support was not seen as useful for many users. Hub Mode was also suggested, but one developer argued that opening up ports would be just as effective. A fix from Luke Dash Jr. was suggested and found to be stable by other developers. The Resource Leak Fix was approved. Jeff Garzik posted a link to a file containing several features, including HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support, which were requested by pools.</p>
