            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Matt Corallo wants to release version 0.3.24 as soon as possible in order to have enough lead time on version 0.4. He believes that any solution that is better in 0.3.24 should be in as many hands as possible, and the network issues can be resolved. Matt suggests to agree on either Github pull requests #378 or #381, but he prefers #378 because it is simpler and means that you don&#39;t have to keep track of what features you have or have not used in a wallet. However, he is open to either option and wants to get 0.3.24 out the door ASAP. In response to Gavin Andresen&#39;s email, Matt discusses the potential issues with encrypting unencrypted keys and the possibility of backup scripts breaking. They discuss future-proofing the wallet format by adding a minimum version requirement.</p>
