    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, is urging the community to agree on either of two solutions for an issue so that version 0.3.24 can be released as soon as possible. He expresses a preference for one solution because it is simpler and eliminates the need to keep track of features used in a wallet, but states he is willing to go with either option. In response to Gavin Andresen's suggestion for re-encrypting unencrypted keypool keys, Corallo disagrees, saying that if the keys are loaded but not added to mapAddressBook or setKeyPool, they will not be used for any new transactions or shown to the user, but the user can still receive Bitcoins to those keys. Corallo also notes that renaming wallet.dat can cause issues with backup scripts, and suggests adding a nMinVersion to specify the minimum version needed to read a file instead of renaming it.</p>
