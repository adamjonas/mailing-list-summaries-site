            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Matt Corallo, a developer at Bitcoin, is urging for the release of version 0.3.24 so that there is ample lead time on 0.4, allowing any solution to this problem to be available to as many people as possible. He is asking for agreement on either https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/378 or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/381. Ideally, rc2 for 0.3.24 will be released tomorrow and the final version will be released by the end of the week. Gavin Andresen raises concerns about keypool security and backup scripts in response. Matt suggests a solution for future-proofing the wallet format by adding nMinVersion which specifies &#34;you must be at least THIS version to read this file.&#34;</p>
