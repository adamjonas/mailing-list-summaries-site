            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a discussion thread from 2011, John Smith proposed using boost::signal mechanism to add notifications to the client and wallet. This would allow decoupling UI and core communication and eliminate the need for UIs to poll for changes. Wallet notifications such as balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification and askFee could be added. Suggestions were made for defining high-level information requests functions for transactions such as GetTransactionState, GetBroadcasts, GetInputs, GetOutputsToMe, GetOutputsToOthers and GetFee. Network client notifications such as numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged and notification were also discussed. It was suggested that these would need to be implemented as globals until a more modular structure was put in place.</p>
