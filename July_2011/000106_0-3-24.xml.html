            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion revolves around the release strategy for version 0.3.24 of Bitcoin. The debate is between cherry-picking selected fixes versus a broad-base test of CWallet in the new release before crypto and version 0.4. Matt expresses little preference on the matter while sipa and gmaxwell are in favor of cherry-picking. Jeff Garzik voices his concerns regarding cherry-picked branches, stating that they would have zero testing as most people have been testing 0.3.23 or upstream git. He also mentions that the convention wisdom is against cherry-picking but it is not a hard rule. Jeff suggests two options â€“ (a) 0.3.23 + select fixes or (b) current upstream + pull #358. His preference is for option (b), but he emphasizes that this decision should be made as a community.</p>
