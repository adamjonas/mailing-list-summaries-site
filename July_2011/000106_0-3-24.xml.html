            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The conversation revolves around the release of an update for bitcoin, with a debate between cherry-picking certain fixes and testing CWallet in version 0.3.24 before moving on to version 0.4. There are concerns about the disadvantages of cherry-picking, such as throwing away testing done on upstream git, creating a dead-end branch, and bug reports not being applicable to other versions. However, it is acknowledged that these rules are more like guidelines and the decision ultimately lies with the community. The preference is to release current upstream + pull #358 but comments are welcome.</p>
