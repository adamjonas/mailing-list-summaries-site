            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Pieter Wuille, a developer of the Bitcoin project, posted on Sun, Jul 03, 2011, expressing his openness to any project build system that meets certain criteria. He stated that he doesn't have a preference for any particular project build system as long as it is easy enough to set up, allows building of the bitcoin codebase on several linux distro's, does cross-compilation to windows, supports osx, is easy to maintain, and it is not too hard to adapt other GUI's to use it. He added that he won't have any problem with choosing that system for future versions if it gets implemented and tested to support all of the above.Pieter invited other opinions and asked if someone was interested in writing a cmake configuration for Bitcoin.</p>
