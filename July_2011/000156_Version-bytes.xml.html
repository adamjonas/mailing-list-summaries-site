            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email conversation, Pieter proposed the idea of resetting testnet and changing its addresses to odd=testnet and even=realnet. Stefan suggested using the XOR hack for now and removing it later on when they reset testnet. He also noted that using the least significant bit as a flag is cleaner. However, John expressed concern about breaking compatibility with older addresses and stated that building an image of stability and backward compatibility is important. Pieter agreed with the XOR 111 hack and mentioned that it makes testnet codes visually different from realnet ones due to the large number 111 being chosen. Additionally, Pieter noted that a modification to nVersion of less than 5 in absolute value can cause the first base58 character to remain equal. Finally, Pieter mentioned that +/- 111 is also possible instead of XOR 111.</p>
