    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email exchange between John Smith and Pieter, Stefan Thomas proposed the idea of resetting testnet, or simply changing its addresses. However, Pieter suggested using the XOR hack for now, with the intention of removing it when testnet is reset. Stefan agreed that this would be a good solution, as it would allow them to get rid of the "baggage" associated with using 111 as a flag. John voiced concern about breaking compatibility with older addresses, even on testnet, as he believed it was important to maintain stability and backward compatibility. Despite this, Pieter still favored the XOR hack, as it would visually differentiate testnet codes from realnet ones after base58 encoding. Additionally, modifying nVersion by less than 5 in absolute value could cause the first base58 character to remain the same. Pieter added that +/- 111 was also possible instead of XOR 111.</p>
