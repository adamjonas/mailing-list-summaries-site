            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The Bitcoin community is discussing the need for a 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The proposed release would include sipa&#39;s flood limit fix and dnsseed on by default, as well as UPnP enabled by default. Matt Corallo has set up a DNSSeed with reliable hosting that dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. However, multiple people running such a seed would be ideal to prevent problems with occasional outages of DNS seeds. Since it is no longer a static list, enabling DNS seed by default is suggested. UPnP by default is also a good idea to increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. The release should also include a block send limit and a bugfix for the no-connections-up segfault.</p>
