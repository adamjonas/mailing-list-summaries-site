            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>A discussion thread on Bitcoin&#39;s development mailing list proposed an emergency release, version 0.3.24, due to the flood control limits becoming an issue again. The release would include fixes for the no-connections-up segfault, and sipa&#39;s flood limit fix. Additionally, dnsseed should be enabled by default along with UPnP, which could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections, and block send limit. It was suggested that multiple people should run a DNS seed to prevent problems with occasional outages of DNS seeds once the move away from IRC is complete. There was agreement that these changes should be clearly explained in the release notes.</p>
