            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The email exchange discusses the importance of writing code and not just discussing beliefs. The author suggests that when it comes to coding, those who are actually doing it will win over those who only talk about it. They also mention that modern source control management systems don&#39;t have major issues with merge conflicts due to shared files. The email goes on to discuss the critical logic in blockchain validation, which requires identical decisions on all nodes and has a lot of corner cases that are difficult to test. Therefore, new, clean, secondary implementations of this logic are needed, along with good automatic testing shims to find inconsistencies between them. Testing rigs are suggested as an excellent area of work for people new to a project.</p>
