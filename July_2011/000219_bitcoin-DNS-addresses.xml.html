            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Rick Wesson has joined a list with the goal of producing a patch to support DNS lookups in rpc.cpp for sending coins. However, a member questions the use of DNS in transmitting something that could result in money transfer due to its insecurity. The member suggests the use of URIs as it is simpler and can give different addresses and values per user. They also recommend using HTTPS server with addresses and client support for better results.</p>
