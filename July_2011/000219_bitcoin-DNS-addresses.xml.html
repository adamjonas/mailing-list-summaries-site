    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A member of a mailing list, Rick Wesson, has joined with the goal of producing a patch to support DNS lookups in rpc.cpp's sendtoaddress. The purpose is to publish a TXT record in the DNS with a person's wallet address to make sending coins easier. However, someone questions why this is necessary when URIs are simpler and more useful for giving different addresses and values per user. Furthermore, DNS is not secure enough for transmitting something that will result in money transfer because it can be easily intercepted by malicious actors. Instead, a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support would work better for name-to-address mapping.</p>
