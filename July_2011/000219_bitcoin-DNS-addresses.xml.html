            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Rick Wesson joined a list with the goal of creating a patch to support DNS lookups for the sendtoaddress function in rpc.cpp. This would allow users to publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to make it easier to send coins. However, using URIs is simpler and more useful because it allows for different addresses and values per user. Additionally, DNS is not secure enough to transmit something that will result in money transfer. A simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support works better for mapping names to addresses.</p>
