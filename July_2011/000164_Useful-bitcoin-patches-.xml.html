            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The message is a discussion between Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik regarding several versions of Bitcoin. A link to version 3diff.txt with features that big pools have been asking for is included, but there is also a newer version available. Luke-Jr has made git branches for each logical part of version 3diff: hub_mode, threaded_rpc, signal_blk_notify, bugfix_CreateThread_leak, and getwork_dedupe. However, not all of these branches are seen as valid candidates for merging by Jeff Garzik. Some of the other proposed branches include coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, eligius_sendfee, txinfo, and bitcoinuri. URI support is considered nice, but some of the other proposals are viewed as useless feature creep or not necessary due to potential harm to the network. The message ends with a promotion for Splunk, an IT infrastructure data management tool.</p>
