            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange on July 10th, 2011, Luke-Jr posted a response to Jeff Garzik&#39;s announcement of version bitcoin-3diff.txt. The new version bitcoin-4diff.txt was linked and Luke-Jr had not yet compared the two versions. He then listed various git branches that he had extracted from the bitcoin-3diff version, including hub_mode, threaded_rpc, signal_blk_notify, bugfix_CreateThread_leak, and getwork_dedupe. Luke-Jr also suggested other branches that he considered valid candidates for merging, such as coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, eligius_sendfee, txinfo, and bitcoinuri. All of these branches were available from git://gitorious.org/~Luke-Jr/bitcoin/luke-jr-bitcoin.git. Finally, the email included a promotion for Splunk, a service that helps IT professionals make sense of data generated in their infrastructure.</p>
