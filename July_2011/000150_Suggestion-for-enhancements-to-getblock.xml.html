            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a conversation on July 7, 2011, Mike Hearn discussed the trust required for lightweight/SPV clients in regards to appearing deep in the chain. He stated that it is necessary to treat this as &#34;ipso-facto proof of validity&#34; and that there is no other way to do it. He provided an article link for reference regarding the security model. However, another forum post suggested that it could be done differently with a protocol change.</p>
