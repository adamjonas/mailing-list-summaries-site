            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a forum post, Mike Hearn suggests that appearing deep in the blockchain should be considered proof of validity. According to him, this trust is necessary for lightweight and SPV clients. He references an article on the Security Model of Bitcoinj to support his claim. However, another way to achieve this trust could be through a protocol change. The link provided leads to a forum thread discussing this potential solution.</p>
