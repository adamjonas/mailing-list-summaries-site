            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin forum, Mike Hearn suggested that appearing deep in the chain is considered proof of validity for lightweight/SPV clients, and it cannot be done any other way. He shared an article to support his claim. However, another member of the forum proposed a protocol change as an alternate solution to this issue.</p>
