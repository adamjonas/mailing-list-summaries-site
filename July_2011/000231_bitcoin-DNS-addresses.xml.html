    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In a discussion about the best method for resolving Bitcoin addresses, Rick Wesson and Matt agree that DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses is bad due to potential MITM attacks. DNSSEC is not a security measure for mitigating this issue because it requires its own DNSSEC enabled stub resolver. HTTPS is preferred as a method for resolution because it allows for the giving of different addresses to each client based on IP more easily. While HTTPS has only minor advantages over DNS, there are no advantages to using DNS over HTTPS. Matt prefers using an HTTPS library, which has undergone many thorough security audits, over a DNSSEC-implementing DNS recursion library with the root trust anchors and root servers built-in.</p>
