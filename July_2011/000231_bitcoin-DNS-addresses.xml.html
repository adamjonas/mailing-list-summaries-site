            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange, Rick Wesson and Matt discuss the best method for resolving Bitcoin addresses. Rick suggests DNSSEC, but Matt disagrees, stating that DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses is bad due to potential MITM attacks, and DNSSEC is not a security measure for mitigating this issue. Matt prefers using HTTPS as it allows for giving different addresses to each client based on IP much easier. While HTTPS&#39; advantages are small, DNS has no advantages that Matt can see. He also notes that there are many HTTPS libraries with more thorough security audits than DNSSEC-implementing DNS recursion libraries.</p>
