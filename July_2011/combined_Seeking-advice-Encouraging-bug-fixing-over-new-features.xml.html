            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion started with Gavin Andresen questioning the idea of awarding a couple of bitcoins to whoever fixes a bug, as it might not motivate long-term contributors and would only encourage quick fixes that don&#39;t entirely solve the problem. However, he did concede that it might still motivate some people. The conversation then moved on to the topic of branching for releases, which Gavin supported, despite some opposition from jgarzik. Rick Wesson suggested putting a bounty on the testing framework to reduce bugs in the software, but it was pointed out that there is already a boost testing framework implemented. Finally, they discussed the idea of paying Gavin for his work on Bitcoin full-time, with the consensus being that it&#39;s a good idea, but he may not have enough time to focus solely on development.</p>
