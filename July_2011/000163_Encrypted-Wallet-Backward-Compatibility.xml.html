            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On July 10, 2011, Matt Corallo shared his findings on a data structure in wallet settings that should cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash on load instead of creating an empty wallet or opening in a half-state. He suggested putting an empty object in addrIncoming and provided a commit link for this solution on Github. Corallo believed that although giving an incomprehensible/unrelated error is never ideal for the user, it's better than creating an empty wallet and confusing the user about where their wallet went. This way, a corrupt wallet can be avoided. Corallo also mentioned that this solution resolves all known issues and suggestions on newenc except for the invalid mlock calculations, which he will fix immediately. Pieter gave his ACK on newenc and thanked Corallo for all the work he put into it.</p>
