            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion in the email thread is regarding the removal of the forum.bitcoin.org DNS entry and the possibility of moving the development project to a new URL. It is mentioned that the forums are giving bitcoin a bad reputation due to illegal activities being discussed on them, which could lead to legal risks in the future. Therefore, it is suggested that the forums be marked as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper.</p>
