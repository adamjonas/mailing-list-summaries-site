            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a forum post in July 2011, Robert McKay suggested that the development project should move to a new URL and separate itself from the forums, which were giving Bitcoin a bad name due to the illegal activity discussed on them. Jeff Garzik responded by saying that Sirius was the only one with keys to Bitcoin.org DNS, but hopefully, he would change the forum&#39;s domain name to something like Forum.BitcoinTalk.org and remove the forum.bitcoin.org DNS entry. Another member named Matt expressed concern about the forums&#39; impact on Bitcoin&#39;s reputation and suggested marking them as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper.</p>
