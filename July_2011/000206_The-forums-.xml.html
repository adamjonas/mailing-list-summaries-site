            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In this email exchange, there is a discussion about the potential legal risks associated with the forums on Bitcoin.org. One individual suggests that the development project should move to a new URL to distance itself from the illegal activities being discussed on the forums. Another suggests that the forums should be marked as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper in order to prevent the negative association. It is noted that only one individual has the keys to the Bitcoin.org DNS, so any changes would need to be made by them.</p>
