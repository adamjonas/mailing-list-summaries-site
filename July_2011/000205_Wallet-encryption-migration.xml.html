            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In July 2011, Luke-Jr suggested two ways to improve the security of Bitcoin wallet files. The first suggestion was to overwrite old, unencrypted wallet.dat files with pseudo-random data in order to securely delete them. The second suggestion was to mark any keys imported from an unencrypted file as &#34;potentially compromised&#34; and never use them for new addresses. Arthur Britto commented on the post, saying that writing zeros just once may not be sufficient for modern Unix file systems, and that moving keypool addresses aside to prevent their use is a good idea. However, he also noted that there is currently no way for a wallet to be born-encrypted, so the only way to prevent a leak is to build the wallet initially on a ramdisk or similar device and then move it over after encrypting it. He agreed with Luke-Jr&#39;s second suggestion, which would make the key leak on a new wallet inconsequential since all keys in it are keypool keys at that point.</p>
