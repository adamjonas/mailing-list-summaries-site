            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The context is a discussion between Luke-Jr and Arthur Britto on how to secure-delete an old, unencrypted wallet.dat. Luke-Jr suggests overwriting it with pseudo-random data and marking all keys imported from unencrypted files as &#34;potentially compromised&#34;. Arthur Britto argues that writing zeros just once should be sufficient, but Luke-Jr points out that this may not work on modern Unix file systems. They both agree that moving the keypool addresses aside is a good idea, but lament that there is no way for a wallet to be born-encrypted. Luke-Jr&#39;s second suggestion would make a key leak on a new wallet inconsequential, since all keys in it are keypool keys at that point. They conclude that this measure should be taken.</p>
