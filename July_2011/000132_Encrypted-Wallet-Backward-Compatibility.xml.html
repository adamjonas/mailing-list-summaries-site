            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread from July 4th, 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed a solution to wallet encryption in Bitcoin version 0.4 and later. The proposal suggested creating an encrypted wallet file, wallet_e.dat, upon wallet encryption. The original wallet.dat file would then be truncated and its file-permissions set to 000 to prevent old versions of Bitcoin or any "dumb" wallet backup scripts from reading it. Andresen also mentioned the possibility of rewriting the old wallet.dat file before erasing it and replacing it with a placeholder, which could increase the chances of the old unencrypted keying material not being left on disk. The email thread did not provide further information on whether this proposal was implemented in future versions of Bitcoin.</p>
