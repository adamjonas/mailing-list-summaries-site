            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a conversation dated July 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen suggested a process for securing Bitcoin wallets through encryption. He proposed that version 0.4 and newer versions could create an encrypted wallet file called wallet_e.dat while truncating the original wallet.dat file and setting its permissions to 000. This would prevent old versions of Bitcoin or any faulty wallet backup scripts from being able to read the file and gain access to the unencrypted keying material. Additionally, Andresen suggested that rewriting the old wallet.dat file before erasing it and replacing it with a placeholder could further reduce the risk of leaving unencrypted data on the disk.</p>
