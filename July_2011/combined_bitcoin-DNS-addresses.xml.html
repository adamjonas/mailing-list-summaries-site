            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>A user named Rick Wesson has proposed to send coins using DNS lookups so that one can publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coin. However, Matt, another user, argues that using URIs is much simpler and more useful. Additionally, using DNS for money transfer is insecure as it is vulnerable to MITM attacks. DNSSEC can be used but implementing a full resolver with root trust anchors and knowledge of root servers is required which does not seem like a good idea. Matt suggests using a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support instead. Rick believes in DNSSEC but acknowledges that it may take many more years to enable the applications to leverage the deployed infrastructure.</p>
