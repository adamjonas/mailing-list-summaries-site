            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The flood control limits have become an issue again, and it seems that there needs to be a 0.3.24 release. The proposed changes include having sipa&#39;s flood limit fix, enabling dnsseed by default, and possibly enabling UPnP by default as well. The author has set up a DNSSeed with reliable hosting that dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections, and hopes others will follow suit. This was added to master in 44d16327, and since it is no longer a static list, the author believes it is time to enable dnsseed by default. Additionally, enabling UPnP by default could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. Jgarzik has also suggested this change, and the author sees no reason not to implement it. Finally, a commit should be included to fix the no-connections-up segfault.</p>
