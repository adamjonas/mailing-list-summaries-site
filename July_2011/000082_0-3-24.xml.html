            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The flood control limits have become an issue again, requiring a 0.3.24 release that includes sipa's flood limit fix and the enabling of dnsseed and maybe UPnP by default. The author has created a DNSSeed with reliable hosting that dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections and believes it is time to enable dnsseed by default. Other developers are encouraged to follow suit using the poorly done but functional GitHub repository. Additionally, the author suggests enabling UPnP by default as it could increase the percentage of nodes accepting incoming connections. Jgarzik has also suggested this change. Finally, a commit to fix the no-connections-up segfault should also be included in the release.</p>
