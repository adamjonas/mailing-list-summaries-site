            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The flood control limits have become an issue again, leading to the need for a 0.3.24 release. This release will include sipa&#39;s flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. Matt has set up a DNSSeed that fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. Since its no longer a static list, he thinks it&#39;s time to enable dnsseed by default. Additionally, he believes that UPnP by default would be a good idea as it could increase the number of nodes which accept incoming connections. Jgarzik has also suggested enabling UPnP by default, and Matt doesn&#39;t see much reason not to. Finally, there is a commit that needs to be included to fix the no-connections-up segfault.</p>
