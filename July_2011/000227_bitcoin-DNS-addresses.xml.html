    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The email thread discusses the security implications of using DNSSEC for Bitcoin address communication. The issue is that if an attacker controls the upstream resolver, they can claim that the requested zone is not DNSSEC signed and return their data. Most operating systems do not have a mechanism to require the queried zone to be DNSSEC signed, making it difficult to implement a full DNS resolver in Bitcoin for security. However, Windows, Unix variants, Mac OS X, and Android all support DNSSEC. The conversation also touches on the use of self-signed certs for important data transfer, which is deemed "stupid." The discussion shifts towards improving the usability of Bitcoin by simplifying the user experience, but there is disagreement on whether DNS-based resolving is a good idea. HTTPS is suggested as a better alternative, as it has several advantages over a DNSSEC-based solution without significant drawbacks.</p>
