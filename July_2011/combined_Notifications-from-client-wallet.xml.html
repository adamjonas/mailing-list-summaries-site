    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>A proposal to add notifications to the client and wallet has been put forward in order to decouple UI and core communication. Boost::signal mechanism has been proposed for this, which allows delivery of 'signals' from an object. Multiple other objects can listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. The proposal includes adding specific notifications such as balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, addressAdded, addressUpdated, and addressRemoved. A notification system for network clients has also been proposed, including numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification. The proposal aims to allow for clean separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites of one or another part without touching anything but the parts that are being redone. This should also allow for cool programs (like pushpoold/a block notification server/etc) to use Bitcoin as a library fairly efficiently.</p>
