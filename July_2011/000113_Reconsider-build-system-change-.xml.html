            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The decision to merge autotools was not a conscious one, but someone submitted an autotools patch and discussions about merging began. However, the autotools system needs to be redone before it can be merged. The choice of build system is up to whoever writes it, but autotools is more standard than CMake and does not require installation like CMake does. Some advantages of CMake over autotools include its support for cross-compiling, clearer syntax, speed, and native support in Qt Creator. A CMake build system for bitcoin already exists in rpcminer.</p>
