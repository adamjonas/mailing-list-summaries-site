    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>The discussion revolves around turning on UPnP by default in Bitcoin client. Although UPnP is bad for individual users due to more bandwidth usage, it is good for the network. The poll conducted showed that 55% voted against it and 45% were in favor of some form of on. Some suggested turning it on by default in the GUI and leaving it off in bitcoind. However, others disagreed as they found UPnP exemplifies what is wrong with computer security today. Douglas Huff suggests that this should not be a vote at all as network stability over the next 90 days is necessary. It is important to note that the default will only apply to pre-built binaries and not bitcoind. Thus, for people running bitcoind, this default doesn't matter at all.</p>
