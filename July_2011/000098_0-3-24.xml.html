            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion revolves around the issue of enabling UPnP in Bitcoin, which is seen as bad for individual users due to increased bandwidth usage, but good for the network. A poll was conducted on the topic, with 55% of respondents voting against it being enabled by default on bitcoind. However, some argue that someone needs to make the tough decision and turn it on for network stability over the next 90 days. Additionally, it is noted that bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on download archives, though it&#39;s unclear if this applies to OSX. The debate continues on whether convenience should trump security regarding UPnP and whether the default should apply only to pre-built binaries or not.</p>
