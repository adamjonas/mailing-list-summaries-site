        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>The author of the text discusses the activation methods for soft forks, which have not been given much attention despite recent progress towards their implementation and adoption. The author lists five basic requirements for soft fork activation, including avoiding significant objections, allowing time for high node-level adoption, not losing hashpower to un-upgraded miners, using hashpower enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process, and following the will of the community without overruling any reasonable objection. The author favors the BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for activation with 95% miner readiness, followed by a six-month quieting period and an optional BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month time horizon for flag-day activation supported by a command-line/bitcoin.conf parameter. The proposed method provides a long time horizon while still meeting the goals of the five requirements for soft fork activation.</p>
