            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The author is reopening the discussion on activation methods for soft forks in Bitcoin. They suggest revisiting the goals for both soft forks and their activation methods, including avoiding activation in the face of significant and reasonable objection, avoiding activation within a timeframe that does not make high node-level adoption likely, not losing hashpower to un-upgraded miners, using hashpower enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process, and following the will of the community while not overruling any reasonable objections. The author believes that BIP 9 effectively checks most of these boxes, but BIP 8 fails several requirements. The author suggests a standard BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for activation with 95% miner readiness, followed by a six-month quieting period if no activation occurs, and a simple command-line/bitcoin.conf parameter for users to opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month time horizon for flag-day activation if needed. The author emphasizes that developing Bitcoin is not a race and waiting up to 42 months may be necessary to avoid setting a negative precedent.</p>
