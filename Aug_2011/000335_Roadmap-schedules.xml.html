            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, wrote an email in 2011 outlining his priorities for the next few months. These priorities included network health metrics and finding a volunteer to be the Bitcoin Network Health Inspector, solving chronic problems with CRITICAL_SECTION deadlocks, wallet security and encryption, bug fixing, testing, and more research-y features such as Impolite peer detection and mining pool participant code. Andresen explained that software handling money requires more testing and code review. He also mentioned lower priority tasks that could be considered if they are important, non-controversial, thoroughly tested, and don&#39;t introduce any security vulnerabilities. Andresen planned to create a Roadmap page on the Bitcoin wiki if there is general consensus about priorities.</p>
