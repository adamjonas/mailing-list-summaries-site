            <p>In an email conversation on August 5, 2011, Andy Parkins stated that the specific rules were not important, but bandwidth is a better metric than connection count. The email also mentioned that there might be patches available that could solve the peak memory usage problem with additional connections, which would likely be of interest to many people.</p>
