            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email conversation in 2011, Stefan Thomas expressed his concern over the deployment of IGD protocol, which is supported by Bitcoin through UPnP. He cited that even though Wikipedia mentions that &#34;some NAT routers&#34; support it, he hasn&#39;t found any numbers on how widely the IGD protocol is actually deployed and that all routers he has seen had it disabled by default. He further added that it used to be enabled by default on most routers a couple of years ago but due to complaints from security researchers who considered it a &#34;huge security vulnerability&#34;, it is now typically disabled on most routers. The email signature also contains a digitally signed message part.</p>
