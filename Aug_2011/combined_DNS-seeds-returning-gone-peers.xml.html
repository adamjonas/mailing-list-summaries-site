            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The p2p network is experiencing a lack of connectable slots, and increasing the number of available connection slots may cause lower memory systems to run out of memory. However, there are a lot of bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds which is slowing down peer bringup for the Android apps. Only a few usable IPs are returned from the DNS seeds, causing issues with peer bringup. A custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version would be helpful for resolving this kind of thing. TheBlueMatt/dnsseed could be used as a reference for creating such a server.</p>
