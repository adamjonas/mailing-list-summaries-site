            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In August 2011, a discussion was held on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the split of the mainline client into separate executables. John Smith proposed that the current mainline client, which is currently lugged into one executable, should be split into three separate executables: bitcoind (Bitcoin daemon), bitcoin(-qt) (Bitcoin GUI executable), and bitcoincl (Bitcoin RPC command line). He suggested that all three would be built by default but in non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and bitcoincl would be built. Matt Corallo agreed with splitting off bitcoincl as it can be confusing how the client behaves as an RPC daemon or UI when no RPC command-line parameters are present. However, he was less sure about splitting UI and RPC as he often switches to RPC calls to inspect some details while running the UI. He also mentioned that bitcoin-qt is built using qmake, and the rest using makefiles, so it's more than just adding an additional makefile. Despite this, he suggested that bitcoin-qt should be merged into the mainline client, even if they have no maintained autotools. Finally, he asked about the process of building bitcoin-qt on Windows and OSX and whether they could switch everything to qmake.</p>
