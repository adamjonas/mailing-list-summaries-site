    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In this email thread, Gavin Andresen lists the issues on his priority list for the next few months. One of the issues is a chronic problem with new code causing CRITICAL_SECTION deadlocks (#453). Sipa proposes two solutions to solve this issue. The first solution is to rewrite everything into a single-threaded Bitcoin library that processes events in finite time without any separate threads. This would be a serious rewrite and could potentially limit growth. The second solution is a careful checking and rework of the locking system. Sipa suggests a system with one lock for the node-handling code, one lock for the wallet-handling code, and one lock for network-handling code, which would include functions that only need read-only access. Sipa also suggests moving towards reader-writer locks (boost's shared_mutex), which would require all inspector functions to be wrapped in a lock_shared/unlock_shared block, all mutator functions to be wrapped in a lock_upgrade/unlock_upgrade block, and data structure modification code to be wrapped in an unlock_upgrade_and_lock/unlock_and_lock_upgrade block. Another issue on Gavin's priority list is to move from wxWidgets to Qt for the GUI. Additionally, he wants to un-hardcode fee handling, and Sipa has proposed a draft for a reworked fee system but hasn't had the time to implement it yet.</p>
