            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In August 2011, John Smith proposed a change to the current mainline client of Bitcoin. He suggested that everything should not be included in just one executable and instead proposed having three separate executables: bitcoind for the daemon, bitcoin(-qt) for the GUI executable, and bitcoincl for the RPC command line. Another person misunderstood the proposal but came up with alternative names such as bitcoin-gui or bitcoin-qt for always starting the GUI, bitcoin-server for always starting the RPC server, and bitcoin-client for always running the RPC client. They also suggested having a script or symlinked executable with names "bitcoin" and "bitcoind" to detect whether RPC commands are present on the command line and invoke either bitcoin-server/bitcoin-gui or bitcoin-client based on it for backward compatibility. The context is related to the Bitcoin software architecture.</p>
