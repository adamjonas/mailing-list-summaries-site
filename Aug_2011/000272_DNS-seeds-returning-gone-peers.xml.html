    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>In an email conversation on August 3, 2011, Mike Hearn expressed concerns about bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds. He used the nmap command to scan the IP addresses returned by three different DNS seeds and found that only 19 out of 48 IPs were usable. This was causing peer bringup to slow down for Android apps. He also mentioned that a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers running the latest version would be helpful. Matt suggested using <a href="https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed">https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed</a> for this purpose or setting up a different DNS server that could pull directly from the database in a more dynamic way.</p>
