            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a conversation from August 3, 2011, individuals were discussing the implementation of Eligius mining for non-standard transactions. One individual suggested that with enough mining power, these transactions could still be mined effectively. However, another individual pointed out that propagation was also a concern and shared their own unsuccessful experience with a non-standard transaction. The conversation then turned to the idea of splitting the proposed changes into two pull requests: one for the uncontroversial IsStandard change and another for the full escrow feature set. This would allow for modified clients to be used on the main network before the escrow patch is implemented. Finally, there was a brief discussion about CScript.operator values and whether or not the current code produced the shortest possible sequence.</p>
