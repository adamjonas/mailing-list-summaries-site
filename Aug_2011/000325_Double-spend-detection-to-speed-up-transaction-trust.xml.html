            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The conversation started with Andy Parkins stating that "number of connection slots" is not the best metric for allocating bandwidth. He suggested to keep accepting incoming connections until the bandwidth is allocated, instead of limiting the number of connections. However, Mike and Matt were discussing outgoing connection count, which is a separate matter. Matt added that having 1000 Bitcoin connection still doesn't generate much traffic, except when a peer with an incomplete chain starts downloading, maxing out the bandwidth. His average monthly bandwidth usage for 125 connections was around 3GB, but there were brief spikes in outgoing bandwidth. Therefore, neither bandwidth nor connection count can be considered good metrics for selecting the number of incoming slots.</p>
