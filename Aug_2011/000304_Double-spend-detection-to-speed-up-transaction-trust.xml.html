            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email conversation on August 4th, 2011, Stefan Thomas suggested the possibility of network support such as MSG_DOUBLESPEND. However, this idea was met with skepticism due to the potential for such a service to connect to thousands of random nodes and become a DOS attack on the network which is already short on functioning listeners. Despite this concern, there are nodes in .ru/.ua that aggressively connect to some users without passing any transactions. Instead of network support, alerts are suggested as a better alternative due to their deeper network penetration, although they can be vulnerable to filtering by sibyl attackers. Alerts and network support can both have a place in the ecosystem and complement each other in different ways.</p>
