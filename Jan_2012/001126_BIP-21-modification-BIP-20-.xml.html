            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread from January 2012, Pieter suggests that a block number may not be the best way to represent Bitcoin&#39;s pulse as there is no guarantee of when a block will be discovered. He argues that the expires field is important for merchant purposes in limiting risk against currency or inventory movements. Regarding URI&#39;s containing a static pubkeyhash-address, Pieter believes they are only a temporary solution until more elaborate solutions are developed to deal with tagging transactions, feedback to merchants, and authentication. He thinks that static addresses are too limited for this purpose and dynamic approaches such as HTTP communication to negotiate an address would be better. Furthermore, he proposes keeping bitcoin URIs simple for now.</p>
