            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a Bitcoin forum post from 2012, Amir Taaki raised objections to the acceptance of BIP 20 as finalized since it was accepted before the official BIP process existed. Taaki believed that a BIP should go through the proper formalized motions in public before becoming accepted. However, Luke Dashjr disagreed and cited the version of BIP 21 that was agreed upon and can be seen on the Bitcoin wiki page. Dashjr also conducted three biased polls on the Bitcoin forum regarding BIP 20. Taaki stated that he did not observe the process for BIP 20 and therefore did not accept it. He invited anyone to submit a competing BIP to Luke&#39;s BIP 20, as had happened with BIP 16 and 17.</p>
