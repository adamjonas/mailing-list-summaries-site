            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email conversation on January 31, 2012, Amir Taaki expressed his views on BIP 20 and its lack of support among Bitcoin implementations. He noted that Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum, MultiBit, and Bitcoin-JS did not support BIP 20, and that the opinion of these widely-used GUI projects carried significant weight. While Bitcoin-Qt had a majority of users, Taaki discouraged using this as a reason to support or reject a proposal. Taaki suggested rejecting BIP 21 and creating a new standard, but acknowledged that BIP 21 was still a draft and largely copied from BIP 20. He mentioned a consensus forming on most parts of BIP 21, with the exception of the send private key and adding a time-to-expire field for merchants, which he supported. Taaki also criticized BIP 20 for being incompatible with established web standards that use decimal numbers. Matt, who was included in the email conversation, commented that the &#34;send crap&#34; was not part of the original spec and has since been removed from BIP 21. He also expressed concerns about adding an expire time field, given that BIP 21 was already implemented in all versions of Bitcoin-Qt.</p>
