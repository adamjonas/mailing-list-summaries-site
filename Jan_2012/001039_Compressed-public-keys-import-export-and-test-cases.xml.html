        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>Pieter has shared pull #649 which provides an import/export format for private keys with compressed public keys. According to the rationale, even though both compressed and uncompressed public keys have the same 32-byte secret, the import/export format requires a marker to identify whether the corresponding compressed or uncompressed public key should be used since they have different addresses. The uncompressed format is represented as 0x80 + [32-byte secret] + [4 bytes of Hash() of previous 33 bytes], base58 encoded, while the compressed format is represented as 0x80 + [32-byte secret] + 0x01 + [4 bytes of Hash() previous 34 bytes], base58 encoded. Pieter has included three test cases to test implementations with, each including the secret (in hex), uncompressed format with base58-encoded secret, pubkey in hex, and address in base58, as well as the compressed format with base58-encoded secret, pubkey in hex, and address in base58.</p>
