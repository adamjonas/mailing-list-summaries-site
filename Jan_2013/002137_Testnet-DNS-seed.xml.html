        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about the dumpfile produced by bitcoin-seeder, Peter Todd explains that it includes uptime information for all non-banned IPs that were successfully connected to. The connectability percentage is an average that decays over time with a constant of up to a month. Additionally, he mentions that he has a script ready to combine one or more seeds.txt&#39;s data into a pnSeed[] array C source code and plans to add it to the repository.</p>
