        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email dated January 10, 2013, Mike Hearn provided an update on the progress of bitcoinj and bitcoin-qt. He mentioned that the code is almost in a mergeable state and there are only a few minor tweaks needed. Some bug fixes were required on the bitcoinj side, including the deletion of the fallback to downloading full blocks and an API change. Adjusting the default FP rate was also necessary and was a part of larger API changes. He discussed the introduction of a new part to the filter protocol that allows clients to control auto-expansion. With auto-expansion disabled, the FP rate adjusted, and a bug fix on the bcj side, he was able to sync a wallet using a bloom filtered chain. Mike thought this work should go into 0.8 and that it would be more compelling to advertise it this way. Finally, he asked when 0.8 was targeted for freeze.</p>
