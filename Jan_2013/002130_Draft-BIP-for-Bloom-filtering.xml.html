            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange between Mike Hearn and Matt, Matt mentions that he wants to make a minor algorithmic change to the hash function before it gets merged. Meanwhile, Mike reports that Andreas has tested Matt&#39;s latest code, which seems to work correctly. However, the client had to be extended to refresh the filter every 25k blocks because even with the extra flag, the filter degrades into uselessness. Nevertheless, the situation has improved quite a bit and the current code is ready to be merged into 0.8. The code has been unit tested and reviewed by Mike several times, and also has an interoperable implementation that has been tested by Andreas in a build of his smartphone app. Mike requests Gavin to ACK the current code. After merging, the next step would be profiling to find any possible bottleneck or missed optimization.</p>
