        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In an email thread, Matt mentioned a minor algorithmic change that he would like to make to the hash function before it gets merged. Mike Hearn reported that Andreas tested Matt&#39;s latest code and it seems to work correctly. However, the filter needs to be refreshed every 25k blocks as eventually, it degrades into uselessness. Despite this issue, the situation has improved significantly. Mike proposed to ACK the current code and merge it into 0.8 since it has been unit tested, reviewed by him several times, and has an interoperable implementation that has also been tested by Andreas in a build of his smartphone app. Gavin was asked for his opinion on this proposal. The next step after merging would be profiling to optimize performance further.</p>
