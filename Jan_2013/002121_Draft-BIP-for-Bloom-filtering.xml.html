            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On January 10, 2013, Mike Hearn provided an update on the current state of Bitcoin development. He praised Matt&#39;s work on bitcoinj and bitcoin-qt, stating that they are only a few minor tweaks away from having all the code in a mergeable state. There were a couple of bugfixes needed on the bitcoinj side, including deleting the fallback to downloading full blocks and an API change. Adjusting the default FP rate requested by BCJ to be 0.0001 was also necessary, as well as introducing a new part to the filter protocol that allows clients to control auto-expansion. With auto-expansion disabled, the FP rate adjusted, and a bugfix on the bcj side, it was possible to sync a wallet using a bloom filtered chain. Hearn believed that this work should go into version 0.8, which would help network performance for everyone. If there were any showstopper problems, they would not deploy the code that uses the new messages into clients.</p>
