            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests that a boutique protocol could reduce the number of existing onchain wallets that could be integrated in such UI. The proposal suggests using a PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transaction) protocol for lightning network channel funding. Lightning node will generate a PSBT for a new channel with no inputs and a single output of the 2-of-2 address, which will be funded by the wallet but not signed yet. Lightning will determine txid from PSBT, and creates update/settlement tx&#39;s for funding tx so funds can be recovered. After this wallet signs and publishes the PSBT. Although it is more convoluted than an alternative proposal, it avoids passing NOINPUT addresses around or the risk of a user typo&#39;ing the value and losing money immediately. Moreover, it has the benefit that the wallet can tweak the value if that enhances privacy. Overall, it seems like a fair tradeoff.</p>
