        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation discusses the proposal of &#34;RBF-pinning&#34; problem in Bitcoin transactions. The proposal suggests a relay policy where children of marked transactions as &#34;likely-to-be-RBF&#39;ed&#34; would be rejected unless the resulting package would be &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34;. However, this could still fail to confirm within a handful of blocks given block time variance. It also restricts the ability to RBF/CPFP more than once in case the fee moves away from us, which is a significant limitation. The original proposal was considered a hack, but it works on the boundary condition where packages meet local anti-DoS rules in violation of the &#34;incentive compatible&#34; goal. Matt Corallo suggested an alternative proposal, which Rusty Russell found interesting and incentive-compatible. It reduces the problem that the current lightning proposal adds to the UTXO set with two anyone-can-spend txs for 1000 satoshis. However, it relies on some form of package relay, which comes with its own challenges.</p>
