            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In this conversation, Matt Corallo proposed an alternative to the RBF-pinning proposal by allowing transactors to mark their transactions as &#34;likely-to-be-RBF&#39;ed&#34;, which could enable a relay policy where children of such transactions would be rejected unless the resulting package would be &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34;. Although it theoretically implies that such attacks are not possible to pull off consistently, Rusty Russell pointed out that defining a &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34; criteria is fraught with issues and may not work for Lightning&#39;s requirements. Furthermore, if the &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34; criteria is not &#34;near the top of the next block&#34;, there is a high probability that the transaction in question may not confirm within a handful of blocks given block time variance. Additionally, giving up the ability to RBF/CPFP more than once in case the fee moves away from us seems to be a rather significant restriction. Rusty Russell liked the idea of the RBF-pinning proposal because it is incentive-compatible and reduces the problem that the current lightning proposal adds to the UTXO set with two anyone-can-spend txs for 1000 satoshis. However, he suggested that package relay may come with its own challenges, but this could be done client-side.</p>
