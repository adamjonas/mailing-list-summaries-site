            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The discussion is about solving the RBF-pinning problem by allowing transactors to mark their transactions as &#34;likely-to-be-RBF&#39;ed&#34;, which could enable a relay policy where children of such transactions would be rejected unless the resulting package would be &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34;. This proposal is incentive-compatible, and it reduces the problem that the current lightning proposal adds to the UTXO set with two anyone-can-spend txs for 1000 satoshis. However, defining a &#34;near the top of the mempool&#34; criteria is fraught with issues because Lightning&#39;s requirements are very different from large batched transactions. Lightning operators want certainty that the transaction will confirm by some deadline and not just a high probability that it will confirm &#34;soon,&#34; which can lead to sudden spikes in transaction volume. Moreover, the proposal doesn&#39;t guarantee the ability to RBF as fees change. Even steady-state mempool growth wouldn&#39;t hold up the criteria because of block time variance. The attack against this proposal is to make a 100k package, which would just get into the &#34;top,&#34; then push it out with a separate tx at slightly higher fee, then repeat.</p>
