            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a message to bitcoin-dev, Anthony Towns mentions that the latest segwit code has a version 0 witness format and treats a 32 byte push as the sha256 of a script and a 20 byte push as the hash of the pub key. He also notes that this change means segwit p2pkh needs 31 bytes per output instead of 36 bytes, giving another couple of percent gain. The article provides various tables showing the differences in size and efficiency between p2pkh, 2-of-2 msig, and segwit for both non-segwit-aware wallets and segwit-aware wallets. Additionally, p2pkh with segwit-via-p2sh is discussed, which could be interesting even if customers just use non-segwit-aware wallets with a p2sh address that&#39;s only redeemable by a segwit-aware wallet.</p>
