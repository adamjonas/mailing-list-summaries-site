            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The vulnerability of P2SH in the event of an attack on RIPEMD160 is discussed in a bitcoin-dev mailing list. The use of P2SH makes anything vulnerable if there is an attack on RIPEMD160, reducing its security only marginally. This vulnerability was not anticipated during the design of P2SH. The discussion highlights the concern of constructing a 2-of-2 multisig escrow in a contract where an attacker can steal H(A and B) with H(B and C). The current lightning-network design at channel establishment would also be affected by this attack. To prevent this, exchanging hashes of pubkeys first could be implemented, but it adds complexity to the already challenging task of getting contracts on bitcoin right.</p>
