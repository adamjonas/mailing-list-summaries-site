            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, Gavin Andresen proposed eliminating a somewhat unlikely attack by having just one version of the witness program. However, Pieter Wuille disagreed with the proposal, stating that it would reduce the security target for witness scripts to 80 bits, which is not wise since Bitcoin has a 128-bit security target for everything else. Wuille suggested that a version 0 witness program, which is RIPEMD160(SHA256(script)), be implemented instead. He also expressed disappointment with the &#34;Here&#39;s the spec, take it or leave it&#34; attitude and emphasized that they are just making a proposal and hoping that the ecosystem will adopt it.</p>
