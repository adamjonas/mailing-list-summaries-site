        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Gavin Andresen proposed a version 0 witness program to eliminate the chance of a bug in the code or test cases. However, Pieter Wuille argued against it, stating that Bitcoin has a 128-bit security target and reducing it to 80 bits is not wise. He also expressed disappointment with the &#34;Here&#39;s the spec, take it or leave it&#34; attitude and emphasized that they are making a proposal and hoping for adoption due to its technical merit.</p>
