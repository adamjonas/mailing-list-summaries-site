            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The effective block size for p2pkh with segwit is estimated to be 1.7MB, which is higher than the previously estimated 1.6MB. For 2/2 multisig, the estimated block size is still accurate at 2MB. Additional post-segwit soft-forked script improvements can further increase the effective block size for p2pkh transactions from 1.7MB to 1.9MB and for 2/2 multisig from 2MB to 2.5MB/3MB. Segwit makes two soft-fork improvements possible, namely ecdsa public key recovery and schnorr signatures, which can improve the space efficiency of both multisig and p2pkh. The revised figures suggest that there could be a 170% increase in the number of transactions per block for p2pkh, while multisig could see an increase of 200%. These estimates assume that the number of inputs will be roughly the same as the number of outputs. However, if a 2MB hard fork is done first, then the 1/4 discount for segwit could mean up to 8MB of total data per block, which is currently infeasible. Without discounting, segwit comes at a slight cost in transactions per block, and additional soft forks will only result in a 25% gain for p2pkh and 50%-100% for 2-of-2 multisig. The caveat is that additional metadata might also need to be accounted for, such as the length for each witness signature or the value of the input.</p>
