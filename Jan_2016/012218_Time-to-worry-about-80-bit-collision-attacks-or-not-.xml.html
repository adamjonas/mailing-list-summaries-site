            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In January 2016, Gavin Andresen wrote on bitcoin-dev mailing list asking for confirmation if he correctly followed the specifics of the collision attack. The attack is performed by an attacker who is in the middle of establishing a payment channel with someone. The victim gives their public key to the attacker, who creates an innocent fund-locking script &#39;2 V A 2 CHECKMULTISIG&#39; (V is victim&#39;s public key, A is attacker&#39;s) but does not give it to the victim yet. Using Ethan Heilman&#39;s procedure, the attacker can create two scripts which hash to the same result. The attacker can make the form of the script be a function of their key and cycle through multiple attempts until they get a usable pair with under 3*2**80 work. In a python implementation with weakened hash function, a useful collision was obtained in the second attempt in about 7 seconds.</p>
