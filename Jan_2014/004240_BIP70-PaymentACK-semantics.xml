        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>The conversation between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn revolves around the topic of CoinJoin and the specifications for broadcasting transactions. While the spec does not specify when to broadcast versus when to submit via HTTP, it is noted that if wallets were required to wait for a PaymentACK before broadcasting, it would make implementing CoinJoin more difficult. The discussion also touches on the importance of retrying if a payment_url is unavailable and the potential complexities in handling failed payments. Ultimately, while it may be preferred to not broadcast immediately, there are cases where it cannot be enforced.</p>
