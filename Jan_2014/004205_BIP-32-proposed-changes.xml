        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>Pieter has created a pull request with a rewritten version of BIP 32. The changes are intended to make it more readable based on feedback received. The changes include not reusing the terminology &#39;public&#39; vs &#39;private&#39; for the alternate derivation scheme, but instead calling them &#34;hardened&#34;. Additionally, explicit type conversion functions have been added and the &#39; suffix is no longer used to mean &#34;alternate&#34; in two different meanings. Instead, the &#39;h&#39; suffix is used to mean hardened, and CKDpriv and CKDpub are used for the derivation functions that operate on private and public keys. These are just documentation changes and the semantics remain unchanged. Comments are welcome on the pull request.</p>
