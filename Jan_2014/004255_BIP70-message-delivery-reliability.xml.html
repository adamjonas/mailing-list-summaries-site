            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a 2014 email exchange between Chuck and Mike Hearn, the two discussed the upcoming release of the Bitcoin Core and bitcoinj protocols. Mike stated that any changes from this point on would have to be backwards compatible. Chuck expressed concern about failure situations and the need to address potential problems with minor changes now rather than trying to patch solutions later. He pointed out that a malicious merchant could claim they never received a payment message or a faulty network connection could prevent a message from being delivered. As the current specification does not suggest retrying failed messages, Chuck believed the memo and refund addresses were useless. While he acknowledged that Pieter&#39;s proposal for a more atomic protocol may be too far-reaching at this point, he urged the specification to prevent transactions from confirming without payment messages being delivered.</p>
