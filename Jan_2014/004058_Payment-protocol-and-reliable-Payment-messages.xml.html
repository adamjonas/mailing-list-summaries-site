        <h3> Summary:</h3>
        <p>In a discussion about the use cases of stealth addresses, Pieter brings up the issue of the optional &#34;payment_url&#34; field in BIP70. He argues that if the Payment message is not sent to this location, the &#34;memo&#34;, &#34;refund&#34;, and &#34;merchant_data&#34; fields become useless, which could result in anonymous senders losing their funds without a way to retrieve them. Pieter suggests that the Payment message be made mandatory and formulated as &#34;location where a Payment message must be attempted to be sent to&#34;. He also proposes an optimization where transactions are only sent to the payment URL to minimize the risk of confirmation without payment.</p>
