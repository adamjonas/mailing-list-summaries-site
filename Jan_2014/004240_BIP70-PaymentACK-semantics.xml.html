            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email exchange between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn in 2014, they discussed the issue of broadcasting transactions and the use of PaymentACK. If a wallet is doing automatic CoinJoin, then other participants will typically broadcast the transaction as soon as it&#39;s complete. However, if the specification says that wallets must not broadcast until they receive a PaymentACK, then this would violate the spec to do CoinJoin. It was suggested that not broadcasting if a payment_uri is present could minimize the risk of unreliable memo and refund addresses, but there are enough cases where this cannot be enforced. If a payment_url is unavailable, it&#39;s recommended to retry and even if you don&#39;t care about CoinJoin, not broadcasting the transaction as soon as the inputs are signed adds implementation complexity.</p>
