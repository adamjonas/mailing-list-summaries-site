            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In a discussion about the Bitcoin payment protocol, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik debated whether merchants or customers should be responsible for getting transactions confirmed. The goal is to provide the customer with the best experience possible. However, there are issues with the current implementation in Bitcoin Core that make it difficult for merchants to utilize refund or memo features. If a merchant&#39;s receive server is down when a transaction is made, funds could potentially be lost, making these fields useless. To address this problem, Pieter proposes adding several measures to the specification, such as requiring clients to attempt to send payments to a payment_uri and making reasonable attempts to deliver payments if sending fails. Ultimately, the focus is on creating a bidirectional payment protocol that benefits both merchants and customers.</p>
