            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Pieter has created a pull request for BIP 32, which is a rewritten version of it to make it more readable. The changes made include not reusing the terminology &#39;public&#39; vs &#39;private&#39; for the alternate derivation scheme; instead, calling them &#34;hardened&#34;. Additionally, explicit type conversion functions were added, and the &#39; suffix was not used to mean &#34;alternate&#34; in two different meanings. Instead, the &#39;h&#39; suffix was utilized to mean hardened, and CKDpriv and CKDpub were used for the derivation functions that operate on private and public keys. Pieter clarifies that these are just documentation changes and that the semantics are unchanged. He welcomes comments, which can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/12.</p>
