            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>The conversation is regarding the discussion of Mt Gox related stuff on Bitcoin-development. One person believes that it&#39;s not related to the core software, but another person argues that MtGox&#39;s code is just as related as any other Bitcoin software. However, the issue with Mt Gox&#39;s code is that it&#39;s closed source, meaning nobody can do anything about it. The conversation also touches on the disclosure of security vulnerabilities and emphasizes the importance of keeping those private for a reasonable amount of time for them to be fixed.</p>
