            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread dated June 17, 2011, John Smith notified the group that his Qt GUI was ready for merging. He inquired about the roadmap for including the autotools build system so that multiple GUIs could be supported, potentially in version 0.4.0. Pieter voiced his support for merging autotools unless there were known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. Pieter also suggested that if the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, it should be merged under certain conditions, including minimal/trivial changes to the &#39;core&#39; and being marked as &#39;experimental&#39; and not enabled by default. The only disadvantage of another GUI is the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now require changes in 3 places instead of 2, but more people are willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</p>
