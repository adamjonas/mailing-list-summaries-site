    <h3> Summary:</h3>
    <p>On June 17, 2011, John Smith sent an email suggesting that his Qt GUI was ready for merging into the current roadmap. He also inquired about the timeline for incorporating the autotools build system to support multiple GUIs. Pieter, in response, expressed his approval for merging the autotools build system unless there were any known issues with it. He also suggested merging the Qt port under certain conditions, such as minimal changes to the 'core' and marking it 'experimental' and not enabled by default. Pieter acknowledged the disadvantage of another GUI, which would require necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code to be made in 3 places instead of 2. However, he mentioned that there are more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</p>
