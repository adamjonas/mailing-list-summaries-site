            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In this context, the discussion is about adding wallet encryption and import/export features to Bitcoin v0.4 for further wallet security purposes. Sipa has already rebased his showwallet tree, which is in a functional state but missing the segfault fix. Jeff Garzik believes that wallet crypto and import/export are the two &#34;must-have&#34; features for v0.4, and other things like autotools can wait if they hold up the release of wallet crypto. Meanwhile, Doug Huff acknowledges that sipa&#39;s showwallet tree is not entirely ready for pulling yet. The email also includes a promotional message from Splunk about the value of IT infrastructure data.</p>
