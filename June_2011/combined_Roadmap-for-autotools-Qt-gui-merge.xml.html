            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>Pieter Wuille, a developer of Bitcoin, has posted on the BitcoinTalk forum that there seems to be a consensus to merge autotools and qtgui. However, autotools is not tested enough on native windows and osx platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch, which Pieter wants people to test to see if it compiles and works on several systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw cross-compile, and OSX. Pieter also mentions that for him, it works on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui. In another post from John Smith, he believes that his Qt GUI is ready for merging and that he has been using it for a while with all functionality working. He also inquires about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs, mentioning version 0.4.0 as a possibility. Pieter responds that he is in favor of merging autotools now unless there are still known issues with it such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, Pieter would vote to have it merged as well under the conditions that the changes to the "core" are minimal or trivial and marked as "experimental" and not enabled by default.</p>
