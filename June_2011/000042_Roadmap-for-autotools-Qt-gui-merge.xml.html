            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On June 17, 2011, John Smith sent an email stating that he believed his Qt GUI was ready for merging. He was asking about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system to support multiple GUIs. The consensus seems to be to merge autotools and qtgui. However, autotools is not tested enough on native Windows and OS X platforms. Therefore, Pieter requested anyone with either development environment and willingness to test to help out.</p>
