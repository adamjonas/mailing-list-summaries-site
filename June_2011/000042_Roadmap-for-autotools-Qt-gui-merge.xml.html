            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>In an email thread on June 17, 2011, John Smith informed the group that his Qt GUI is ready for merging, having tested it and found all functionality working. He then inquired about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that multiple GUIs could be supported, asking if this would happen in version 0.4.0. The consensus among the group was to merge autotools and qtgui; however, it was noted that autotools had not been tested thoroughly enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. Pieter requested anyone with a development environment and willingness to test on these platforms to come forward.</p>
