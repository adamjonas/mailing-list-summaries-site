            <h3> Summary:</h3>
            <p>On June 19, 2011, Pieter Wuille posted a message discussing the possibility of merging autotools and qtgui. While there seems to be a consensus in favor of this proposal, it was noted that autotools has not been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch but needs people to test if it compiles and works on several systems including Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, Fedora(?), mingw cross-compile, and OSX. The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/autotools3.">https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/autotools3.</a> It was mentioned that the code works on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.</p>
